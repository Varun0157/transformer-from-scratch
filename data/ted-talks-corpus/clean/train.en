david gallo this is bill lange im dave gallo
and were going to tell you some stories from the sea here in video
weve got some of the most incredible video of titanic thats ever been seen and were not going to show you any of it
the truth of the matter is that the titanic even though its breaking all sorts of box office records its not the most exciting story from the sea
and the problem i think is that we take the ocean for granted
when you think about it the oceans are percent of the planet
most of the planet is ocean water
the average depth is about two miles
part of the problem i think is we stand at the beach or we see images like this of the ocean and you look out at this great big blue expanse and its shimmering and its moving and theres waves and theres surf and theres tides but you have no idea for what lies in there
and in the oceans there are the longest mountain ranges on the planet
most of the animals are in the oceans
most of the earthquakes and volcanoes are in the sea at the bottom of the sea
the biodiversity and the biodensity in the ocean is higher in places than it is in the rainforests
its mostly unexplored and yet there are beautiful sights like this that captivate us and make us become familiar with it
but when youre standing at the beach i want you to think that youre standing at the edge of a very unfamiliar world
we have to have a very special technology to get into that unfamiliar world
we use the submarine alvin and we use cameras and the cameras are something that bill lange has developed with the help of sony
marcel proust said the true voyage of discovery is not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having new eyes
people that have partnered with us have given us new eyes not only on what exists the new landscapes at the bottom of the sea but also how we think about life on the planet itself
heres a jelly
its one of my favorites because its got all sorts of working parts
this turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans
it gets up to about feet long
but see all those different working things
its got these fishing lures on the bottom theyre going up and down
its got tentacles dangling swirling around like that
its a colonial animal
these are all individual animals banding together to make this one creature
and its got these jet thrusters up in front that itll use in a moment and a little light
if you take all the big fish and schooling fish and all that put them on one side of the scale put all the jelly type of animals on the other side those guys win hands down
most of the biomass in the ocean is made out of creatures like this
heres the x wing death jelly
the bioluminescence they use the lights for attracting mates and attracting prey and communicating
we couldnt begin to show you our archival stuff from the jellies
they come in all different sizes and shapes
bill lange we tend to forget about the fact that the ocean is miles deep on average and that were real familiar with the animals that are in the first or feet but were not familiar with what exists from there all the way down to the bottom
and these are the types of animals that live in that three dimensional space that micro gravity environment that we really havent explored
you hear about giant squid and things like that but some of these animals get up to be approximately feet long
theyre very little understood
dg this is one of them another one of our favorites because its a little octopod
you can actually see through his head
and here he is flapping with his ears and very gracefully going up
we see those at all depths and even at the greatest depths
they go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet
they come right up to the submarine theyll put their eyes right up to the window and peek inside the sub
this is really a world within a world and were going to show you two
in this case were passing down through the mid ocean and we see creatures like this
this is kind of like an undersea rooster
this guy that looks incredibly formal in a way
and then one of my favorites what a face
this is basically scientific data that youre looking at
its footage that weve collected for scientific purposes
and thats one of the things that bills been doing is providing scientists with this first view of animals like this in the world where they belong
they dont catch them in a net
theyre actually looking at them down in that world
were going to take a joystick sit in front of our computer on the earth and press the joystick forward and fly around the planet
were going to look at the mid ocean ridge a mile long mountain range
the average depth at the top of it is about a mile and a half
and were over the atlantic thats the ridge right there but were going to go across the caribbean central america and end up against the pacific nine degrees north
we make maps of these mountain ranges with sound with sonar and this is one of those mountain ranges
were coming around a cliff here on the right
the height of these mountains on either side of this valley is greater than the alps in most cases
and theres tens of thousands of those mountains out there that havent been mapped yet
this is a volcanic ridge
were getting down further and further in scale
and eventually we can come up with something like this
this is an icon of our robot jason its called
and you can sit in a room like this with a joystick and a headset and drive a robot like that around the bottom of the ocean in real time
one of the things were trying to do at woods hole with our partners is to bring this virtual world this world this unexplored region back to the laboratory
because we see it in bits and pieces right now
we see it either as sound or we see it as video or we see it as photographs or we see it as chemical sensors but we never have yet put it all together into one interesting picture
heres where bills cameras really do shine
this is whats called a hydrothermal vent
and what youre seeing here is a cloud of densely packed hydrogen sulfide rich water coming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor
gets up to degrees f somewhere in that range
so thats all water under the sea a mile and a half two miles three miles down
and we knew it was volcanic back in the
and then we had some hint that these things existed all along the axis of it because if youve got volcanism waters going to get down from the sea into cracks in the sea floor come in contact with magma and come shooting out hot
we werent really aware that it would be so rich with sulfides hydrogen sulfides
we didnt have any idea about these things which we call chimneys
this is one of these hydrothermal vents
six hundred degree f water coming out of the earth
on either side of us are mountain ranges that are higher than the alps so the setting here is very dramatic
bl the white material is a type of bacteria that thrives at degrees c
dg i think thats one of the greatest stories right now that were seeing from the bottom of the sea is that the first thing we see coming out of the sea floor after a volcanic eruption is bacteria
and we started to wonder for a long time how did it all get down there
what we find out now is that its probably coming from inside the earth
not only is it coming out of the earth so biogenesis made from volcanic activity but that bacteria supports these colonies of life
the pressure here is pounds per square inch
a mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles no sun has ever gotten down here
all the energy to support these life forms is coming from inside the earth so chemosynthesis
and you can see how dense the population is
these are called tube worms
bl these worms have no digestive system they have no mouth
but they have two types of gill structures
one for extracting oxygen out of the deep sea water another one which houses this chemosynthetic bacteria which takes the hydrothermal fluid that hot water that you saw coming out of the bottom and converts that into simple sugars that the tube worm can digest
dg you can see heres a crab that lives down there
hes managed to grab a tip of these worms
now they normally retract as soon as a crab touches them
oh good going
so as soon as a crab touches them they retract down into their shells just like your fingernails
theres a whole story being played out here that were just now beginning to have some idea of because of this new camera technology
bl these worms live in a real temperature extreme
their foot is at about degrees c and their head is out at three degrees c so its like having your hand in boiling water and your foot in freezing water
thats how they like to live
dg this is a female of this kind of worm
and heres a male
you watch it doesnt take long before two guys here this one and one that will show up over here start to fight
everything you see is played out in the pitch black of the deep sea
there are never any lights there except the lights that we bring
here they go
on one of the last dive series we counted species in these areas were new new species
bl one of the big problems is that for the biologists working at these sites its rather difficult to collect these animals
and they disintegrate on the way up so the imagery is critical for the science
dg two octopods at about two miles depth
this pressure thing really amazes me that these animals can exist there at a depth with pressure enough to crush the titanic like an empty pepsi can
what we saw up till now was from the pacific
this is from the atlantic even greater depth
you can see this shrimp is harassing this poor little guy here and hell bat it away with his claw whack
and the same things going on over here
what theyre getting at is that on the back of this crab the foodstuff here is this very strange bacteria that lives on the backs of all these animals
and what these shrimp are trying to do is actually harvest the bacteria from the backs of these animals
and the crabs dont like it at all
these long filaments that you see on the back of the crab are actually created by the product of that bacteria
so the bacteria grows hair on the crab
on the back you see this again
the red dot is the laser light of the submarine alvin to give us an idea about how far away we are from the vents
those are all shrimp
you see the hot water over here here and here coming out
theyre clinging to a rock face and actually scraping bacteria off that rock face
heres a tiny little vent thats come out of the side of that pillar
those pillars get up to several stories
so here youve got this valley with this incredible alien landscape of pillars and hot springs and volcanic eruptions and earthquakes inhabited by these very strange animals that live only on chemical energy coming out of the ground
they dont need the sun at all
bl you see this white v shaped mark on the back of the shrimp
its actually a light sensing organ
its how they find the hydrothermal vents
the vents are emitting a black body radiation an ir signature and so theyre able to find these vents at considerable distances
dg all this stuff is happening along that mile long mountain range that were calling the ribbon of life because just even today as we speak theres life being generated there from volcanic activity
this is the first time weve ever tried this any place
were going to try to show you high definition from the pacific
were moving up one of these pillars
this ones several stories tall
in it youll see that its a habitat for a lot of different animals
theres a funny kind of hot plate here with vent water coming out of it
so all of these are individual homes for worms
now heres a closer view of that community
heres crabs here worms here
there are smaller animals crawling around
heres pagoda structures
i think this is the neatest looking thing
i just cant get over this that youve got these little chimneys sitting here smoking away
this stuff is toxic as hell by the way
you could never get a permit to dump this in the ocean and its coming out all from it
its unbelievable its basically sulfuric acid and its being just dumped out at incredible rates
and animals are thriving and we probably came from here
thats probably where we evolved from
bl this bacteria that weve been talking about turns out to be the most simplest form of life found
there are a number of groups that are proposing that life evolved at these vent sites
although the vent sites are short lived an individual site may last only years or so as an ecosystem theyve been stable for millions well billions of years
dg it works too well you see therere some fish inside here as well
theres a fish sitting here
heres a crab with his claw right at the end of that tube worm waiting for that worm to stick his head out
bl the biologists right now cannot explain why these animals are so active
the worms are growing inches per week
dg i already said that this site from a human perspective is toxic as hell
not only that but on top the lifeblood that plumbing system turns off every year or so
their plumbing system turns off so the sites have to move
and then theres earthquakes and then volcanic eruptions on the order of one every five years that completely wipes the area out
despite that these animals grow back in about a years time
youre talking about biodensities and biodiversity again higher than the rainforest that just springs back to life
is it sensitive yes
is it fragile no its not really very fragile
ill end up with saying one thing
theres a story in the sea in the waters of the sea in the sediments and the rocks of the sea floor
its an incredible story
what we see when we look back in time in those sediments and rocks is a record of earth history
everything on this planet everything works by cycles and rhythms
the continents move apart they come back together
oceans come and go mountains come and go glaciers come and go
el nino comes and goes its not a disaster its rhythmic
what were learning now its almost like a symphony
its just like music it really is just like music
and what were learning now is that you cant listen to a five billion year long symphony get to today and say stop we want tomorrows note to be the same as it was today
its absurd its just absurd
so what weve got to learn now is to find out where this planets going at all these different scales and work with it
learn to manage it
the concept of preservation is futile
conservations tougher but we can probably get there
thank you very much
thank you

title steve keil a manifesto for play for bulgaria and beyond title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript steve keil fights the serious meme that has infected his home of bulgaria and calls for a return to play to revitalize the economy education and society a sparkling talk with a universal message for people everywhere who are reinventing their workplaces schools lives description
im here today to start a revolution
now before you get up in arms or you break into song or you pick a favorite color i want to define what i mean by revolution
by revolution i mean a drastic and far reaching change in the way we think and behave the way we think and the way we behave
now why steve why do we need a revolution
we need a revolution because things arent working theyre just not working
and that makes me really sad because im sick and tired of things not working
you know im sick and tired of us not living up to our potential
im sick and tired of us being last
and we are last place in so many things for example social factors
were last place in europe in innovation
there we are right at the end right at the bottom last place as a culture that doesnt value innovation
were last place in health care and thats important for a sense of well being
and there we are not just last in the e u were last in europe at the very bottom
and worst of all it just came out three weeks ago many of you have seen it the economist
were the saddest place on earth relative to gdp per capita the saddest place on earth
thats social lets look at education
where do we rank three weeks ago in another report by the oecd
last in reading math and science last
business the lowest perception in the e u
that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society
why as a result what happens
the lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses
and this is despite the fact that everybody knows that small business is the engine of economies
we hire the most people we create the most taxes
so if our engines broken guess what
last in europe gdp per capita
last
so its no surprise guys that percent of bulgarians are not optimistic about the future
were unhappy we have bad education and we have the worst businesses
and these are facts guys
this isnt story tale its not make believe
its not
its not a conspiracy i have got against bulgaria these are facts
so i think it should be really really clear that our system is broken
the way we think the way we behave our operating system of behaving is broken
we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave to transform bulgaria for the better for ourselves for our friends for our family and for our future
how did this happen
lets be positive now were going to get positive how did this happen
i think were last because and this is going to be drastic to some of you because we are handicapping ourselves
were holding ourselves back because we dont value play
i said play all right
in case some of you forgot what play is this is what play looks like
babies play kids play adults play
we dont value play
in fact we devalue play
and we devalue it in three areas
lets go back to the same three areas
social years of what
of communism of valuing the society and the state over the individual and squashing inadvertently creativity individual self expression and innovation
and instead what do we value
because its shown the way we apply generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context which told us what in communism
to be serious
to be really really serious
it did
be serious
i cant tell you how many times ive been scolded in the park for letting my kids play on the ground
heaven forbid they play in the dirt the kal or even worse lokvi water that will kill them
i have been told by babas and dyados that we shouldnt let our kids play so much because life is serious and we need to train them for the seriousness of life
we have a serious meme running through
its a social gene running through us
its a serious gene
its years of it thats created what i call the baba factor
and heres how it works
step one woman says i want to have a baby iskam baby
step two we get the baby woohoo
but then what happens in step three
i want to go back to work because i need to further my career or i just want to go have coffees
im going to give bebko to baba
but we need to remember that babas been infected by the serious meme for years
so what happens
she passes that virus on to baby and it takes a really really really long time as the redwood trees for that serious meme to get out of our operating system
what happens then
it goes into education where we have an antiquated education system that has little changed for years that values rote learning memorization and standardization and devalues self expression self exploration questioning creativity and play
its a crap system
true story i went looking for a school for my kid
we went to this prestigious little school and they say theyre going to study math times a week and science eight times a week and reading five times a day and all this stuff
and we said well what about play and recess
and they said ha there wont be a single moment in the schedule
and we said hes five
what a crime what a crime
and its a crime that our education system is so serious because education is serious that were creating mindless robotic workers to put bolts in pre drilled holes
but im sorry the problems of today are not the problems of the industrial revolution
we need adaptability the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative
we dont need mechanized workers
but no now our meme goes into work where we dont value play
we create robotic workers that we treat like assets to lever and just throw away
what are qualities of a bulgarian work
autocratic do what i say because im the chef
im the boss and i know better than you
untrusting youre obviously a criminal so im going to install cameras
controlling youre obviously an idiot so im going to make a zillion little processes for you to follow so you dont step out of the box
so theyre restrictive dont use your mobile phone dont use your laptop dont search the internet dont be on i m
thats somehow unprofessional and bad
and at the end of the day its unfulfilling because youre controlled youre restricted youre not valued and youre not having any fun
in social in education and in our business dont value play
and thats why were last because we dont value play
and you can say thats ridiculous steve what a dumb idea
it cant be because of play
just play thats a stupid thing
we have the serious meme in us
well im going to say no
and i will prove it to you in the next part of the speech that play is the catalyst it is the revolution that we can use to transform bulgaria for the better
play our brains are hardwired for play
evolution has selected over millions and billions of years for play in animals and in humans
and you know what
evolution does a really really good job of deselecting traits that arent advantageous to us and selecting traits for competitive advantage
nature isnt stupid and it selected for play
throughout the animal kingdom for example ants ants play
maybe you didnt know that
but when theyre playing theyre learning the social order and dynamics of things
rats play but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger brains and they learn tasks better skills
kittens play we all know kittens play
but what you may not know is that kittens deprived of play are unable to interact socially
they can still hunt but they cant be social
bears play
but what you may not know is that bears that play more survive longer
its not the bears that learn how to fish better
its the ones that play more
and a final really interesting study its been shown a correlation between play and brain size
the more you play the bigger the brains there are
dolphins pretty big brains play a lot
but who do you think with the biggest brains are the biggest players
yours truly humans
kids play we play of every nationality of every race of every color of every religion
its a universal thing we play
and its not just kids its adults too
really cool term neoteny the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults
and who are the biggest neotenists
humans we play sports
we do it for fun or as olympians or as professionals
we play musical instruments
we dance we kiss we sing we just goof around
were designed by nature to play from birth to old age
were designed to do that continuously to play and play a lot and not stop playing
it is a huge benefit
just like theres benefits to animals theres benefits to humans
for example its been shown to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala in the area where it controls emotions
its been shown to promote pre frontal cortex development where a lot of cognition is happening
as a result what happens
we develop more emotional maturity if we play more
we develop better decision making ability if we play more
these guys are facts
its not fiction its not story tales its not make believe its cold hard science
these are the benefits to play
it is a genetic birthright that we have like walking or speaking or seeing
and if we handicap ourselves with play we handicap ourselves as if we would with any other birthright that we have
we hold ourselves back
little exercise just for a second close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play
imagine a world without theater without the arts without song without dancing without soccer without football without laughter
what does this world look like
its pretty bleak
its pretty glum
now imagine your workplace
is it fun is it playful
or maybe the workplace of your friends here were forward thinking
is it fun is it playful
or is it crap is it autocratic controlling restrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling
we have this concept that the opposite of play is work
we even feel guilty if were seen playing at work
oh my colleagues see me laughing i must not have enough work or oh ive got to hide because my boss might see me
hes going to think im not working hard
but i have news for you our thinking is backwards
the opposite of play is not work
the opposite of play is depression its depression
in fact play improves our work
just like theres benefits for humans and animals theres benefits for play at work
for example it stimulates creativity
it increases our openness to change
it improves our ability to learn
it provides a sense of purpose and mastery two key motivational things that increase productivity through play
so before you start thinking of play as just not serious play doesnt mean frivolous
you know the professional athlete that loves skiing hes serious about it but he loves it
hes having fun hes in the groove hes in the flow
a doctor might be serious but laughters still a great medicine
our thinking is backwards
we shouldnt be feeling guilty
we should be celebrating play
quick example from the corporate world
fedex easy motto people service profit
if you treat your people like people if you treat them great theyre happier theyre fulfilled they have a sense of mastery and purpose
what happens they give better service not worse but better
and when customers call for service and theyre dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled how do the customers feel they feel great
and what do great customers do great feeling customers
they buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends which leads to more profit
people service profit
play increases productivity not decreases
and youre going to say gee that can work for fedex out there in the united states but it cant work in bulgaria
no way were different
it does work in bulgaria you guys two reasons
one play is universal
theres nothing weird about bulgarians that we cant play besides the serious meme that we have to kick out
two ive tried it ive tried at sciant
when i got there we had zero happy customers
not one customer would refer us
i asked them all
we had marginal profit i did
we had marginal profits and we had unhappy stakeholders
through some basic change change like improving transparency change like promoting self direction and collaboration encouraging collaboration not autocracy the things like having a results focus
i dont care when you get in in the morning i dont care when you leave
i care that your customer and your team is happy and youre organized with that
why do i care if you get in at nine oclock
basically promoting fun
through promoting fun and a great environment we were able to transform sciant and in just three short years sounds like a long time but change is slow every customer from zero to every customer referring us above average profits for the industry and happy stakeholders
and you can say well how do you know theyre happy
well we did win every year that we entered one of the rankings for best employer for small business
independent analysis from anonymous employees on their surveys
it does and it can work in bulgaria
theres nothing holding us back except our own mentality about play
so some steps that we can take to finish up how to make this revolution through play
first of all you have to believe me
if you dont believe me well just go home and think about it some more or something
second of all if you dont have the feeling of play in you you need to rediscover play
whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy that you enjoyed only six months ago but now that youve got that promotion you cant enjoy because you feel like you have to be serious rediscover it
i dont care if its mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game
rediscover that because youre the leaders the innovation leaders the thought leaders
youre the ones that have to go back to the office or talk to your friends and ignite the fire of change in the play revolution
you guys have to and if youre not feeling it your colleagues your employees arent going to feel it
youve got to go back and say hey im going to trust you
weird concept i hired you i should trust you
im going to let you make decisions im going to empower you and im going to delegate to the lowest level rather than the top
im going to encourage constructive criticism
im going to let you challenge authority
because its by challenging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the rut that were in and create innovative solutions to problems of today
were not always right as leaders
were going to eradicate fear
fear is the enemy of play
and were going to do things like eliminate restrictions
you know what let them use their mobile phone for personal calls heaven forbid
let them be on the internet
let them be on instant messengers
let them take long lunches
lunch is like the recess for work
its when you go out in the world and you recharge your brain you meet your friends you have a beer you have some food you talk you get some synergy of ideas that maybe you wouldnt have had before
let them do it give them some freedom and in general let them play let them have fun at the workplace
we spend so much of our lives at the workplace and its supposed to be what a miserable grind so that years from now we wake up and say is this it
is that all there was
unacceptable nepriemliv
so in summary we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave but we dont need a workers revolution
we dont need a workers revolution
what we need is a players uprising
what we need is a players uprising
what we need is a players uprising
seriously we need to band together
today is the start of the uprising
but what you need to do is fan the flames of the revolution
you need to go and share your ideas and your success stories of what worked about reinvigorating our lives our schools and our work with play about how play promotes a sense of promise and self fulfillment of how play promotes innovation and productivity and ultimately how play creates meaning
because we cant do it alone we have to do it together and together if we do this and share these ideas on play we can transform bulgaria for the better
thank you

title andreas schleicher use data to build better schools title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript how can we measure what makes a school system work andreas schleicher walks us through the pisa test a global measurement that ranks countries against one another then uses that same data to help schools improve watch to find out where your country stacks up and learn the single factor that makes some systems outperform others description
radical openness is still a distant future in the field of school education
we have such a hard time figuring out that learning is not a place but an activity
but i want to tell you the story of pisa oecds test to measure the knowledge and skills of year olds around the world and its really a story of how international comparisons have globalized the field of education that we usually treat as an affair of domestic policy
look at how the world looked in the in terms of the proportion of people who had completed high school
you can see the united states ahead of everyone else and much of the economic success of the united states draws on its long standing advantage as the first mover in education
but in the some countries caught up
in the the global expansion of the talent pool continued
and the world didnt stop in the
so in the the u s was first
in the it was and not because standards had fallen but because they had risen so much faster elsewhere
korea shows you whats possible in education
two generations ago korea had the standard of living of afghanistan today and was one of the lowest education performers
today every young korean finishes high school
so this tells us that in a global economy it is no longer national improvement thats the benchmark for success but the best performing education systems internationally
the trouble is that measuring how much time people spend in school or what degree they have got is not always a good way of seeing what they can actually do
look at the toxic mix of unemployed graduates on our streets while employers say they cannot find the people with the skills they need
and that tells you that better degrees dont automatically translate into better skills and better jobs and better lives
so with pisa we try to change this by measuring the knowledge and skills of people directly
and we took a very special angle to this
we were less interested in whether students can simply reproduce what they have learned in school but we wanted to test whether they can extrapolate from what they know and apply their knowledge in novel situations
now some people have criticized us for this
they say you know such a way of measuring outcomes is terribly unfair to people because we test students with problems they havent seen before
but if you take that logic you know you should consider life unfair because the test of truth in life is not whether we can remember what we learned in school but whether we are prepared for change whether we are prepared for jobs that havent been created to use technologies that havent been invented to solve problems we just cant anticipate today
and once hotly contested our way of measuring outcomes has actually quickly become the standard
in our latest assessment in we measured school systems that together cover percent of the economy
this chart shows you the performance of countries
in red sort of below oecd average
yellow is so so and in green are the countries doing really well
you can see shanghai korea singapore in asia finland in europe canada in north america doing really well
you can also see that there is a gap of almost three and a half school years between year olds in shanghai and year olds in chile and the gap grows to seven school years when you include the countries with really poor performance
theres a world of difference in the way in which young people are prepared for todays economy
but i want to introduce a second important dimension into this picture
educators like to talk about equity
with pisa we wanted to measure how they actually deliver equity in terms of ensuring that people from different social backgrounds have equal chances
and we see that in some countries the impact of social background on learning outcomes is very very strong
opportunities are unequally distributed
a lot of potential of young children is wasted
we see in other countries that it matters much less into which social context youre born
we all want to be there in the upper right quadrant where performance is strong and learning opportunities are equally distributed
nobody and no country can afford to be there where performance is poor and there are large social disparities
and then we can debate you know is it better to be there where performance is strong at the price of large disparities
or do we want to focus on equity and accept mediocrity
but actually if you look at how countries come out on this picture you see there are a lot of countries that actually are combining excellence with equity
in fact one of the most important lessons from this comparison is that you dont have to compromise equity to achieve excellence
these countries have moved on from providing excellence for just some to providing excellence for all a very important lesson
and that also challenges the paradigms of many school systems that believe they are mainly there to sort people
and ever since those results came out policymakers educators researchers from around the world have tried to figure out whats behind the success of those systems
but lets step back for a moment and focus on the countries that actually started pisa and im giving them a colored bubble now
and im making the size of the bubble proportional to the amount of money that countries spent on students
if money would tell you everything about the quality of learning outcomes you would find all the large bubbles at the top no
but thats not what you see
spending per student only explains about well less than percent of the performance variation among countries and luxembourg for example the most expensive system doesnt do particularly well
what you see is that two countries with similar spending achieve very different results
you also see and i think thats one of the most encouraging findings that we no longer live in a world that is neatly divided between rich and well educated countries and poor and badly educated ones a very very important lesson
lets look at this in greater detail
the red dot shows you spending per student relative to a countrys wealth
one way you can spend money is by paying teachers well and you can see korea investing a lot in attracting the best people into the teaching profession
and korea also invests into long school days which drives up costs further
last but not least koreans want their teachers not only to teach but also to develop
they invest in professional development and collaboration and many other things
all that costs money
how can korea afford all of this
the answer is students in korea learn in large classes
this is the blue bar which is driving costs down
you go to the next country on the list luxembourg and you can see the red dot is exactly where it is for korea so luxembourg spends the same per student as korea does
but you know parents and teachers and policymakers in luxembourg all like small classes
you know its very pleasant to walk into a small class
so they have invested all their money into there and the blue bar class size is driving costs up
but even luxembourg can spend its money only once and the price for this is that teachers are not paid particularly well
students dont have long hours of learning
and basically teachers have little time to do anything else than teaching
so you can see two countries spent their money very differently and actually how they spent their money matters a lot more than how much they invest in education
lets go back to the year
remember that was the year before the ipod was invented
this is how the world looked then in terms of pisa performance
the first thing you can see is that the bubbles were a lot smaller no
we spent a lot less on education about percent less on education
so you ask yourself if education has become so much more expensive has it become so much better
and the bitter truth really is that you know not in many countries
but there are some countries which have seen impressive improvements
germany my own country in the year featured in the lower quadrant below average performance large social disparities
and remember germany we used to be one of those countries that comes out very well when you just count people who have degrees
very disappointing results
people were stunned by the results
and for the very first time the public debate in germany was dominated for months by education not tax not other kinds of issues but education was the center of the public debate
and then policymakers began to respond to this
the federal government dramatically raised its investment in education
a lot was done to increase the life chances of students with an immigrant background or from social disadvantage
and whats really interesting is that this wasnt just about optimizing existing policies but data transformed some of the beliefs and paradigms underlying german education
for example traditionally the education of the very young children was seen as the business of families and you would have cases where women were seen as neglecting their family responsibilities when they sent their children to kindergarten
pisa has transformed that debate and pushed early childhood education right at the center of public policy in germany
or traditionally the german education divides children at the age of very young children between those deemed to pursue careers of knowledge workers and those who would end up working for the knowledge workers and that mainly along socioeconomic lines and that paradigm is being challenged now too
a lot of change
and the good news is nine years later you can see improvements in quality and equity
people have taken up the challenge done something about it
or take korea at the other end of the spectrum
in the year korea did already very well but the koreans were concerned that only a small share of their students achieved the really high levels of excellence
they took up the challenge and korea was able to double the proportion of students achieving excellence in one decade in the field of reading
well if you only focus on your brightest students you know what happens is disparities grow and you can see this bubble moving slightly to the other direction but still an impressive improvement
a major overhaul of polands education helped to dramatically reduce between variability among schools turn around many of the lowest performing schools and raise performance by over half a school year
and you can see other countries as well
portugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system raise quality and improve equity and so did hungary
so what you can actually see theres been a lot of change
and even those people who complain and say that the relative standing of countries on something like pisa is just an artifact of culture of economic factors of social issues of homogeneity of societies and so on these people must now concede that education improvement is possible
you know poland hasnt changed its culture
it didnt change its economy it didnt change the compositions of its population
it didnt fire its teachers it changed its education policies and practice very impressive
and all that raises of course the question what can we learn from those countries in the green quadrant who have achieved high levels of equity high levels of performance and raised outcomes
and of course the question is can what works in one context provide a model elsewhere
of course you cant copy and paste education systems wholesale but these comparisons have identified a range of factors that high performing systems share
everybody agrees that education is important
everybody says that
but the test of truth is how do you weigh that priority against other priorities
how do countries pay their teachers relative to other highly skilled workers
would you want your child to become a teacher rather than a lawyer
how do the media talk about schools and teachers
those are the critical questions and what we have learned from pisa is that in high performing education systems the leaders have convinced their citizens to make choices that value education their future more than consumption today
and you know whats interesting you wont believe it but there are countries in which the most attractive place to be is not the shopping center but the school
those things really exist
but placing a high value on education is just part of the picture
the other part is the belief that all children are capable of success
you have some countries where students are segregated early in their ages
you know students are divided up reflecting the belief that only some children can achieve world class standards
but usually that is linked to very strong social disparities
if you go to japan in asia or finland in europe parents and teachers in those countries expect every student to succeed and you can see that actually mirrored in student behavior
when we asked students what counts for success in mathematics students in north america would typically tell us you know its all about talent
if im not born as a genius in math id better study something else
nine out of japanese students say that it depends on my own investment on my own effort and that tells you a lot about the system that is around them
in the past different students were taught in similar ways
high performers on pisa embrace diversity with differentiated pedagogical practices
they realize that ordinary students have extraordinary talents and they personalize learning opportunities
high performing systems also share clear and ambitious standards across the entire spectrum
every student knows what matters
every student knows whats required to be successful
and nowhere does the quality of an education system exceed the quality of its teachers
high performing systems are very careful in how they recruit and select their teachers and how they train them
they watch how they improve the performances of teachers in difficulties who are struggling and how they structure teacher pay
they provide an environment also in which teachers work together to frame good practice
and they provide intelligent pathways for teachers to grow in their careers
in bureaucratic school systems teachers are often left alone in classrooms with a lot of prescription on what they should be teaching
high performing systems are very clear what good performance is
they set very ambitious standards but then they enable their teachers to figure out what do i need to teach to my students today
the past was about delivered wisdom in education
now the challenge is to enable user generated wisdom
high performers have moved on from professional or from administrative forms of accountability and control sort of how do you check whether people do what theyre supposed to do in education to professional forms of work organization
they enable their teachers to make innovations in pedagogy
they provide them with the kind of development they need to develop stronger pedagogical practices
the goal of the past was standardization and compliance
high performing systems have made teachers and school principals inventive
in the past the policy focus was on outcomes on provision
the high performing systems have helped teachers and school principals to look outwards to the next teacher the next school around their lives
and the most impressive outcomes of world class systems is that they achieve high performance across the entire system
youve seen finland doing so well on pisa but what makes finland so impressive is that only five percent of the performance variation amongst students lies between schools
every school succeeds
this is where success is systemic
and how do they do that
they invest resources where they can make the most difference
they attract the strongest principals into the toughest schools and the most talented teachers into the most challenging classroom
last but not least those countries align policies across all areas of public policy
they make them coherent over sustained periods of time and they ensure that what they do is consistently implemented
now knowing what successful systems are doing doesnt yet tell us how to improve
thats also clear and thats where some of the limits of international comparisons of pisa are
thats where other forms of research need to kick in and thats also why pisa doesnt venture into telling countries what they should be doing
but its strength lies in telling them what everybody else has been doing
and the example of pisa shows that data can be more powerful than administrative control of financial subsidy through which we usually run education systems
you know some people argue that changing educational administration is like moving graveyards
you just cant rely on the people out there to help you with this
but pisa has shown whats possible in education
it has helped countries to see that improvement is possible
it has taken away excuses from those who are complacent
and it has helped countries to set meaningful targets in terms of measurable goals achieved by the worlds leaders
if we can help every child every teacher every school every principal every parent see what improvement is possible that only the sky is the limit to education improvement we have laid the foundations for better policies and better lives

title rachel pike the science behind a climate headline title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript in minutes atmospheric chemist rachel pike provides a glimpse of the massive scientific effort behind the bold headlines on climate change with her team one of thousands who contributed taking a risky flight over the rainforest in pursuit of data on a key molecule description
id like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper
headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog
they are both two branches of the same field of atmospheric science
recently the headlines looked like this when the intergovernmental panel on climate change or ipcc put out their report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system
that report was written by scientists from countries
they wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic
and all of those pages were reviewed by another plus scientists and reviewers from countries
its a big community its such a big community in fact that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world
over scientists go to san francisco every year for that
and every one of those scientists is in a research group and every research group studies a wide variety of topics
for us at cambridge its as varied as the el niño oscillation which affects weather and climate to the assimilation of satellite data to emissions from crops that produce biofuels which is what i happen to study
and in each one of these research areas of which there are even more there are phd students like me and we study incredibly narrow topics things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules
and one of the molecules i study is called isoprene which is here its a small organic molecule youve probably never heard of it
the weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to zeta illion to the molecules of isoprene
but despite its very small weight enough of it is emitted into the atmosphere every year to equal the weight of all the people on the planet
its a huge amount of stuff its equal to the weight of methane
and because its so much stuff its really important for the atmospheric system
because its important to the atmospheric system we go to all lengths to study this thing
we blow it up and look at the pieces
this is the euphore smog chamber in spain
atmospheric explosions or full combustion takes about times longer than what happens in your car
but still we look at the pieces
we run enormous models on supercomputers this is what i happen to do
our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each on minute timescales
and it takes weeks to perform our integrations
and we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand whats happening
we also fly all over the world looking for this thing
i recently joined a field campaign in malaysia there are others
we found a global atmospheric watchtower there in the middle of the rainforest and hung hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of scientific equipment off this tower to look for isoprene and of course other things while we were there
this is the tower in the middle of the rainforest from above
and this is the tower from below
and on part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us
and this plane the model which was run by faam normally flies to people
so maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today
but we didnt just fly it we were flying at meters above the top of the canopy to measure this molecule incredibly dangerous stuff
we have to fly at a special incline in order to make the measurements
we hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering
we have to get special flight clearance
and as you come around the banks in these valleys the forces can get up to two gs
and the scientists have to be completely harnessed in in order to make measurements while theyre on board
so as you can imagine the inside of this aircraft doesnt look like any plane you would take on vacation
its a flying laboratory that we took to make measurements in the region of this molecule
we do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule
and when one student like me has some sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule they write one scientific paper on the subject
and out of that field campaign well probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules
and as a body of knowledge builds up it will form one subsection or one sub subsection of an assessment like the ipcc although we have others
and each one of the chapters of the ipcc has six to ten subsections
so you can imagine the scale of the effort
in each one of those assessments that we write we always tag on a summary and the summary is written for a non scientific audience
and we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers in order to make headlines like these
thank you very much

title christopher decharms a look inside the brain in real time title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript neuroscientist and inventor christopher decharms demonstrates a new way to use fmri to show brain activity thoughts emotions pain while it is happening in other words you can actually see how you feel description
hi im going to ask you to raise your arms and wave back just the way i am kind of a royal wave
you can mimic what you can see
you can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm
soon youll be able to look inside your brain and program control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there
im going to tell you about that technology
people have wanted to look inside the human mind the human brain for thousands of years
well coming out of the research labs just now for our generation is the possibility to do that
people envision this as being very difficult
you had to take a spaceship shrink it down inject it into the bloodstream
it was terribly dangerous
you could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries
but now we have a real technology to do this
were going to fly into my colleague peters brain
were going to do it non invasively using mri
we dont have to inject anything we dont need radiation
we will be able to fly into the anatomy of peters brain literally fly into his body but more importantly we can look into his mind
when peter moves his arm that yellow spot you see there is the interface to the functioning of peters mind taking place
now youve seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains
whats new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis
weve collapsed that through technology to milliseconds and that allows us to let peter to look at his brain in real time as hes inside the scanner
he can look at these points of activation per second
if he can see this pattern in his own brain he can learn how to control it
there have been three ways to try to impact the brain the therapists couch pills and the knife
this is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have
we all know that as we form thoughts they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains
chronic pain is an example if you burn yourself you pull your hand away
but if youre still in pain in six months or six years time its because these circuits are producing pain thats no longer helping you
if we can look at the activation in the brain thats producing the pain we can form models and watch in real time the brain process information and then we can select the areas that produce the pain
so put your arms back up and flex your bicep
now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain and select brain areas to do that same thing
what youre seeing here is weve selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient
this may shock you but were literally reading this persons brain in real time
theyre watching their own brain activation and theyre controlling the pathway that produces their pain
theyre learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates
as they do it in the upper left is a display thats yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled
when they control their brain they can control their pain
this is an investigational technology but in clinical trials were seeing a to percent decrease in chronic pain patients
this is not the matrix you can only do this to yourself you take control
ive seen inside my brain you will too soon
when you do what do you want to control
you will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself all your experiences
these are some of the areas were working on today that i dont have time to go into in detail
but i want to leave with you the big question
we are the first generation thats going to be able to enter into using this technology the human mind and brain
where will we take it

title beeban kidron the shared wonder of film title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript movies have the power to create a shared narrative experience and to shape memories and worldviews british film director beeban kidron invokes iconic film scenes from miracle in milan to boyz n the hood as she shows how her group filmclub shares great films with kids description
evidence suggests that humans in all ages and from all cultures create their identity in some kind of narrative form
from mother to daughter preacher to congregant teacher to pupil storyteller to audience
whether in cave paintings or the latest uses of the internet human beings have always told their histories and truths through parable and fable
we are inveterate storytellers
but where in our increasingly secular and fragmented world do we offer communality of experience unmediated by our own furious consumerism
and what narrative what history what identity what moral code are we imparting to our young
cinema is arguably the centurys most influential art form
its artists told stories across national boundaries in as many languages genres and philosophies as one can imagine
indeed it is hard to find a subject that film has yet to tackle
during the last decade weve seen a vast integration of global media now dominated by a culture of the hollywood blockbuster
we are increasingly offered a diet in which sensation not story is king
what was common to us all years ago the telling of stories between generations is now rarified
as a filmmaker it worried me
as a human being it puts the fear of god in me
what future could the young build with so little grasp of where theyve come from and so few narratives of whats possible
the irony is palpable technical access has never been greater cultural access never weaker
and so in we set up filmclub an organization that ran weekly film screenings in schools followed by discussions
if we could raid the annals of years of film maybe we could build a narrative that would deliver meaning to the fragmented and restless world of the young
given the access to technology even a school in a tiny rural hamlet could project a dvd onto a white board
in the first nine months we ran clubs across the u k with kids in age groups between five and watching a film uninterrupted for minutes
the films were curated and contextualized
but the choice was theirs and our audience quickly grew to choose the richest and most varied diet that we could provide
the outcome immediate
it was an education of the most profound and transformative kind
in groups as large as and as small as three these young people discovered new places new thoughts new perspectives
by the time the pilot had finished we had the names of a thousand schools that wished to join
the film that changed my life is a film by vittorio de sica miracle in milan
its a remarkable comment on slums poverty and aspiration
i had seen the film on the occasion of my fathers birthday
technology then meant we had to hire a viewing cinema find and pay for the print and the projectionist
but for my father the emotional and artistic importance of de sicas vision was so great that he chose to celebrate his half century with his three teenage children and of their friends in order he said to pass the baton of concern and hope on to the next generation
in the last shot of miracle in milan slum dwellers float skyward on flying brooms
sixty years after the film was made and years after i first saw it i see young faces tilt up in awe their incredulity matching mine
and the speed with which they associate it with slumdog millionaire or the favelas in rio speaks to the enduring nature
in a filmclub season about democracy and government we screened mr smith goes to washington
made in the film is older than most of our members grandparents
frank capras classic values independence and propriety
it shows how to do right how to be heroically awkward
it is also an expression of faith in the political machine as a force of honor
shortly after mr smith became a filmclub classic there was a week of all night filibustering in the house of lords
and it was with great delight that we found young people up and down the country explaining with authority what filibustering was and why the lords might defy their bedtime on a point of principle
after all jimmy stewart filibustered for two entire reels
in choosing hotel rwanda they explored genocide of the most brutal kind
it provoked tears as well as incisive questions about unarmed peace keeping forces and the double dealing of a western society that picks its moral fights with commodities in mind
and when schindlers list demanded that they never forget one child full of the pain of consciousness remarked we already forgot otherwise how did hotel rwanda happen
as they watch more films their lives got palpably richer
pickpocket started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement
to sir with love ignited its teen audience
they celebrated a change in attitude towards non white britons but railed against our restless school system that does not value collective identity unlike that offered by sidney poitiers careful tutelage
by now these thoughtful opinionated curious young people thought nothing of tackling films of all forms black and white subtitled documentary non narrative fantasy and thought nothing of writing detailed reviews that competed to favor one film over another in passionate and increasingly sophisticated prose
six thousand reviews each school week vying for the honor of being review of the week
from clubs we became hundreds then thousands until we were nearly a quarter of a million kids in clubs right across the country
and although the numbers were and continue to be extraordinary what became more extraordinary was how the experience of critical and curious questioning translated into life
some of our kids started talking with their parents others with their teachers or with their friends
and those without friends started making them
the films provided communality across all manner of divide
and the stories they held provided a shared experience
persepolis brought a daughter closer to her iranian mother and jaws became the way in which one young boy was able to articulate the fear hed experienced in flight from violence that killed first his father then his mother the latter thrown overboard on a boat journey
who was right who wrong
what would they do under the same conditions
was the tale told well
was there a hidden message
how has the world changed how could it be different
a tsunami of questions flew out of the mouths of children who the world didnt think were interested
and they themselves had not known they cared
and as they wrote and debated rather than seeing the films as artifacts they began to see themselves
i have an aunt who is a wonderful storyteller
in a moment she can invoke images of running barefoot on table mountain and playing cops and robbers
quite recently she told me that in two of her sisters and my father traveled on a boat to israel without my grandparents
when the sailors mutinied at sea in a demand for humane conditions it was these teenagers that fed the crew
i was past when my father died
he never mentioned that journey
my mothers mother left europe in a hurry without her husband but with her three year old daughter and diamonds sewn into the hem of her skirt
after two years in hiding my grandfather appeared in london
he was never right again
and his story was hushed as he assimilated
my story started in england with a clean slate and the silence of immigrant parents
i had anne frank the great escape shoah triumph of the will
it was leni riefenstahl in her elegant nazi propaganda who gave context to what the family had to endure
these films held what was too hurtful to say out loud and they became more useful to me than the whispers of survivors and the occasional glimpse of a tattoo on a maiden aunts wrist
purists may feel that fiction dissipates the quest of real human understanding that film is too crude to tell a complex and detailed history or that filmmakers always serve drama over truth
but within the reels lie purpose and meaning
as one year old said after watching wizard of oz every person should watch this because unless you do you may not know that you too have a heart
we honor reading why not honor watching with the same passion
consider citizen kane as valuable as jane austen
agree that boyz n the hood like tennyson offers an emotional landscape and a heightened understanding that work together
each a piece of memorable art each a brick in the wall of who we are
and its okay if we remember tom hanks better than astronaut jim lovell or have ben kingsleys face superimposed onto that of gandhis
and though not real eve harrington howard beale mildred pierce are an opportunity to discover what it is to be human and no less helpful to understanding our life and times as shakespeare is in illuminating the world of elizabethan england
we guessed that film whose stories are a meeting place of drama music literature and human experience would engage and inspire the young people participating in filmclub
what we could not have foreseen was the measurable improvements in behavior confidence and academic achievement
once reluctant students now race to school talk to their teachers fight not on the playground but to choose next weeks film young people who have found self definition ambition and an appetite for education and social engagement from the stories they have witnessed
our members defy the binary description of how we so often describe our young
they are neither feral nor myopically self absorbed
they are like other young people negotiating a world with infinite choice but little culture of how to find meaningful experience
we appeared surprised at the behaviors of those who define themselves by the size of the tick on their shoes yet acquisition has been the narrative we have offered
if we want different values we have to tell a different story a story that understands that an individual narrative is an essential component of a persons identity that a collective narrative is an essential component of a cultural identity and without it it is impossible to imagine yourself as part of a group
because when these people get home after a screening of rear window and raise their gaze to the building next door they have the tools to wonder who apart from them is out there and what is their story

title ellen jorgensen biohacking you can do it too title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript we have personal computing why not personal biotech that s the question biologist ellen jorgensen and her colleagues asked themselves before opening genspace a nonprofit diy bio lab in brooklyn devoted to citizen science where amateurs can go and tinker with biotechnology far from being a sinister frankensteins lab genspace offers a long list of fun creative and practical uses for diy bio description
its a great time to be a molecular biologist
reading and writing dna code is getting easier and cheaper
by the end of this year well be able to sequence the three million bits of information in your genome in less than a day and for less than euros
biotech is probably the most powerful and the fastest growing technology sector
it has the power potentially to replace our fossil fuels to revolutionize medicine and to touch every aspect of our daily lives
so who gets to do it
i think wed all be pretty comfortable with this guy doing it
but what about that guy
in i first heard about diybio
its a movement that it advocates making biotechnology accessible to everyone not just scientists and people in government labs
the idea is that if you open up the science and you allow diverse groups to participate it could really stimulate innovation
putting technology in the hands of the end user is usually a good idea because theyve got the best idea of what their needs are
and heres this really sophisticated technology coming down the road all these associated social moral ethical questions and we scientists are just lousy at explaining to the public just exactly what it is were doing in those labs
so wouldnt it be nice if there was a place in your local neighborhood where you could go and learn about this stuff do it hands on
i thought so
so three years ago i got together with some friends of mine who had similar aspirations and we founded genspace
its a nonprofit a community biotech lab in brooklyn new york and the idea was people could come they could take classes and putter around in the lab in a very open friendly atmosphere
none of my previous experience prepared me for what came next can you guess
the press started calling us
and the more we talked about how great it was to increase science literacy the more they wanted to talk about us creating the next frankenstein and as a result for the next six months when you googled my name instead of getting my scientific papers you got this
it was pretty depressing
the only thing that got us through that period was that we knew that all over the world there were other people that were trying to do the same thing that we were
they were opening biohacker spaces and some of them were facing much greater challenges than we did more regulations less resources
but now three years later heres where we stand
its a vibrant global community of hackerspaces and this is just the beginning
these are some of the biggest ones and there are others opening every day
theres one probably going to open up in moscow one in south korea and the cool thing is they each have their own individual flavor that grew out of the community they came out of
let me take you on a little tour
biohackers work alone
we work in groups in big cities and in small villages
we reverse engineer lab equipment
we genetically engineer bacteria
we hack hardware software wetware and of course the code of life
we like to build things
then we like to take things apart
we make things grow
we make things glow
and we make cells dance
the spirit of these labs its open its positive but you know sometimes when people think of us the first thing that comes to mind is bio safety bio security all the dark side stuff
im not going to minimize those concerns
any powerful technology is inherently dual use and you know you get something like synthetic biology nanobiotechnology it really compels you you have to look at both the amateur groups but also the professional groups because they have better infrastructure they have better facilities and they have access to pathogens
so the united nations did just that and they recently issued a report on this whole area and what they concluded was the power of this technology for positive was much greater than the risk for negative and they even looked specifically at the diybio community and they noted not surprisingly that the press had a tendency to consistently overestimate our capabilities and underestimate our ethics
as a matter of fact diy people from all over the world america europe got together last year and we hammered out a common code of ethics
thats a lot more than conventional science has done
now we follow state and local regulations
we dispose of our waste properly we follow safety procedures we dont work with pathogens
you know if youre working with a pathogen youre not part of the biohacker community youre part of the bioterrorist community im sorry
and sometimes people ask me well what about an accident
well working with the safe organisms that we normally work with the chance of an accident happening with somebody accidentally creating like some sort of superbug thats literally about as probable as a snowstorm in the middle of the sahara desert
now it could happen but im not going to plan my life around it
ive actually chosen to take a different kind of risk
i signed up for something called the personal genome project
its a study at harvard where at the end of the study theyre going to take my entire genomic sequence all of my medical information and my identity and theyre going to post it online for everyone to see
there were a lot of risks involved that they talked about during the informed consent portion
the one i liked the best is someone could download my sequence go back to the lab synthesize some fake ellen dna and plant it at a crime scene
but like diybio the positive outcomes and the potential for good for a study like that far outweighs the risk
now you might be asking yourself well you know what would i do in a biolab
well it wasnt that long ago we were asking well what would anyone do with a personal computer
so this stuff is just beginning
were only seeing just the tip of the dna iceberg
let me show you what you could do right now
a biohacker in germany a journalist wanted to know whose dog was leaving little presents on his street
yep you guessed it he threw tennis balls to all the neighborhood dogs analyzed the saliva identified the dog and confronted the dog owner
i discovered an invasive species in my own backyard
looked like a ladybug right
it actually is a japanese beetle
and the same kind of technology its called dna barcoding its really cool you can use it to check if your caviar is really beluga if that sushi is really tuna or if that goat cheese that you paid so much for is really goats
in a biohacker space you can analyze your genome for mutations
you can analyze your breakfast cereal for gmos and you can explore your ancestry
you can send weather balloons up into the stratosphere collect microbes see whats up there
you can make a biocensor out of yeast to detect pollutants in water
you can make some sort of a biofuel cell
you can do a lot of things
you can also do an art science project some of these are really spectacular and they look at social ecological problems from a completely different perspective
its really cool
some people ask me well why am i involved
i could have a perfectly good career in mainstream science
the thing is theres something in these labs that they have to offer society that you cant find anywhere else
theres something sacred about a space where you can work on a project and you dont have to justify to anyone that its going to make a lot of money that its going to save mankind or even that its feasible
it just has to follow safety guidelines
if you had spaces like this all over the world it could really change the perception of whos allowed to do biotech
its spaces like these that spawned personal computing
why not personal biotech
if everyone in this room got involved who knows what we could do
this is such a new area and as we say back in brooklyn you aint seen nothin yet

description ted talk subtitles and transcript world champion whistler geert chatrou performs the whimsical eleonora by a honhoff and his own fête de la belle in a fascinating interlude he talks about what brought him to the craft description
thank you
thank you very much
that was whistling
im trying to do this in english
what is a chubby curly haired guy from holland why is he whistling
well actually ive whistling since the age of four about four
my dad was always whistling around the house and i just thought thats part of communication in my family
so i whistled along with him
and actually till i was i always annoyed and irritated people with whistling because to be honest my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior
i whistled alone i whistled in the classroom
i whistled on bike i whistled everywhere
and i also whistled at a christmas eve party with my family in law
and they had some in my opinion terrible christmas music
and when i hear music that i dont like i try to make it better
so rudolph the red nosed reindeer you know it
but it can also sound like this
but during a christmas party at dinner actually its very annoying
so my sister in law asked me a few times please stop whistling
and i just couldnt
and at one point and i had some wine i have to admit that at one point i said if there was a contest i would join
and two weeks later i received a text message youre going to america
so okay im going to america
i would love to but why
so i immediately called her up of course
she googled and she found this world whistling championship in america of course
she didnt expect me to go there
and i would have lost my face
i dont know if thats correct english
but the dutch people here will understand what i mean
i lost my face
and she thought he will never go there
but actually i did
so i went to louisburg north carolina southeast united states and i entered the world of whistling
and i also entered the world championship and i won there in
that was great fun of course
and to defend my title like judokas do and sportsmen i thought well lets go back in and i won again
then i couldnt participate for a few years
and in i entered again in japan tokyo and i won again
so what happened now is im standing here in rotterdam in the beautiful city on a big stage and im talking about whistling
and actually i earn my money whistling at the moment
so i quit my day job as a nurse
and i try to live my dream well actually it was never my dream but it sounds so good
okay im not the only one whistling here
you say huh what do you mean
well actually you are going to whistle along
and then always the same thing happens people are watching each other and think oh my god
why can i go away
no you cant
actually its very simple
the track that i will whistle is called fête de la belle
its about minutes long
no no no its four minutes long
and i want to first rehearse with you your whistling
so i whistle the tone
sorry i forgot one thing
you whistle the same tone as me
i heard a wide variety of tones
this is very promising
this is very promising
ill ask the technicians to start the music
and if its started i just point where you whistle along and we will see what happens
oh hah
im so sorry technicians
im so used to that
i start it myself
okay here it is
okay
its easy isnt it
now comes the solo i propose i do that myself

title mark shaw one very dry demo title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript mark shaw demos ultra ever dry a liquid repellent coating that acts as an astonishingly powerful shield against water and water based materials at the nano level the spray covers a surface with an umbrella of air so that water bounces right off watch for an exciting two minute kicker description
im here to show you how something you cant see can be so much fun to look at
youre about to experience a new available and exciting technology thats going to make us rethink how we waterproof our lives
what i have here is a cinder block that weve coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material
its called ultra ever dry and when you apply it to any material it turns into a superhydrophobic shield
so this is a cinder block uncoated and you can see that its porous it absorbs water
not anymore
porous nonporous
so whats superhydrophobic
superhydrophobic is how we measure a drop of water on a surface
the rounder it is the more hydrophobic it is and if its really round its superhydrophobic
a freshly waxed car the water molecules slump to about degrees
a windshield coating is going to give you about degrees
but what youre seeing here is to degrees and anything over is superhydrophobic
so as part of the demonstration what i have is a pair of gloves and weve coated one of the gloves with the nanotechnology coating and lets see if you can tell which one and ill give you a hint
did you guess the one that was dry
when you have nanotechnology and nanoscience whats occurred is that were able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits
and were talking really small here
the way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers and one nanometer is a billionth of a meter and to put some scale to that if you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick and you put it side by side and you had of them youd be the width of a human hair
so very small but very useful
and its not just water that this works with
its a lot of water based materials like concrete water based paint mud and also some refined oils as well
you can see the difference
moving onto the next demonstration weve taken a pane of glass and weve coated the outside of it weve framed it with the nanotechnology coating and were going to pour this green tinted water inside the middle and youre going to see its going to spread out on glass like youd normally think it would except when it hits the coating it stops and i cant even coax it to leave
its that afraid of the water
so whats going on here whats happening
well the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles that form a very rough and craggly surface
youd think itd be smooth but its actually not
and it has billions of interstitial spaces and those spaces along with the nanoparticles reach up and grab the air molecules and cover the surface with air
its an umbrella of air all across it and that layer of air is what the water hits the mud hits the concrete hits and it glides right off
so if i put this inside this water here you can see a silver reflective coating around it and that silver reflective coating is the layer of air thats protecting the water from touching the paddle and its dry
so what are the applications
i mean many of you right now are probably going through your head
everyone that sees this gets excited and says oh i could use it for this and this and this
the applications in a general sense could be anything thats anti wetting
weve certainly seen that today
it could be anything thats anti icing because if you dont have water you dont have ice
it could be anti corrosion
no water no corrosion
it could be anti bacterial
without water the bacteria wont survive
and it could be things that need to be self cleaning as well
so imagine how something like this could help revolutionize your field of work
and im going to leave you with one last demonstration but before i do that i would like to say thank you and think small
its going to happen wait for it wait for it
chris anderson you guys didnt hear about us cutting out the design from ted
he ran into all sorts of problems in terms of managing the medical research part
its happening

title timothy bartik the economic case for preschool title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript in this well argued talk timothy bartik makes the macro economic case for preschool education and explains why you should be happy to invest in it even if you dont have kids that age the economic benefits of well educated kids it turns out go well beyond the altruistic description
in this talk today i want to present a different idea for why investing in early childhood education makes sense as a public investment
its a different idea because usually when people talk about early childhood programs they talk about all the wonderful benefits for participants in terms of former participants in preschool they have better k test scores better adult earnings
now thats all very important but what i want to talk about is what preschool does for state economies and for promoting state economic development
and thats actually crucial because if were going to get increased investment in early childhood programs we need to interest state governments in this
the federal government has a lot on its plate and state governments are going to have to step up
so we have to appeal to them the legislators in the state government and turn to something they understand that they have to promote the economic development of their state economy
now by promoting economic development i dont mean anything magical
all i mean is is that early childhood education can bring more and better jobs to a state and can thereby promote higher per capita earnings for the states residents
now i think its fair to say that when people think about state and local economic development they dont generally think first about what theyre doing about childcare and early childhood programs
i know this ive spent most of my career researching these programs
ive talked to a lot of directors of state economic development agencies about these issues a lot of legislators about these issues
when legislators and others think about economic development what they first of all think about are business tax incentives property tax abatements job creation tax credits you know there are a million of these programs all over the place
so for example states compete very vigorously to attract new auto plants or expanded auto plants
they hand out all kinds of business tax breaks
now those programs can make sense if they in fact induce new location decisions and the way they can make sense is by creating more and better jobs they raise employment rates raise per capita earnings of state residents
so there is a benefit to state residents that corresponds to the costs that theyre paying by paying for these business tax breaks
my argument is essentially that early childhood programs can do exactly the same thing create more and better jobs but in a different way
its a somewhat more indirect way
these programs can promote more and better jobs by you build it you invest in high quality preschool it develops the skills of your local workforce if enough of them stick around and in turn that higher quality local workforce will be a key driver of creating jobs and creating higher earnings per capita in the local community
now let me turn to some numbers on this
okay if you look at the research evidence thats extensive on how much early childhood programs affect the educational attainment wages and skills of former participants in preschool as adults you take those known effects you take how many of those folks will be expected to stick around the state or local economy and not move out and you take research on how much skills drive job creation you will conclude from these three separate lines of research that for every dollar invested in early childhood programs the per capita earnings of state residents go up by two dollars and cents so thats a three to one return
now you can get much higher returns of up to to one if you include anti crime benefits if you include benefits to former preschool participants who move to some other state but theres a good reason for focusing on these three dollars because this is salient and important to state legislators and state policy makers and its the states that are going to have to act
so there is this key benefit that is relevant to state policy makers in terms of economic development
now one objection you often hear or maybe you dont hear it because people are too polite to say it is why should i pay more taxes to invest in other peoples children
whats in it for me
and the trouble with that objection it reflects a total misunderstanding of how much local economies involve everyone being interdependent
specifically the interdependency here is is that there are huge spillovers of skills that when other peoples children get more skills that actually increases the prosperity of everyone including people whose skills dont change
so for example numerous research studies have shown if you look at what really drives the growth rate of metropolitan areas its not so much low taxes low cost low wages its the skills of the area particularly the proxy for skills that people use is percentage of college graduates in the area
so when you look for example at metropolitan areas such as the boston area minneapolis st paul silicon valley these areas are not doing well economically because theyre low cost
i dont know if you ever tried to buy a house in silicon valley
its not exactly a low cost proposition
they are growing because they have high levels of skills
so when we invest in other peoples children and build up those skills we increase the overall job growth of a metro area
as another example if we look at what determines an individuals wages and we do statistical exploration of that what determines wages we know that the individuals wages will depend in part on that individuals education for example whether or not they have a college degree
one of the very interesting facts is that in addition we find that even once we hold constant statistically the effect of your own education the education of everyone else in your metropolitan area also affects your wages
so specifically if you hold constant your education you stick in percentage of college graduates in your metro area you will find that has a significant positive effect on your wages without changing your education at all
in fact this effect is so strong that when someone gets a college degree the spillover effects of this on the wages of others in the metropolitan area are actually greater than the direct effects
so if someone gets a college degree their lifetime earnings go up by a huge amount over dollars
theres an effect on everyone else in the metro area of driving up the percentage of college graduates in the metro area and if you add that up its a small effect for each person but if you add that up across all the people in the metro area you actually get that the increase in wages for everyone else in the metropolitan area adds up to almost a million dollars
thats actually greater than the direct benefits of the person choosing to get education
now whats going on here
what can explain these huge spillover effects of education
well lets think about it this way
i can be the most skilled person in the world but if everyone else at my firm lacks skills my employer is going to find it more difficult to introduce new technology new production techniques
so as a result my employer is going to be less productive
they will not be able to afford to pay me as good wages
even if everyone at my firm has good skills if the workers at the suppliers to my firm do not have good skills my firm is going to be less competitive competing in national and international markets
and again the firm thats less competitive will not be able to pay as good wages and then particularly in high tech businesses theyre constantly stealing ideas and workers from other businesses
so clearly the productivity of firms in silicon valley has a lot to do with the skills not only of the workers at their firm but the workers at all the other firms in the metro area
so as a result if we can invest in other peoples children through preschool and other early childhood programs that are high quality we not only help those children we help everyone in the metropolitan area gain in wages and well have the metropolitan area gain in job growth
another objection used sometimes here to invest in early childhood programs is concern about people moving out
so you know maybe ohios thinking about investing in more preschool education for children in columbus ohio but theyre worried that these little buckeyes will for some strange reason decide to move to ann arbor michigan and become wolverines
and maybe michigan will be thinking about investing in preschool in ann arbor michigan and be worried these little wolverines will end up moving to ohio and becoming buckeyes
and so theyll both underinvest because everyones going to move out
well the reality is if you look at the data americans arent as hyper mobile as people sometimes assume
the data is that over percent of americans spend most of their working careers in the state they were born in over percent
that percentage does not vary much from state to state
it doesnt vary much with the states economy whether its depressed or booming it doesnt vary much over time
so the reality is if you invest in kids they will stay
or at least enough of them will stay that it will pay off for your state economy
okay so to sum up there is a lot of research evidence that early childhood programs if run in a high quality way pay off in higher adult skills
theres a lot of research evidence that those folks will stick around the state economy and theres a lot of evidence that having more workers with higher skills in your local economy pays off in higher wages and job growth for your local economy and if you calculate the numbers for each dollar we get about three dollars back in benefits for the state economy
so in my opinion the research evidence is compelling and the logic of this is compelling
so what are the barriers to getting it done
well one obvious barrier is cost
so if you look at what it would cost if every state government invested in universal preschool at age four full day preschool at age four the total annual national cost would be roughly billion dollars
so billion dollars is a lot of money
on the other hand if you reflect on that the u s s population is over million were talking about an amount of money that amounts to dollars per capita
okay a hundred dollars per capita per person is something that any state government can afford to do
its just a simple matter of political will to do it
and of course as i mentioned this cost has corresponding benefits
i mentioned theres a multiplier of about three for the state economy in terms of over billion in extra earnings
and if we want to translate that from just billions of dollars to something that might mean something what were talking about is that for the average low income kid that would increase earnings by about percent over their whole career just doing the preschool not improving k or anything else after that not doing anything with college tuition or access just directly improving preschool and we would get five percent higher earnings for middle class kids
so this is an investment that pays off in very concrete terms for a broad range of income groups in the states population and produces large and tangible benefits
now thats one barrier
i actually think the more profound barrier is the long term nature of the benefits from early childhood programs
so the argument im making is is that were increasing the quality of our local workforce and thereby increasing economic development
obviously if we have a preschool with four year olds were not sending these kids out at age five to work in the sweatshops right at least i hope not
so were talking about an investment that in terms of impacts on the state economy is not going to really pay off for or years and of course america is notorious for being a short term oriented society
now one response you can make to this and i sometimes have done this in talks is people can talk about there are benefits for these programs in reducing special ed and remedial education costs there are benefits parents care about preschool maybe well get some migration effects from parents seeking good preschool and i think those are true but in some sense theyre missing the point
ultimately this is something were investing in now for the future
and so what i want to leave you with is what i think is the ultimate question
i mean im an economist but this is ultimately not an economic question its a moral question are we willing as americans are we as a society still capable of making the political choice to sacrifice now by paying more taxes in order to improve the long term future of not only our kids but our community
are we still capable of that as a country
and thats something that each and every citizen and voter needs to ask themselves
is that something that you are still invested in that you still believe in the notion of investment
that is the notion of investment
you sacrifice now for a return later
so i think the research evidence on the benefits of early childhood programs for the local economy is extremely strong
however the moral and political choice is still up to us as citizens and as voters
thank you very much

title tod machover dan ellsey inventing instruments that unlock new music title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript tod machover of mits media lab is devoted to extending musical expression to everyone from virtuosos to amateurs and in the most diverse forms from opera to video games he and composer dan ellsey shed light on whats next description
the first idea id like to suggest is that we all love music a great deal it means a lot to us
but music is even more powerful if you dont just listen to it but you make it yourself
so thats my first idea and we all know about the mozart effect the idea thats been around for the last five to years that just by listening to music or by playing music to your baby that itll raise our iq points percent
great idea but it doesnt work at all
so you cant just listen to music you have to make it somehow
and id add to that that its not just making it but everybody each of us everybody in the world has the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way and thats one of the main parts of my work
so with the mit media lab for quite a while now weve been engaged in a field called active music
what are all the possible ways that we can think of to get everybody in the middle of a musical experience not just listening but making music
and we started by making instruments for some of the worlds greatest performers we call these hyperinstruments for yo yo ma peter gabriel prince orchestras rock bands instruments where theyre all kinds of sensors built right into the instrument so the instrument knows how its being played
and just by changing the interpretation and the feeling i can turn my cello into a voice or into a whole orchestra or into something that nobody has ever heard before
when we started making these i started thinking why cant we make wonderful instruments like that for everybody people who arent fantastic yo yo mas or princes
so weve made a whole series of instruments
one of the largest collections is called the brain opera
its a whole orchestra of about instruments all designed for anybody to play using natural skill
so you can play a video game drive through a piece of music use your body gesture to control huge masses of sound touch a special surface to make melodies use your voice to make a whole aura
and when we make the brain opera we invite the public to come in to try these instruments and then collaborate with us to help make each performance of the brain opera
we toured that for a long time it is now permanently in vienna where we built a museum around it
and that led to something which you probably do know
guitar hero came out of our lab and my two teenage daughters and most of the students at the mit media lab are proof that if you make the right kind of interface people are really interested in being in the middle of a piece of music and playing it over and over and over again
so the model works but its only the tip of the iceberg because my second idea is that its not enough just to want to make music in something like guitar hero
and music is very fun but its also transformative
its very very important
music can change your life more than almost anything
it can change the way you communicate with others it can change your body it can change your mind so were trying to go to the next step of how you build on top of something like guitar hero
we are very involved in education we have a long term project called toy symphony where we make all kinds of instruments that are also addictive but for little kids so the kids will fall in love with making music want to spend their time doing it and then will demand to know how it works how to make more how to create so we make squeezy instruments like these music shapers that measure the electricity in your fingers beatbugs that let you tap in rhythms they gather your rhythm and like hot potato you send your rhythm to your friends who then have to imitate or respond to what your doing and a software package called hyperscore which lets anybody use lines and color to make quite sophisticated music extremely easy to use but once you use it you can go quite deep music in any style and then by pressing a button it turns into music notation so that live musicians can play your pieces
weve had good enough really very powerful effects with kids around the world and now people of all ages using hyperscore
so weve gotten more and more interested in using these kinds of creative activities in a much broader context for all kinds of people who dont usually have the opportunity to make music
so one of the growing fields that were working on at the media lab right now is music mind and health
a lot of you have probably seen oliver sacks wonderful new book called musicophilia its on sale in the bookstore its a great book
if you havent seen it its worth reading hes a pianist himself and he details his whole career of looking at and observing incredibly powerful effects that music has had on peoples lives in unusual situations
so we know for instance that music is almost always the last thing that people with advanced alzheimers can still respond to
maybe many of you have noticed this with loved ones you can find somebody who cant recognize their face in the mirror or cant tell anyone in their family but you can still find a shard of music that that person will jump out of the chair and start singing and with that you can bring back parts of peoples memories and personalities
music is the best way to restore speech to people who have lost it through strokes movement to people with parkinsons disease
its very powerful for depression schizophrenia many many things
so were working on understanding those underlying principles and then building activities which will let music really improve peoples health
and we do this in many ways we work with many different hospitals
one of them is right near boston called tewksbury hospital
its a long term state hospital where several years ago we started working with hyperscore and patients with physical and mental disabilities
this has become a central part of the treatment at tewksbury hospital so everybody there clamors to work on musical activities
its the activity that seems to accelerate peoples treatment the most and it also brings the entire hospital together as a kind of musical community
i wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before i go on
video theyre manipulating each others rhythms
its a real experience not only to learn how to play and listen to rhythms but to train your musical memory and playing music in a group
to get their hands on music to shape it themselves change it to experiment with it to make their own music
so hyperscore lets you start from scratch very quickly
everybody can experience music in a profound way we just have to make different tools
the third idea i want to share with you is that music paradoxically i think even more than words is one of the very best ways we have of showing who we really are i love giving talks although strangely i feel more nervous giving talks than playing music
if i were here playing cello or playing on a synth or sharing my music with you id be able to show things about myself that i cant tell you in words more personal things perhaps deeper things
i think thats true for many of us and i want to give you two examples of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have from ourselves to the outside world
the first is a really crazy project that were building right now called death and the powers and its a big opera one of the larger opera projects going on in the world right now
and its about a man rich successful powerful who wants to live forever
so he figures out a way to download himself into his environment actually into a series of books
so this guy wants to live forever he downloads himself into his environment
the main singer disappears at the beginning of the opera and the entire stage becomes the main character it becomes his legacy
and the opera is about what we can share what we can pass on to others to the people we love and what we cant
every object in the opera comes alive and is a gigantic music instrument like this chandelier it takes up the whole stage it looks like a chandelier but its actually a robotic music instrument
so as you can see in this prototype gigantic piano strings each string is controlled with a little robotic element either little bows that stroke the strings propellers that tickle the strings acoustic signals that vibrate the strings we also have an army of robots on stage
these robots are the kind of the intermediary between the main character simon powers and his family there are a whole series of them kind of like a greek chorus
they observe the action weve designed these square robots that were testing right now at mit called operabots these operabots follow my music
they follow the characters theyre smart enough we hope not to bump into each other they go off on their own
and then they can also when you snap line up exactly the way youd like to
even though theyre cubes they actually have a lot of personality
the largest set piece in the opera is called the system its a series of books
every single book is robotic so they all move they all make sound and when you put them all together they turn into these walls which have the gesture and the personality of simon powers so hes disappeared but the whole physical environment becomes this person
this is how hes chosen to represent himself
the books also have high packed leds on the spines so its all display
and heres the great baritone james maddalena as he enters the system
this is a sneak preview
this premieres in monaco its in september if by any chance you cant make it another idea with this project heres this guy building his legacy through this very unusual form through music and through the environment
but were also making this available both online and in public spaces as a way of each of us to use music and images from our lives to make our own legacy or to make a legacy of someone we love
so instead of being grand opera this opera will turn into what were thinking of as personal opera
and if youre going to make a personal opera what about a personal instrument
everything ive shown you so far whether its a hyper cello for yo yo ma or squeezy toy for a child the instruments stayed the same and are valuable for a certain class of person a virtuoso a child
but what if i could make an instrument that could be adapted to the way i personally behave to the way my hands work to what i do very skillfully perhaps to what i dont do so skillfully
i think that this is the future of interface its the future of music the future of instruments
and id like now to invite two very special people on the stage so that i can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like
so can you give a hand to adam boulanger ph d student from the mit media lab and dan ellsey dan thanks to ted and to bombardier flexjet dan is here with us today all the way from tewksbury hes a resident at tewksbury hospital
this is by far the farthest hes strayed from tewksbury hospital i can tell you that because hes motivated to meet with you today and show you his own music
so first of all dan do you want to say hi to everyone and tell everyone who you are
dan ellsey hello my name is dan ellsey i am years old and i have cerebral palsy
i have always loved music and i am excited to be able to conduct my own music with this new software
tod machover and were really excited to have you here really dan
so we met dan about three years ago three and a half years ago when we started working at tewksbury everybody we met there was fantastic did fantastic music dan had never made music before and it turned out he was really fantastic at it hes a born composer
hes very shy too
so turned out hes a fantastic composer and over the last few years has been a constant collaborator of ours he has made many many pieces
he makes his own cds actually he is quite well known in the boston area mentors people at the hospital and children locally in how to make their own music
and ill let adam tell you so adam is a ph d student at mit an expert in music technology and medicine and adam and dan have become close collaborators
what adams been working on for this last period is not only how to have dan be able easily to make his own pieces but how he can perform his piece using this kind of personal instrument
so you want to say a little bit about how you guys work
adam boulanger yes so tod and i entered into a discussion following the tewksbury work and it was really about how dan is an expressive person and hes an intelligent and creative person and its in his face its in his breathing its in his eyes how come he cant perform one of his pieces of music thats our responsibility and it doesnt make sense
so we started developing a technology that will allow him with nuance with precision with control and despite his physical disability to be able to do that to be able to perform his piece of music
so the process and the technology basically first we needed an engineering solution so you know we have a firewire camera it looked at an infrared pointer
we went with the type of gesture metaphor that dan was already used to with his speaking controller
and this was actually the least interesting part of the work you know the design process we needed an input we needed continuous tracking in the software we look at the types of shapes hes making
but then was the really interesting aspect of the work following the engineering part where basically were coding over dans shoulder at the hospital extensively to figure out you know how does dan move
whats useful to him as an expressive motion
you know whats his metaphor for performance
what types of things does he find important to control and convey in a piece of music
so all the parameter fitting and really the technology was stretched at that point to fit just dan
and you know i think this is a perspective shift its not that our technologies they provide access they allow us to create pieces of creative work
but what about expression what about that moment when an artist delivers that piece of work you know do our technologies allow us to express
do they provide structure for us to do that and you know thats a personal relationship to expression that is lacking in the technological sphere so you know with dan we needed a new design process a new engineering process to sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to perform
and so thats what well do today
tm so lets do it so dan do you want to tell everyone about what youre going to play now
de this is my eagle song
tm so dan is going to play a piece of his called my eagle song
in fact this is the score for dans piece completely composed by dan in hyperscore
so he can use his infrared tracker to go directly into hyperscore
hes incredibly fast at it too faster than i am in fact
tm hes really modest too
so he can go in hyperscore you start out by making melodies and rhythms
he can place those exactly where he wants
each one gets a color he goes back into the composition window draws the lines places everything the way he wants to looking at the hyperscore you can see it also you can see where the sections are something might continue for a while change get really crazy and then end up with a big bang at the end
so thats the way he made his piece and as adam says we then figured out the best way to have him perform his piece
its going to be looked at by this camera analyze his movements its going to let dan bring out all the different aspects of his music that he wants to
and youre also going to notice a visual on the screen
we asked one of our students to look at what the camera is measuring
but instead of making it very literal showing you exactly the camera tracing we turned it into a graphic that shows you the basic movement and shows the way its being analyzed
i think it gives an understanding of how were picking out movement from what dans doing but i think it will also show you if you look at that movement that when dan makes music his motions are very purposeful very precise very disciplined and theyre also very beautiful
so in hearing this piece as i mentioned before the most important thing is the musics great and itll show you who dan is
so are we ready adam
ab yeah
tm ok now dan will play his piece my eagle song for you
tm bravo

this is the venue where as a young man some of the music that i wrote was first performed
it was remarkably a pretty good sounding room
with all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere it actually sounded pretty good
this is a song that was recorded there
this is not talking heads in the picture anyway
by talking heads so the nature of the room meant that words could be understood
the lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood
the sound system was kind of decent
and there wasnt a lot of reverberation in the room
so the rhythms could be pretty intact too pretty concise
other places around the country had similar rooms
this is tootsies orchid lounge in nashville
the music was in some ways different but in structure and form very much the same
the clientele behavior was very much the same too
and so the bands at tootsies or at cbgbs had to play loud enough the volume had to be loud enough to overcome people falling down shouting out and doing whatever else they were doing
since then ive played other places that are much nicer
ive played the disney hall here and carnegie hall and places like that
and its been very exciting
but i also noticed that sometimes the music that i had written or was writing at the time didnt sound all that great in some of those halls
we managed but sometimes those halls didnt seem exactly suited to the music i was making or had made
so i asked myself do i write stuff for specific rooms
do i have a place a venue in mind when i write
is that a kind of model for creativity
do we all make things with a venue a context in mind
okay africa
most of the popular music that we know now has a big part of its roots in west africa
and the music there i would say the instruments the intricate rhythms the way its played the setting the context its all perfect it all works perfect
the music works perfectly in that setting
theres no big room to create reverberation and confuse the rhythms
the instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification etc etc
its no accident
its perfect for that particular context
and it would be a mess in a context like this this is a gothic cathedral
in a gothic cathedral this kind of music is perfect
it doesnt change key the notes are long theres almost no rhythm whatsoever and the room flatters the music
it actually improves it
this is the room that bach wrote some of his music for this is the organ
its not as big as a gothic cathedral so he can write things that are a little bit more intricate
he can very innovatively actually change keys without risking huge dissonances
this is a little bit later
this is the kind of rooms that mozart wrote in
i think were in like somewhere around there
theyre smaller even less reverberant so he can write really frilly music thats very intricate and it works
it fits the room perfectly
this is la scala
its around the same time i think it was built around
people in the audience in these opera houses when they were built they used to yell out to one another
they used to eat drink and yell out to people on the stage just like they do at cbgbs and places like that
if they liked an aria they would holler and suggest that it be done again as an encore not at the end of the show but immediately
and well that was an opera experience
this is the opera house that wagner built for himself
and the size of the room is not that big
its smaller than this
but wagner made an innovation
he wanted a bigger band
he wanted a little more bombast so he increased the size of the orchestra pit so he could get more low end instruments in there
okay
this is carnegie hall
obviously this kind of thing became popular
the halls got bigger carnegie halls fair sized
its larger than some of the other symphony halls
and theyre a lot more reverberant than la scala
around the same according to alex ross who writes for the new yorker this kind of rule came into effect that audiences had to be quiet no more eating drinking and yelling at the stage or gossiping with one another during the show
they had to be very quiet
so those two things combined meant that a different kind of music worked best in these kind of halls
it meant that there could be extreme dynamics which there werent in some of these other kinds of music
quiet parts could be heard that would have been drowned out by all the gossiping and shouting
but because of the reverberation in those rooms like carnegie hall the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic and a little more textural
this is mahler
it looks like bob dylan but its mahler
that was bobs last record yeah
popular music coming along at the same time
this is a jazz band
according to scott joplin the bands were playing on riverboats and clubs
again its noisy theyre playing for dancers
theres certain sections of the song the songs had different sections that the dancers really liked
and theyd say play that part again
well theres only so many times you can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers
so the bands started to improvise new melodies
and a new form of music was born
these are played mainly in small rooms
people are dancing shouting and drinking
so the music has to be loud enough to be heard above that
same thing goes true for thats the beginning of the century for the whole of century popular music whether its rock or latin music or whatever
doesnt really change that much
it changes about a third of the way into the century when this became one of the primary venues for music
and this was one way that the music got there
microphones enabled singers in particular and musicians and composers to completely change the kind of music that they were writing
so far a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music but singers like frank sinatra could use the mic and do things that they could never do without a microphone
other singers after him went even further
this is chet baker
and this kind of thing would have been impossible without a microphone
it would have been impossible without recorded music as well
and hes singing right into your ear
hes whispering into your ears
the effect is just electric
its like the guy is sitting next to you whispering who knows what into your ear
so at this point music diverged
theres live music and theres recorded music
and they no longer have to be exactly the same
now theres venues like this a discotheque and theres jukeboxes in bars where you dont even need to have a band
there doesnt need to be any live performing musicians whatsoever and the sound systems are good
people began to make music specifically for discos and for those sound systems
and as with jazz the dancers liked certain sections more than they did others
so the early hip hop guys would loop certain sections
the mc would improvise lyrics in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies
and another new form of music was born
live performance when it was incredibly successful ended up in what is probably acoustically the worst sounding venues on the planet sports stadiums basketball arenas and hockey arenas
musicians who ended up there did the best they could
they wrote what is now called arena rock which is medium speed ballads
they did the best they could given that this is what theyre writing for
the tempos are medium it sounds big
its more a social situation than a musical situation
and in some ways the music that theyre writing for this place works perfectly
so theres more new venues
one of the new ones is the automobile
i grew up with a radio in a car
but now thats evolved into something else
the car is a whole venue
the music that i would say is written for automobile sound systems works perfectly on it
it might not be what you want to listen to at home but it works great in the car has a huge frequency spectrum you know big bass and high end and the voice kind of stuck in the middle
automobile music you can share with your friends
theres one other kind of new venue the private player
presumably this is just for christian music
and in some ways its like carnegie hall or when the audience had to hush up because you can now hear every single detail
in other ways its more like the west african music because if the music in an player gets too quiet you turn it up and the next minute your ears are blasted out by a louder passage
so that doesnt really work
i think pop music mainly its written today to some extent is written for these kind of players for this kind of personal experience where you can hear extreme detail but the dynamic doesnt change that much
so i asked myself okay is this a model for creation this adaptation that we do
and does it happen anywhere else
well according to david attenborough and some other people birds do it too that the birds in the canopy where the foliage is dense their calls tend to be high pitched short and repetitive
and the birds on the floor tend to have lower pitched calls so that they dont get distorted when they bounce off the forest floor
and birds like this savannah sparrow they tend to have a buzzing type call
and it turns out that a sound like this is the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their call across the fields and savannahs
other birds like this tanager have adapted within the same species
the tananger on the east coast of the united states where the forests are a little denser has one kind of call and the tananger on the other side on the west has a different kind of call
so birds do it too
and i thought well if this is a model for creation if we make music primarily the form at least to fit these contexts and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls and if we write software to fit existing operating systems is that how it works
yeah i think its evolutionary
its adaptive
but the pleasure and the passion and the joy is still there
this is a reverse view of things from the kind of traditional romantic view
the romantic view is that first comes the passion and then the outpouring of emotion and then somehow it gets shaped into something
and im saying well the passions still there but the vessel that its going to be injected into and poured into that is instinctively and intuitively created first
we already know where that passion is going
but this conflict of views is kind of interesting
the writer thomas frank says that this might be a kind of explanation why some voters vote against their best interests that voters like a lot of us assume that if they hear something that sounds like its sincere that its coming from the gut that its passionate that its more authentic
and theyll vote for that
so that if somebody can fake sincerity if they can fake passion they stand a better chance of being selected in that way which seems a little dangerous
im saying the two the passion the joy are not mutually exclusive
maybe what the world needs now is for us to realize that we are like the birds
we adapt
we sing
and like the birds the joy is still there even though we have changed what we do to fit the context
thank you very much

title ronny edry israel and iran a love story title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript when war between israel and iran seemed imminent israeli graphic designer ronny edry shared a poster on facebook of himself and his daughter with a bold message iranians we you other israelis quickly created their own posters with the same message and iranians responded in kind the simple act of communication inspired surprising facebook communities like israel loves iran iran loves israel and even palestine loves israel description
on march this year i posted this poster on facebook
this is an image of me and my daughter holding the israeli flag
i will try to explain to you about the context of why and when i posted
a few days ago i was sitting waiting and the owner and one of the clients were talking to each other and the owner was explaining to the client that were going to get missiles on israel
and the client was saying no its a day
this is the context this is where we are now in israel
we have this war with iran coming for years now and we have people you know afraid
its like every year its the last minute that we can do something about the war with iran
its like if we dont act now its too late forever for years now
so at some point it became you know to me im a graphic designer so i made posters about it and i posted the one i just showed you before
most of the time i make posters i post them on facebook my friends like it dont like it most of the time dont like it dont share it dont nothing and its another day
so i went to sleep and that was it for me
and later on in the night i woke up because im always waking up in the night and i went by the computer and i see all these red dots you know on facebook which ive never seen before
and i was like whats going on
so i come to the computer and i start looking on and suddenly i see many people talking to me most of them i dont know and a few of them from iran which is what
because you have to understand in israel we dont talk with people from iran
we dont know people from iran
its like on facebook you have friends only from its like your neighbors are your friends on facebook
and now people from iran are talking to me
so i start answering this girl and shes telling me she saw the poster and she asked her family to come because they dont have a computer she asked her family to come to see the poster and theyre all sitting in the living room crying
so im like whoa
i ask my wife to come and i tell her you have to see that
people are crying and she came she read the text and she started to cry
and everybodys crying now
so i dont know what to do so my first reflex as a graphic designer is you know to show everybody what id just seen and people started to see them and to share them and thats how it started
the day after when really it became a lot of talking i said to myself and my wife said to me i also want a poster so this is her
because its working put me in a poster now
but more seriously i was like okay these ones work but its not just about me its about people from israel who want to say something
so im going to shoot all the people i know if they want and im going to put them in a poster and im going to share them
so i went to my neighbors and friends and students and i just asked them give me a picture i will make you a poster
and thats how it started and thats how really its unleashed because suddenly people from facebook friends and others just understand that they can be part of it
its not just one dude making one poster its we can be part of it so they start sending me pictures and ask me make me a poster post it
tell the iranians we from israel love you too
it became you know at some point it was really really intense
i mean so many pictures so i asked friends to come graphic designers most of them to make posters with me because i didnt have the time
it was a huge amount of pictures
so for a few days thats how my living room was
and we received israeli posters israeli images but also lots of comments lots of messages from iran
and we took these messages and we made posters out of it because i know people they dont read they see images
if its an image they may read it
so here are a few of them
this one is really moving for me because its the story of a girl who has been raised in iran to walk on an israeli flag to enter her school every morning and now that she sees the posters that were sending she starts she said that she changed her mind and now she loves that blue she loves that star and she loves that flag talking about the israeli flag and she wished that wed meet and come to visit one another and just a few days after i posted the first poster
the day after iranians started to respond with their own posters
they have graphic designers what
crazy crazy
so you can see they are still shy they dont want to show their faces but they want to spread the message
they want to respond they want to say the same thing
so and now its communication
its a two way story its israelis and iranians sending the same message one to each other
this never happened before and this is two people supposed to be enemies were on the verge of a war and suddenly people on facebook are starting to say i like this guy i love those guys
and it became really big at some point
and then it became news
because when youre seeing the middle east you see only the bad news
and suddenly there is something that was happening they say okay lets talk about this
and they just came and it was so much i remember one day michal she was talking with the journalist and she was asking him whos gonna see the show and he said everybody
so she said everybody in palestine in where israel
who is everybody everybody
they said syria syria
lebanon lebanon
at some point he just said million people are going to see you today
its everybody the chinese
and we were just at the beginning of the story
something crazy also happened
every time a country started talking about it like germany america wherever a page on facebook popped up with the same logo with the same stories so at the beginning we had iran loves israel which is an iranian sitting in tehran saying okay israel loves iran
i give you iran loves israel
you have palestine loves israel
you have lebanon that just a few days ago
and this whole list of pages on facebook dedicated to the same message to people sending their love one to each other
the moment i really understood that something was happening a friend of mine told me google the word israel and those were the first images on those days that popped up from google when you were typing israel or iran
we really changed how people see the middle east
because youre not in the middle east
youre somewhere over there and then you want to see the middle east so you go on google and you say israel and they give you the bad stuff
and for a few days you got those images
today the israel loves iran page is this number and two million people last week went on the page and shared liked i dont know commented on one of the photos
so for five months now thats what we are doing me michal a few of my friends are just making images
were showing a new reality by just making images because thats how the world perceives us
they see images of us and they see bad images
so were working on making good images end of story
look at this one this is the iran loves israel page
this is not the israel loves iran this is not my page
this is a guy in tehran on the day of remembrance of the israeli fallen soldier putting an image of an israeli soldier on his page
this is the enemy
what
and its going both ways
its like we are showing respect one to each other
and were understanding and you show compassion
and you become friends
and at some point you become friends on facebook and you become friends in life
you can go and travel and meet people
and i was in munich a few weeks ago
i went there to open an exposition about iran and i met there with people from the page that told me okay youre going to be in europe im coming im coming from france from holland from germany of course and from israel people came and we just met there for the first time in real life
i met with people that are supposed to be my enemies for the first time and we just shake hands and have a coffee and a nice discussion and we talk about food and basketball
and that was the end of it
remember that image from the beginning
at some point we met in real life and we became friends
and it goes the other way around
some girl that we met on facebook never been in israel born and raised in iran lives in germany afraid of israelis because of what she knows about us decides after a few months of talking on the internet with some israelis to come to israel and she gets on the plane and arrives at ben gurion and says okay not that big a deal
so a few weeks ago the stress is getting higher so we start this new campaign called not ready to die in your war
i mean its plus minus the same message but we wanted really to add some aggressivity to it
and again something amazing happened something that we didnt have on the first wave of the campaign
now people from iran the same ones who were shy at the first campaign and just sent you know their foot and half their faces now theyre sending their faces and theyre saying okay no problem were into it we are with you
just read where those guys are from
and for every guy from israel youve got someone from iran
just people sending their pictures
crazy yes
so so you may ask yourself who is this dude
my name is ronny edry and im im an israeli im a father of two im a husband and im a graphic designer im teaching graphic design
and im not that naive because a lot of the time ive been asked many times ive been asked yeah but this is really naive sending flowers over i mean i was in the army i was in the paratroopers for three years and i know how it looks from the ground
i know how it can look really bad
so to me this is the courageous thing to do to try to reach the other side before its too late because when its going to be too late its going to be too late
and sometimes war is inevitable sometimes but maybe effort we can avoid it
maybe as people because especially in israel were in a democracy we have the freedom of speech and maybe that little thing can change something
and really we can be our own ambassadors
we can just send a message and hope for the best
so i want to ask michal my wife to come with me on the stage just to make with you one image because its all about images
and maybe that image will help us change something
just raise that exactly
and im just going to take a picture of it and im just going to post it on facebook with kind of israelis for peace or something
oh my god
dont cry
thank you guys

title charles moore seas of plastic title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript capt charles moore of the algalita marine research foundation first discovered the great pacific garbage patch an endless floating waste of plastic trash now hes drawing attention to the growing choking problem of plastic debris in our seas description
lets talk trash
you know we had to be taught to renounce the powerful conservation ethic we developed during the great depression and world war ii
after the war we needed to direct our enormous production capacity toward creation of products for peacetime
life magazine helped in this effort by announcing the introduction of throwaways that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes
mental note to the liberators throwaway plastics take a lot of space and dont biodegrade
only we humans make waste that nature cant digest
plastics are also hard to recycle
a teacher told me how to express the under five percent of plastics recovered in our waste stream
its diddly point squat
thats the percentage we recycle
now melting point has a lot to do with this
plastic is not purified by the re melting process like glass and metal
it begins to melt below the boiling point of water and does not drive off the oily contaminants for which it is a sponge
half of each years billion pounds of thermal plastic pellets will be made into fast track trash
a large unruly fraction of our trash will flow downriver to the sea
here is the accumulation at biona creek next to the l a airport
and here is the flotsam near california state university long beach and the diesel plant we visited yesterday
in spite of deposit fees much of this trash leading out to the sea will be plastic beverage bottles
we use two million of them in the united states every five minutes here imaged by ted presenter chris jordan who artfully documents mass consumption and zooms in for more detail
here is a remote island repository for bottles off the coast of baja california
isla san roque is an uninhabited bird rookery off bajas sparsely populated central coast
notice that the bottles here have caps on them
bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate pet will sink in seawater and not make it this far from civilization
also the caps are produced in separate factories from a different plastic polypropylene
they will float in seawater but unfortunately do not get recycled under the bottle bills
lets trace the journey of the millions of caps that make it to sea solo
after a year the ones from japan are heading straight across the pacific while ours get caught in the california current and first head down to the latitude of cabo san lucas
after ten years a lot of the japanese caps are in what we call the eastern garbage patch while ours litter the philippines
after years we see emerging the debris accumulation zone of the north pacific gyre
it so happens that millions of albatross nesting on kure and midway atolls in the northwest hawaiian islands national monument forage here and scavenge whatever they can find for regurgitation to their chicks
a four month old laysan albatross chick died with this in its stomach
hundreds of thousands of the goose sized chicks are dying with stomachs full of bottle caps and other rubbish like cigarette lighters
but mostly bottle caps
sadly their parents mistake bottle caps for food tossing about in the ocean surface
the retainer rings for the caps also have consequences for aquatic animals
this is mae west still alive at a zookeepers home in new orleans
i wanted to see what my home town of long beach was contributing to the problem so on coastal clean up day in i went to the long beach peninsula at the east end of our long beach
we cleaned up the swaths of beach shown
i offered five cents each for bottle caps
i got plenty of takers
here are the bottle caps they collected
i thought i would spend bucks
that day i ended up spending nearly
i separated them by color and put them on display the next earth day at cabrillo marine aquarium in san pedro
governor schwarzenegger and his wife maria stopped by to discuss the display
in spite of my girly man hat crocheted from plastic shopping bags they shook my hand
i showed him and maria a zooplankton trawl from the gyre north of hawaii with more plastic than plankton
heres what our trawl samples from the plastic soup our ocean has become look like
trawling a zooplankton net on the surface for a mile produces samples like this
and this
now when the debris washes up on the beaches of hawaii it looks like this
and this particular beach is kailua beach the beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving to washington
now how do we analyze samples like this one that contain more plastic than plankton
we sort the plastic fragments into different size classes from five millimeters to one third of a millimeter
small bits of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutants up to a million times their levels in the surrounding seawater
we wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean at the base of the food chain was ingesting these poison pills
we did hundreds of necropsies and over a third had polluted plastic fragments in their stomachs
the record holder only two and a half inches long had pieces in its tiny stomach
now you can buy certified organic produce
but no fishmonger on earth can sell you a certified organic wild caught fish
this is the legacy we are leaving to future generations
the throwaway society cannot be contained it has gone global
we simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff
we have to throw it away
now the market can do a lot for us but it cant fix the natural system in the ocean weve broken
all the kings horses and all the kings men
will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again
narrator the levels are increasing the amount of packaging is increasing the throwaway concept of living is proliferating and its showing up in the ocean
anchor he offers no hope of cleaning it up
straining the ocean for plastic would be beyond the budget of any country and it might kill untold amounts of sea life in the process
the solution moore says is to stop the plastic at its source stop it on land before it falls in the ocean
and in a plastic wrapped and packaged world he doesnt hold out much hope for that either
this is brian rooney for nightline in long beach california
charles moore thank you

title carolyn steel how food shapes our cities title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript every day in a city the size of london million meals are served but where does all the food come from architect carolyn steel discusses the daily miracle of feeding a city and shows how ancient food routes shaped the modern world description
how do you feed a city
its one of the great questions of our time
yet its one thats rarely asked
we take it for granted that if we go into a shop or restaurant or indeed into this theaters foyer in about an hours time there is going to be food there waiting for us having magically come from somewhere
but when you think that every day for a city the size of london enough food has to be produced transported bought and sold cooked eaten disposed of and that something similar has to happen every day for every city on earth its remarkable that cities get fed at all
we live in places like this as if theyre the most natural things in the world forgetting that because were animals and that we need to eat were actually as dependent on the natural world as our ancient ancestors were
and as more of us move into cities more of that natural world is being transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me its soybean fields in mato grosso in brazil in order to feed us
these are extraordinary landscapes but few of us ever get to see them
and increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either
as more of us move into cities more of us are eating meat so that a third of the annual grain crop globally now gets fed to animals rather than to us human animals
and given that it takes three times as much grain actually ten times as much grain to feed a human if its passed through an animal first thats not a very efficient way of feeding us
and its an escalating problem too
by its estimated that twice the number of us are going to be living in cities
and its also estimated that there is going to be twice as much meat and dairy consumed
so meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand
and thats going to pose an enormous problem
six billion hungry carnivores to feed by
thats a big problem and actually if we carry on as we are its a problem were very unlikely to be able to solve
nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land
although at the same time were losing an equivalent amount of existing arables to salinization and erosion
were very hungry for fossil fuels too
it takes about calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the west
and even though there is food that we are producing at great cost we dont actually value it
half the food produced in the usa is currently thrown away
and to end all of this at the end of this long process were not even managing to feed the planet properly
a billion of us are obese while a further billion starve
none of it makes very much sense
and when you think that percent of global trade in food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations its a grim picture
as were moving into cities the world is also embracing a western diet
and if we look to the future its an unsustainable diet
so how did we get here
and more importantly what are we going to do about it
well to answer the slightly easier question first about years ago i would say is the beginning of this process in the ancient near east known as the fertile crescent
because as you can see it was crescent shaped
and it was also fertile
and it was here about years ago that two extraordinary inventions agriculture and urbanism happened roughly in the same place and at the same time
this is no accident because agriculture and cities are bound together they need each other
because it was discovery of grain by our ancient ancestors for the first time that produced a food source that was large enough and stable enough to support permanent settlements
and if we look at what those settlements were like we see they were compact
they were surrounded by productive farm land and dominated by large temple complexes like this one at ur that were in fact effectively spiritualized central food distribution centers
because it was the temples that organized the harvest gathered in the grain offered it to the gods and then offered the grain that the gods didnt eat back to the people
so if you like the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities was dominated by the grain and the harvest that sustained them
and in fact thats true of every ancient city
but of course not all of them were that small
famously rome had about a million citizens by the first century a d
so how did a city like this feed itself
the answer is what i call ancient food miles
basically rome had access to the sea which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away
this is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world because it was very difficult to transport food over roads which were rough
and the food obviously went off very quickly
so rome effectively waged war on places like carthage and egypt just to get its paws on their grain reserves
and in fact you could say that the expansion of the empire was really sort of one long drawn out militarized shopping spree really
in fact i love the fact i just have to mention this rome in fact used to import oysters from london at one stage i think thats extraordinary
so rome shaped its hinterland through its appetite
but the interesting thing is that the other thing also happened in the pre industrial world
if we look at a map of london in the century we can see that its grain which is coming in from the thames along the bottom of this map
so the grain markets were to the south of the city
and the roads leading up from them to cheapside which was the main market were also grain markets
and if you look at the name of one of those streets bread street you can tell what was going on there years ago
and the same of course was true for fish
fish was of course coming in by river as well same thing
and of course billingsgate famously was londons fish market operating on site here until the mid
which is extraordinary really when you think about it
everybody else was wandering around with mobile phones that looked like bricks and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port
this is another thing about food in cities once its roots into the city are established they very rarely move
meat is a very different story because of course animals could walk into the city
so much of londons meat was coming from the northwest from scotland and wales
so it was coming in and arriving at the city at the northwest which is why smithfield londons very famous meat market was located up there
poultry was coming in from east anglia and so on to the northeast
i feel a bit like a weather woman doing this anyway and so the birds were coming in with their feet protected with little canvas shoes
and then when they hit the eastern end of cheapside thats where they were sold which is why its called poultry
and in fact if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age you can trace food coming in to it
you can actually see how it was physically shaped by food both by reading the names of the streets which give you a lot of clues
friday street in a previous life is where you went to buy your fish on a friday
but also you have to imagine it full of food
because the streets and the public spaces were the only places where food was bought and sold
and if we look at an image of smithfield in you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be unaware of where your food came from
in fact if you were having sunday lunch the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window about three days earlier
so this was obviously an organic city part of an organic cycle
and then years later everything changed
this is an image of the great western in
and as you can see some of the earliest train passengers were pigs and sheep
so all of a sudden these animals are no longer walking into market
theyre being slaughtered out of sight and mind somewhere in the countryside
and theyre coming into the city by rail
and this changes everything
to start off with it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities really any size and shape in any place
cities used to be constrained by geography they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means
all of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography
and as you can see from these maps of london in the years after the trains came it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed by animals coming in on foot and so on to a large splurge that would be very very difficult to feed with anybody on foot either animals or people
and of course that was just the beginning after the trains came cars and really this marks the end of this process
its the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all
and this is the kind of city thats devoid of smell devoid of mess certainly devoid of people because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape
in fact what they did to get food was they got in their cars drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts came back with a weeks worth of shopping and wondered what on earth to do with it
and this really is the moment when our relationship both with food and cities changes completely
here we have food that used to be the center the social core of the city at the periphery
it used to be a social event buying and selling food
now its anonymous
we used to cook now we just add water or a little bit of an egg if youre making a cake or something
we dont smell food to see if its okay to eat
we just read the back of a label on a packet
and we dont value food we dont trust it
so instead of trusting it we fear it
and instead of valuing it we throw it away
one of the great ironies of modern food systems is that theyve made the very thing they promised to make easier much harder
by making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place theyve actually distanced us from our most important relationship which is that of us and nature
and also theyve made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver that as weve seen are unsustainable
so what are we going to do about that
its not a new question
years ago its what thomas more was asking himself
this is the frontispiece of his book utopia
and it was a series of semi independent city states if that sounds remotely familiar a days walk from one another where everyone was basically farming mad and grew vegetables in their back gardens and ate communal meals together and so on
and i think you could argue that food is a fundamental ordering principle of utopia even though more never framed it that way
and here is another very famous utopian vision that of ebenezer howard the garden city
same idea series of semi independent city states little blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around joined to one another by railway
and again food could be said to be the ordering principle of his vision
it even got built but nothing to do with this vision that howard had
and that is the problem with these utopian ideas that they are utopian
utopia was actually a word that thomas moore used deliberately
it was a kind of joke because its got a double derivation from the greek
it can either mean a good place or no place
because its an ideal its an imaginary thing we cant have it
and i think as a conceptual tool for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling that makes it not much use
so ive come up with an alternative which is sitopia from the ancient greek sitos for food and topos for place
i believe we already live in sitopia
we live in a world shaped by food and if we realize that we can use food as a really powerful tool a conceptual tool design tool to shape the world differently
so if we were to do that what might sitopia look like
well i think it looks a bit like this
i have to use this slide its just the look on the face of the dog
but anyway this is its food at the center of life at the center of family life being celebrated being enjoyed people taking time for it
this is where food should be in our society
but you cant have scenes like this unless you have people like this
by the way these can be men as well
its people who think about food who think ahead who plan who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables and actually recognize them
we need these people were part of a network
because without these kinds of people we cant have places like this
here i deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable
but networks markets where food is being grown locally
its common its fresh
its part of the social life of the city
because without that you cant have this kind of place food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape and is not just a zero sum commodity off in some unseen hell hole
cows with a view
steaming piles of humus
this is basically bringing the whole thing together
and this is a community project i visited recently in toronto
its a greenhouse where kids get told all about food and growing their own food
here is a plant called kevin or maybe its a plant belonging to a kid called kevin i dont know
but anyway these kinds of projects that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important
so sitopia for me is really a way of seeing
its basically recognizing that sitopia already exists in little pockets everywhere
the trick is to join them up to use food as a way of seeing
and if we do that were going to stop seeing cities as big metropolitan unproductive blobs like this
were going to see them more like this as part of the productive organic framework of which they are inevitably a part symbiotically connected
but of course thats not a great image either because we need not to be producing food like this anymore
we need to be thinking more about permaculture which is why i think this image just sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing
its a re conceptualization of the way food shapes our lives
the best image i know of this is from years ago
its ambrogio lorenzettis allegory of good government
its about the relationship between the city and the countryside
and i think the message of this is very clear
if the city looks after the country the country will look after the city
and i want us to ask now what would ambrogio lorenzetti paint if he painted this image today
what would an allegory of good government look like today
because i think its an urgent question
its one we have to ask and we have to start answering
we know we are what we eat
we need to realize that the world is also what we eat
but if we take that idea we can use food as a really powerful tool to shape the world better
thank you very much

title christopher c deam the airstream restyled title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript in this low key image packed talk from designer christopher c deam talks about his makeover of an american classic the airstream travel trailer description
i was asked by wilsonart international a plastic laminate company which is the largest plastic laminate company in the world they asked me to design a trade show booth for exhibition at the international contemporary furniture fair in new york in
so looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically transportation design interiors and furniture we came up with the solution of taking an old airstream trailer and gutting it and trying to portray laminate and a trailer in kind of a fresh new contemporary look
when this trailer showed up at my shop in berkeley id actually never stepped foot in an airstream trailer or any other trailer
so i can be somebody that can look at this in a totally fresh perspective and see if i can optimize it in its most idealistic fashion
i decided i had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong somewhere along the history of airstream
what i discovered in these interiors is that there was a disconnect between the exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces
in that the shell was originally conceived as a lightweight modern futuristic high tech pod for hurtling down the freeway and the interiors were completely out of sync with that
in fact it appeared like they referenced a mountain cabin
that seemed really like a crisis to me that they had never been able to develop a vocabulary about escape and about travel and modernity in this trailer that was consistent with the shell
we really needed to do some archeology in the trailer itself to figure out whats authentic in an airstream trailer and what feels like it has true purpose and utility
we stripped out all the vinyl and zolatone paint that was covering up this just fantastic aluminum shell
we took off all the visible hardware and trim that was kind of doing the country cabin thing
i literally drew on the walls of the trailer mocked it up in cardboard wed come in and cut decide things were wrong pull it out put it back in
the main goal was to smooth out the interior and begin to speak about motion and mobility and independence
the biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when youre designing theres actually no logical place to stop and start materials because of the continuous form of the trailer
theres no such things as two walls and a ceiling coming together where you can change materials and shapes
so that became a challenge
compounding that the material of choice laminate that i was trying to highlight only bends in two dimensions
its a compound curve interior
what i had to devise was a way of fooling the eye into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell
what i came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell
and what i was trying to do there was direct your eye in the space so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way and that the casework wouldnt break up the space
they also gave us a way to run power and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin so they function as an electrical chase
thats the trailer pretty much finished
that trailer led to another commission to participate in whats called tokyo designers block
its a week of furniture design events in tokyo in october
teruo kurosaki who owns a furniture company called idee he asked me to ship him two trailers to tokyo
he said one he would like to make a real trailer functioning and we would sell that one
trailer number two you have a blank slate you can to anything you want
we came up with a fantasy scenario of a dj traveling around the states that would collect records and go on tours
this trailer housed two turntables mixer wet bar fridge integrated sound system
its got a huge couch fits quite a few people and basically wed had a great time with this
and so in this trailer i took it upon myself to think about travel and escape in an idiosyncratic sense
a lot of these ideas migrated into the production trailers for airstream
this brings us up to the time that i started consulting to airstream
they came to me and said well what can we do to freshen this thing up
and do you think kids you know skateboarders surfers rock climbers would use these things
and i said well not in that interior
anyway i went out to airstream about six times during the process of building this prototype and its called the bambi prototype
i thought finally oh yeah great big company im gonna work with somebody with money for tooling and molding
and i walked in their prototype facility and its exactly like my shop only bigger same tools same things
so the problem became and they set this dilemma to me that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology and theres no money for tooling or molding
the trailers themselves are actually hand built
all the casework is hand scribed in uniquely so you cant just cut parts for trailers you have to cut them big and every single one is hand fit
they didnt want to go to a componentized system
and there it is thats the bambi

title elliot krane the mystery of chronic pain title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript we think of pain as a symptom but there are cases where the nervous system develops feedback loops and pain becomes a terrifying disease in itself starting with the story of a girl whose sprained wrist turned into a nightmare elliot krane talks about the complex mystery of chronic pain and reviews the facts were just learning about how it works and how to treat it description
im a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist so i put children to sleep for a living
and im an academic so i put audiences to sleep for free
but what i actually mostly do is i manage the pain management service at the packard childrens hospital up at stanford in palo alto
and its from the experience from about or years of doing that that i want to bring to you the message this morning that pain is a disease
now most of the time you think of pain as a symptom of a disease and thats true most of the time
its the symptom of a tumor or an infection or an inflammation or an operation
but about percent of the time after the patient has recovered from one of those events pain persists
it persists for months and oftentimes for years and when that happens it is its own disease
and before i tell you about how it is that we think that happens and what we can do about it i want to show you how it feels for my patients
so imagine if you will that im stroking your arm with this feather as im stroking my arm right now
now i want you to imagine that im stroking it with this
please keep your seat
a very different feeling
now what does it have to do with chronic pain
imagine if you will these two ideas together
imagine what your life would be like if i were to stroke it with this feather but your brain was telling you that this is what you are feeling and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain
in fact imagine something even worse
imagine i were to stroke your childs arm with this feather and their brain telling them that they were feeling this hot torch
that was the experience of my patient chandler whom you see in the photograph
as you can see shes a beautiful young woman
she was years old last year when i met her and she aspired to be a professional dancer
and during the course of one of her dance rehearsals she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist
now you would probably imagine as she did that a wrist sprain is a trivial event in a persons life
wrap it in an ace bandage take some ibuprofen for a week or two and thats the end of the story
but in chandlers case that was the beginning of the story
this is what her arm looked like when she came to my clinic about three months after her sprain
you can see that the arm is discolored purplish in color
it was cadaverically cold to the touch
the muscles were frozen paralyzed dystonic is how we refer to that
the pain had spread from her wrist to her hands to her fingertips from her wrist up to her elbow almost all the way to her shoulder
but the worst part was not the spontaneous pain that was there hours a day
the worst part was that she had allodynia the medical term for the phenomenon that i just illustrated with the feather and with the torch
the lightest touch of her arm the touch of a hand the touch even of a sleeve of a garment as she put it on caused excruciating burning pain
how can the nervous system get this so wrong
how can the nervous system misinterpret an innocent sensation like the touch of a hand and turn it into the malevolent sensation of the touch of the flame
well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hardwired like your house
in your house wires run in the wall from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb
and when you turn the switch on the light goes on
and when you turn the switch off the light goes off
so people imagine the nervous system is just like that
if you hit your thumb with a hammer these wires in your arm that of course we call nerves transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord where new wires new nerves take the information up to the brain where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt
but the situation of course in the human body is far more complicated than that
instead of it being the case that that junction box in the spinal cord is just simple where one nerve connects with the next nerve by releasing these little brown packets of chemical information called neurotransmitters in a linear one on one fashion in fact what happens is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions laterally vertically up and down in the spinal cord and they start interacting with other adjacent cells
these cells called glial cells were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together like the nerves
but it turns out the glial cells have a vital role in the modulation amplification and in the case of pain the distortion of sensory experiences
these glial cells become activated
their dna starts to synthesize new proteins which spill out and interact with adjacent nerves and they start releasing their neurotransmitters and those neurotransmitters spill out and activate adjacent glial cells and so on and so forth until what we have is a positive feedback loop
its almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your walls so that the next time you turned on the light switch the toilet flushed three doors down or your dishwasher went on or your computer monitor turned off
thats crazy but thats in fact what happens with chronic pain
and thats why pain becomes its own disease
the nervous system has plasticity
it changes and it morphs in response to stimuli
well what do we do about that
what can we do in a case like chandlers
we treat these patients in a rather crude fashion at this point in time
we treat them with symptom modifying drugs painkillers which are frankly not very effective for this kind of pain
we take nerves that are noisy and active that should be quiet and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics
and most importantly what we do is we use a rigorous and often uncomfortable process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life
and we support all of that with an intensive psychotherapy program to address the despondency despair and depression that always accompanies severe chronic pain
its successful as you can see from this video of chandler who two months after we first met her is now doings a back flip
and i had lunch with her yesterday because shes a college student studying dance at long beach here and shes doing absolutely fantastic
but the future is actually even brighter
the future holds the promise that new drugs will be developed that are not symptom modifying drugs that simply mask the problem as we have now but that will be disease modifying drugs that will actually go right to the root of the problem and attack those glial cells or those pernicious proteins that the glial cells elaborate that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind up or plasticity that so is capable of distorting and amplifying the sensory experience that we call pain
so i have hope that in the future the prophetic words of george carlin will be realized who said my philosophy no pain no pain
thank you very much

description ted talk subtitles and transcript kristina gjerde studies the law of the high seas the percent of our ocean that isnt protected by any national law at all gorgeous photos show the hidden worlds that gjerde and other lawyers are working to protect from trawling and trash dumping through smart policymaking and a healthy dose of pr description
today im going to take you on a voyage to some place so deep so dark so unexplored that we know less about it than we know about the dark side of the moon
its a place of myth and legend
its a place marked on ancient maps as here be monsters
it is a place where each new voyage of exploration brings back new discoveries of creatures so wondrous and strange that our forefathers would have considered them monstrous indeed
instead they just make me green with envy that my colleague from iucn was able to go on this journey to the south of madagascar seamounts to actually take photographs and to see these wondrous creatures of the deep
we are talking about the high seas
the high seas is a legal term but in fact it covers percent of the planet
with an average depth of the oceans of meters in fact the high seas covers and provides nearly percent of the habitat for life on this earth
it is in theory the global commons belonging to us all
but in reality it is managed by and for those who have the resources to go out and exploit it
so today im going to take you on a voyage to cast light on some of the outdated myths and legends and assumptions that have kept us as the true stakeholders in the high seas in the dark
were going to voyage to some of these special places that weve been discovering in the past few years to show why we really need to care
and then finally were going to try to develop and pioneer a new perspective on high seas governance thats rooted in ocean basin wide conservation but framed in an arena of global norms of precaution and respect
so here is a picture of the high seas as seen from above that area in the darker blue
to me as an international lawyer this scared me far more than any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen for it belies the notion that you can actually protect the ocean the global ocean that provides us all with carbon storage with heat storage with oxygen if you can only protect percent
this is indeed the true heart of the planet
some of the problems that we have to confront are that the current international laws for example shipping provide more protection to the areas closest to shore
for example garbage discharge something you would think just simply goes away but the laws regulating ship discharge of garbage actually get weaker the further you are from shore
as a result we have garbage patches the size of twice texas
its unbelievable
we used to think the solution to pollution was dilution but that has proved to be no longer the case
so what we have learned from social scientists and economists like elinor ostrom who are studying the phenomenon of management of the commons on a local scale is that there are certain prerequisites that you can put into place that enable you to manage and access open space for the good of one and all
and these include a sense of shared responsibility common norms that bind people together as a community
conditional access you can invite people in but they have to be able to play by the rules
and of course if you want people to play by the rules you still need an effective system of monitoring and enforcement for as weve discovered you can trust but you also need to verify
what id also like to convey is that it is not all doom and gloom that we are seeing in the high seas
for a group of very dedicated individuals scientists conservationists photographers and states were able to actually change a tragic trajectory that was destroying fragile seascapes such as this coral garden that you see in front of you
that is were able to save it from a fate of deep sea bottom trawling
and how did we do that
well as i said we had a group of photographers that went out on board ships and actually photographed the activities in process
but we also spent many hours in the basements of the united nations trying to work with governments to make them understand what was going on so far away from land that few of us had ever even imagined that these creatures existed
so within three years from to we were able to get norm in place that actually changed the paradigm of how fishers went about deep sea bottom trawling
instead of go anywhere do anything you want we actually created a regime that required prior assessment of where youre going and a duty to prevent significant harm
in when the u n reviewed progress they discovered that almost million square kilometers of seabed had been protected
this does not mean that its the final solution or that this even provides permanent protection
but what it does mean is that a group of individuals can form a community to actually shape the way high seas are governed to create a new regime
so im looking optimistically at our opportunities for creating a true blue perspective for this beautiful planet
sylvias wish provides us with that leverage that access to the heart of human beings you might say who have rarely seen places beyond their own toes but are now hopefully going to become interested in the full life cycle of creatures like these sea turtles who indeed spend most of their time in the high seas
today were just going to voyage to a small sampling of some of these special areas just to give you an idea of the flavor of the riches and wonders they do contain
the sargasso sea for example is not a sea bounded by coastlines but it is bounded by oceanic currents that contain and envelope this wealth of sargassum that grows and aggregates there
its also known as the spawning ground for eels from northern european and northern american rivers that are now so dwindling in numbers that theyve actually stopped showing up in stockholm and five showed up in the u k just recently
but the sargasso sea the same way it aggregates sargassum weed actually is pulling in the plastic from throughout the region
this picture doesnt exactly show the plastics that i would like it to show because i havent been out there myself
but there has just been a study that was released in february that showed there are pieces of plastic per square kilometer now floating in the surface of the sargasso sea and that is affecting the habitat for the many species in their juvenile stages who come to the sargasso sea for its protection and its food
the sargasso sea is also a wondrous place for the aggregation of these unique species that have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat
it also provides a special habitat for these flying fish to lay their eggs
but what id like to get from this picture is that we truly do have an opportunity to launch a global initiative for protection
thus the government of bermuda has recognized the need and its responsibility as having some of the sargasso sea within its national jurisdiction but the vast majority is beyond to help spearhead a movement to achieve protection for this vital area
spinning down to someplace a little bit cooler than here right now the ross sea in the southern ocean
its actually a bay
its considered high seas because the continent has been put off limits to territorial claims
so anything in the water is treated as if its the high seas
but what makes the ross sea important is the vast sea of pack ice that in the spring and summer provides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill that supports what till recently has been a virtually intact near shore ecosystem
but unfortunately ccamlr the regional commission in charge of conserving and managing fish stocks and other living marine resources is unfortunately starting to give in to fishing interests and has authorized the expansion of toothfish fisheries in the region
the captain of a new zealand vessel who was just down there is reporting a significant decline in the number of the ross sea killer whales who are directly dependent on the antarctic toothfish as their main source of food
so what we need to do is to stand up boldly singly and together to push governments to push regional fisheries management organizations to declare our right to declare certain areas off limits to high seas fishing so that the freedom to fish no longer means the freedom to fish anywhere and anytime
coming closer to here the costa rica dome is a recently discovered area potentially year round habitat for blue whales
theres enough food there to last them the summer and the winter long
but whats unusual about the costa rica dome is in fact its not a permanent place
its an oceanographic phenomenon that shifts in time and space on a seasonal basis
so in fact its not permanently in the high seas
its not permanently in the exclusive economic zones of these five central american countries but it moves with the season
as such it does create a challenge to protect but we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it
we can use the same technologies that fishers use to identify where the species are in order to close the area when its most vulnerable which may in some cases be year round
getting closer to shore where we are this was in fact taken in the galapagos
many species are headed through this region which is why theres been so much attention put into conservation of the eastern tropical pacific seascape
this is the initiative thats been coordinated by conservation international with a variety of partners and governments to actually try to bring integrated management regime throughout the area
that is it provides a wonderful example of where you can go with a real regional initiative
its protecting five world heritage sites
unfortunately the world heritage convention does not recognize the need to protect areas beyond national jurisdiction at present
so a place like the costa rica dome could not technically qualify the time its in the high seas
so what weve been suggesting is that we either need to amend the world heritage convention so that it can adopt and urge universal protection of these world heritage sites or we need to change the name and call it half the world heritage convention
but what we also know is that species like these sea turtles do not stay put in the eastern tropical pacific seascape
these happen to go down to a vast south pacific gyre where they spend most of their time and often end up getting hooked like this or as bycatch
so what id really like to suggest is that we need to scale up
we need to work locally but we also need to work ocean basin wide
we have the tools and technologies now to enable us to take a broader ocean basin wide initiative
weve heard about the tagging of pacific predators project one of the census of marine life projects
its provided us data like this of tiny little sooty shearwaters that make the entire ocean basin their home
they fly kilometers in less than a year
so we have the tools and treasures coming from the census of marine life
and its culminating year thats going to be launched in october
so stay tuned for further information
what i find so exciting is that the census of marine life has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators its also looked in the really unexplored mid water column where creatures like this flying sea cucumber have been found
and fortunately weve been able as iucn to team up with the census of marine life and many of the scientists working there to actually try to translate much of this information to policymakers
we have the support of governments now behind us
weve been revealing this information through technical workshops
and the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information to move ahead to protect some of these significant hope spots hotspots
at the same time were saying yes we need more we need to move forward
but many of you have said if you get these marine protected areas or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place how are you going to enforce it
which leads me to my second passion besides ocean science which is outer space technology
i wanted to be an astronaut so ive constantly followed what are the tools available to monitor earth from outer space and that we have incredible tools like weve been learning about in terms of being able to follow tagged species throughout their life cycles in the open ocean
we can also tag and track fishing vessels
many already have transponders on board that allow us to find out where they are and even what theyre doing
but not all the vessels have those to date
it does not take too much rocket science to actually try to create new laws to mandate if youre going to have the privilege of accessing our high seas resources we need to know someone needs to know where you are and what youre doing
so it brings me to my main take home message which is we can avert a tragedy of the commons
we can stop the collision course of percent of the planet with the high seas
but we need to think broad scale we need to think globally
we need to change how we actually go about managing these resources
we need to get the new paradigm of precaution and respect
at the same time we need to think locally which is the joy and marvel of sylvias hope spot wish is that we can shine a spotlight on many of these previously unknown areas and to bring people to the table if you will to actually make them feel part of this community that truly has a stake in their future management
and third is that we need to look at ocean basin wide management
our species are ocean basin wide
many of the deep sea communities have genetic distribution that goes ocean basin wide
we need to better understand but we also need to start to manage and protect
and in order to do that you also need ocean basin management regimes
that is we have regional management regimes within the exclusive economic zone but we need to scale these up we need to build their capacity so theyre like the southern ocean where they do have the two pronged fisheries and conservation organization
so with that i would just like to sincerely thank and honor sylvia earle for her wish for it is helping us to put a face on the high seas and the deep seas beyond national jurisdiction
its helping to bring an incredible group of talented people together to really try to solve and penetrate these problems that have created our obstacles to management and rational use of this area that was once so far away and remote
so on this tour i hope i provided you with a new perspective of the high seas one that it is our home too and that we need to work together if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all
thank you

this is a great technology
we can take it completely for granted
but it wasnt always that way
even here in california if we were to go back just a few years it was a very different story
people were terrified of this disease
they were terrified of polio and it would cause public panic
and it was because of scenes like this
in this scene people are living in an iron lung
these are people who were perfectly healthy two or three days before and then two days later they can no longer breathe and this polio virus has paralyzed not only their arms and their legs but also their breathing muscles
and they were going to spend the rest of their lives usually in this iron lung to breathe for them
this disease was terrifying
there was no cure and there was no vaccine
the disease was so terrifying that the president of the united states launched an extraordinary national effort to find a way to stop it
twenty years later they succeeded and developed the polio vaccine
it was hailed as a scientific miracle in the late
finally a vaccine that could stop this awful disease and here in the united states it had an incredible impact
as you can see the virus stopped and it stopped very very fast
but this wasnt the case everywhere in the world
and it happened so fast in the united states however that even just last month jon stewart said this jon stewart where is polio still active
because i thought that had been eradicated in the way that smallpox had been eradicated
bruce aylward oops jon polios almost been eradicated
but the reality is that polio still exists today
we made this map for jon to try to show him exactly where polio still exists
this is the picture
theres not very much left in the world
but the reason theres not very much left is because theres been an extraordinary public private partnership working behind the scenes almost unknown im sure to most of you here today
its been working for years to try and eradicate this disease and its got it down to these few cases that you can see here on this graphic
but just last year we had an incredible shock and realized that almost just isnt good enough with a virus like polio
and this is the reason in two countries that hadnt had this disease for more than probably a decade on opposite sides of the globe there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks
hundreds of people were paralyzed
hundreds of people died children as well as adults
and in both cases we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries
they had come from thousands of miles away
and in one case it originated on another continent
and not only that but when they came into these countries then they got on commercial jetliners probably and they traveled even farther to other places like russia where for the first time in over a decade last year children were crippled and paralyzed by a disease that they had not seen for years
now all of these outbreaks that i just showed you these are under control now and it looks like theyll probably stop very very quickly
but the message was very clear
polio is still a devastating explosive disease
its just happening in another part of the world
and our big idea is that the scientific miracle of this decade should be the complete eradication of poliomyelitis
so i want to tell you a little bit about what this partnership the polio partnership is trying to do
were not trying to control polio
were not trying to get it down to just a few cases because this disease is like a root fire it can explode again if you dont snuff it out completely
so what were looking for is a permanent solution
we want a world in which every child just like you guys can take for granted a polio free world
so were looking for a permanent solution and this is where we get lucky
this is one of the very few viruses in the world where there are big enough cracks in its armor that we can try to do something truly extraordinary
this virus can only survive in people
it cant live for a very long time in people
it doesnt survive in the environment hardly at all
and weve got pretty good vaccines as ive just showed you
so we are trying to wipe out this virus completely
what the polio eradication program is trying to do is to kill the virus itself that causes polio everywhere on earth
now we dont have a great track record when it comes to doing something like this to eradicating diseases
its been tried six times in the last century and its been successful exactly once
and this is because disease eradication its still the venture capital of public health
the risks are massive but the pay off economic humanitarian motivational its absolutely huge
one congressman here in the united states thinks that the entire investment that the u s put into smallpox eradication pays itself off every days in foregone treatment costs and vaccination costs
and if we can finish polio eradication the poorest countries in the world are going to save over billion dollars in the next years alone
so those are the kind of stakes that were after
but smallpox eradication was hard it was very very hard
and polio eradication in many ways is even tougher and theres a few reasons for that
the first is that when we started trying to eradicate polio about years ago more than twice as many countries were infected than had been when we started off with smallpox
and there were more than times as many people living in these countries
so it was a massive effort
the second challenge we had was in contrast to the smallpox vaccine which was very stable and a single dose protected you for life the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile
it deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that weve had to put this special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when its exposed to too much heat and we can tell that its not a good vaccine to use on a child its not potent its not going to protect them
even then kids need many doses of the vaccine
but the third challenge we have and probably even bigger one the biggest challenge is that in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy every single person almost who was infected with smallpox had this telltale rash
so you could get around the disease you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off
with polio its almost completely different
the vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus show absolutely no sign of the disease
so you cant see the enemy most of the time and as a result weve needed a very different approach to eradicate polio than what was done with smallpox
weve had to create one of the largest social movements in history
theres over million people probably million people largely volunteers who have been working over the last years in what has now been called the largest internationally coordinated operation in peacetime
these people these million people vaccinate over million children every single year multiple times at the peak of our operation
now giving the polio vaccine is simple
its just two drops like that
but reaching million people is much much tougher
and these vaccinators these volunteers they have got to dive headlong into some of the toughest densest urban slums in the world
theyve got to trek under sweltering suns to some of the most remote difficult to reach places in the world
and they also have to dodge bullets because we have got to operate during shaky cease fires and truces to try and vaccinate children even in areas affected by conflict
one reporter who was watching our program in somalia about five years ago a place which has eradicated polio not once but twice because they got reinfected
he was sitting outside of the road watching one of these polio campaigns unfold and a few months later he wrote this is foreign aid at its most heroic
and these heroes they come from every walk of life all sorts of backgrounds
but one of the most extraordinary is rotary international
this is a group whose million strong army of volunteers have been working to eradicate polio for over years
theyre right at the center of the whole thing
now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication more than years much longer than it should have but once it was built the results were striking
within a couple of years every country that started polio eradication rapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses with the exception of four countries that you see here
and in each of those it was only part of the country
and then by one of the three polio viruses that we were trying to eradicate had been completely eradicated worldwide proof of concept
and then today theres been a percent reduction greater than percent reduction in the number of children who are being paralyzed by this awful disease
when we started over years ago children were being paralyzed every single day by this virus
last year it was
and at the same time the polio eradication program has been working to help with a lot of other areas
its been working to help control pandemic flu sars for example
its also tried to save children by doing other things giving vitamin a drops giving measles shots giving bed nets against malaria even during some of these campaigns
but the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us the international community to reach every single child every single community the most vulnerable people in the world with the most basic of health services irrespective of geography poverty culture and even conflict
so things were looking very exciting and then about five years ago this virus this ancient virus started to fight back
the first problem we ran into was that in these last four countries the strongholds of this virus we just couldnt seem to get the virus rooted out
and then to make the matters even worse the virus started to spread out of these four places especially northern india and northern nigeria into much of africa asia and even into europe causing horrific outbreaks in places that had not seen this disease for decades
and then in one of the most important tenacious and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world we found that our vaccine was working half as well as it should have
in conditions like this the vaccine just couldnt get the grip it needed to in the guts of these children and protect them the way that it needed to
now at that time there was a great as you can imagine frustration lets call it frustration it started to grow very very quickly
and all of a sudden some very important voices in the world of public health started to say hang on
we should abandon this idea of eradication
lets settle for control thats good enough
now as seductive as the idea of control sounds its a false premise
the brutal truth is if we dont have the will or the skill or even the money that we need to reach children the most vulnerable children in the world with something as simple as an oral polio vaccine then pretty soon more than children are again going to be paralyzed by this disease every single year
theres absolutely no question
these are children like umar
umar is seven years old and hes from northern nigeria
he lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and sisters
umar also has polio
umar was paralyzed for life
his right leg was paralyzed in
this leg his right leg now takes an awful beating because he has to half crawl because its faster to move that way to keep up with his friends keep up with his brothers and sisters than to get up on his crutches and walk
but umar is a fantastic student hes an incredible kid
as you probably cant see the detail here but this is his report card and youll see hes got perfect scores
he got percent in all the important things like nursery rhymes for example there
but you know id love to be able to tell you that umar is a typical kid with polio these days but its not true
umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances
the reality of polio today is something very different
polio strikes the poorest communities in the world
it leaves their children paralyzed and it drags their families deeper into poverty because theyre desperately searching and theyre desperately spending the little bit of savings that they have trying in vain to find a cure for their children
we think children deserve better
and so when the going got really tough in the polio eradication program about two years ago when people were saying we should call it off the polio partnership decided to buckle down once again and try and find innovative new solutions new ways to get to the children that we were missing again and again
in northern india we started mapping the cases using satellite imaging like this so that we could guide our investments and vaccinator shelters so we could get to the millions of children on the koshi river basin where there are no other health services
in northern nigeria the political leaders and the traditional muslim leaders they got directly involved in the program to help solve the problems of logistics and community confidence
and now theyve even started using these devices speaking of cool technology these little devices little gis trackers like this which they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccinators
and then they can track them and at the end of the day they look and see did these guys get every single street every single house
this is the kind of commitment now were seeing to try and reach all of the children weve been missing
and in afghanistan were trying new approaches access negotiators
were working closely with the international committee of the red cross to ensure that we can reach every child
but as we tried these extraordinary things as people went to this trouble to try and rework their tactics we went back to the vaccine its a year old vaccine and we thought surely we can make a better vaccine so that when they finally get to these kids we can have a better bang for our buck
and this started an incredible collaboration with industry and within six months we were testing a new polio vaccine that targeted just two years ago the last two types of polio in the world
now june the ninth we got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine and it turned out to be a game changer
the new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had and we immediately started using this
well in a couple of months we had to get it out of production
and it started rolling off the production lines and into the mouths of children around the world
and we didnt start with the easy places
the first place this vaccine was used was in southern afghanistan because its in places like that where kids are going to benefit the most from technologies like this
now here at ted over the last couple of days ive seen people challenging the audience again and again to believe in the impossible
so this morning at about seven oclock i decided that wed try to drive chris and the production crew here berserk by downloading all of our data from india again so that you could see something thats just unfolding today which proves that the impossible is possible
and only two years ago people were saying that this is impossible
now remember northern india is the perfect storm when it comes to polio
over children are born in the two states that have never stopped polio uttar pradesh and bihar children every single month
sanitation is terrible and our old vaccine you remember worked half as well as it should have
and yet the impossible is happening
today marks exactly six months and for the first time in history not a single child has been paralyzed in uttar pradesh or bihar
indias not unique
in umars home country of nigeria a percent reduction in the number of children paralyzed by polio last year
and in the last six months weve had less places reinfected by polio than at any other time in history
ladies and gentlemen with a combination of smart people smart technology and smart investments polio can now be eradicated anywhere
we have major challenges you can imagine to finish this job but as youve also seen its doable it has great secondary benefits and polio eradication is a great buy
and as long as any child anywhere is paralyzed by this virus its a stark reminder that we are failing as a society to reach children with the most basic of services
and for that reason polio eradication its the ultimate in equity and its the ultimate in social justice
the huge social movement thats been involved in polio eradication is ready to do way more for these children
its ready to reach them with bed nets with other things
but capitalizing on their enthusiasm capitalizing on their energy means finishing the job that they started years ago
finishing polio is a smart thing to do and its the right thing to do
now were in tough times economically
but as david cameron of the united kingdom said about a month ago when he was talking about polio theres never a wrong time to do the right thing
finishing polio eradication is the right thing to do
and we are at a crossroads right now in this great effort over the last years
we have a new vaccine we have new resolve and we have new tactics
we have the chance to write an entirely new polio free chapter in human history
but if we blink now we will lose forever the chance to eradicate an ancient disease
heres a great idea to spread end polio now
help us tell the story
help us build the momentum so that very soon every child every parent everywhere can also take for granted a polio free life forever
thank you
bill gates well bruce where do you think the toughest places are going to be
where would you say we need to be the smartest
ba the four places where you saw that weve never stopped northern nigeria northern india the southern corner of afghanistan and bordering areas of pakistan theyre going to be the toughest
but the interesting thing is of those three indias looking real good as you just saw in the data
and afghanistan afghanistan we think has probably stopped polio repeatedly
it keeps getting reinfected
so the tough ones going to get the top of nigeria finished and getting pakistan finished
theyre going to be the tough ones
bg now what about the money
give us a sense of how much the campaign costs a year
and is it easy to raise that money
and whats it going to be like the next couple of years
ba its interesting
we spend right now about million to million dollars a year
thats what it costs to reach million children
it sounds like a lot of money it is a lot of money
but when youre reaching million children multiple times cents to reach a child thats not very much money
but right now we dont have enough of that
we have a big gap in that money were cutting corners and every time we cut corners more places get infected that shouldnt have and it just slows us down
and that great buy costs us a little bit more
bg well hopefully well get the word out and the governments will keep their generosity up
so good luck were all in this with you
thank you

title tony porter a call to men title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript at tedwomen tony porter makes a call to men everywhere dont act like a man telling powerful stories from his own life he shows how this mentality drummed into so many men and boys can lead men to disrespect mistreat and abuse women and each other his solution break free of the man box description
i grew up in new york city between harlem and the bronx
growing up as a boy we were taught that men had to be tough had to be strong had to be courageous dominating no pain no emotions with the exception of anger and definitely no fear that men are in charge which means women are not that men lead and you should just follow and do what we say that men are superior women are inferior that men are strong women are weak that women are of less value property of men and objects particularly sexual objects
ive later come to know that to be the collective socialization of men better known as the man box
see this man box has in it all the ingredients of how we define what it means to be a man
now i also want to say without a doubt there are some wonderful wonderful absolutely wonderful things about being a man
but at the same time theres some stuff thats just straight up twisted and we really need to begin to challenge look at it and really get in the process of deconstructing redefining what we come to know as manhood
this is my two at home kendall and jay
theyre and
kendalls months older than jay
there was a period of time when my wife her name is tammie and i we just got real busy and whip bam boom kendall and jay
and when they were about five and six four and five jay could come to me come to me crying
it didnt matter what she was crying about she could get on my knee she could snot my sleeve up just cry cry it out
daddys got you thats all thats important
now kendall on the other hand and like i said hes only months older than her hed come to me crying its like as soon as i would hear him cry a clock would go off
i would give the boy probably about seconds which means by the time he got to me i was already saying things like why are you crying
hold your head up look at me
explain to me whats wrong
tell me whats wrong i cant understand you
why are you crying
and out of my own frustration of my role and responsibility of building him up as a man to fit into these guidelines and these structures that are defining this man box i would find myself saying things like just go in your room
just go on go on in your room
sit down get yourself together and come back and talk to me when you can talk to me like a what
like a man
and hes five years old
and as i grow in life i would say to myself my god whats wrong with me
what am i doing why would i do this
and i think back
i think back to my father
there was a time in my life where we had a very troubled experience in our family
my brother henry he died tragically when we were teenagers
we lived in new york city as i said
we lived in the bronx at the time and the burial was in a place called long island it was about two hours outside of the city
and as we were preparing to come back from the burial the cars stopped at the bathroom to let folks take care of themselves before the long ride back to the city
and the limousine empties out
my mother my sister my auntie they all get out but my father and i stayed in the limousine and no sooner than the women got out he burst out crying
he didnt want cry in front of me but he knew he wasnt going to make it back to the city and it was better me than to allow himself to express these feelings and emotions in front of the women
and this is a man who minutes ago in the ground something i just cant even imagine
the thing that sticks with me the most is that he was apologizing to me for crying in front of me and at the same time he was also giving me props lifting me up for not crying
i come to also look at this as this fear that we have as men this fear that just has us paralyzed holding us hostage to this man box
i can remember speaking to a year old boy a football player and i asked him i said how would you feel if in front of all the players your coach told you you were playing like a girl
now i expected him to say something like id be sad id be mad id be angry or something like that
no the boy said to me the boy said to me it would destroy me
and i said to myself god if it would destroy him to be called a girl what are we then teaching him about girls
it took me back to a time when i was about years old
i grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city
at this time were living in the bronx and in the building next to where i lived there was a guy named johnny
he was about years old and we were all about years old younger guys
and he was hanging out with all us younger guys
and this guy he was up to a lot of no good
he was the kind of kid who parents would have to wonder what is this year old boy doing with these year old boys
and he did spend a lot of time up to no good
he was a troubled kid
his mother had died from a heroin overdose
he was being raised by his grandmother
his father wasnt on the set
his grandmother had two jobs
he was home alone a lot
but ive got to tell you we young guys we looked up to this dude man
he was cool he was fine
thats what the sisters said he was fine
he was having sex
we all looked up to him
so one day im out in front of the house doing something just playing around doing something i dont know what
he looks out his window he calls me upstairs he said hey anthony
they called me anthony growing up as a kid
hey anthony come on upstairs
johnny call you go
so i run right upstairs
as he opens the door he says to me do you want some
now i immediately knew what he meant
because for me growing up at that time and our relationship with this man box do you want some meant one of two things sex or drugs and we werent doing drugs
now my box my card my man box card was immediately in jeopardy
two things one i never had sex
we dont talk about that as men
you only tell your dearest closest friend sworn to secrecy for life the first time you had sex
for everybody else we go around like weve been having sex since we were two
there aint no first time
the other thing i couldnt tell him is that i didnt want any
thats even worse were supposed to always be on the prowl
women are objects especially sexual objects
anyway so i couldnt tell him any of that
so like my mother would say make a long story short i just simply said to johnny yes
he told me to go in his room
i go in his room on his bed is a girl from the neighborhood named sheila
shes years old
shes nude
shes what i know today to be mentally ill higher functioning at times than others
we had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her
anyway johnny had just gotten through having sex with her
well actually he raped her but he would say he had sex with her
because while sheila never said no she also never said yes
so he was offering me the opportunity to do the same
so when i go in the room i close the door
folks im petrified
i stand with my back to the door so johnny cant bust in the room and see that im not doing anything and i stand there long enough that i could have actually done something
so now im no longer trying to figure out what im going to do im trying to figure out how im going to get out of this room
so in my years of wisdom i zip my pants down i walk out into the room and lo and behold to me while i was in the room with sheila johnny was back at the window calling guys up
so now theres a living room full of guys
it was like the waiting room in the doctors office
and they asked me how was it and i say to them it was good and i zip my pants up in front of them and i head for the door
now i say this all with remorse and i was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time but i was conflicted because while i was feeling remorse i was excited because i didnt get caught
but i knew i felt bad about what was happening
this fear getting outside the man box totally enveloped me
it was way more important to me about me and my man box card than about sheila and what was happening to her
see collectively we as men are taught to have less value in women to view them as property and the objects of men
we see that as an equation that equals violence against women
we as men good men the large majority of men we operate on the foundation of this whole collective socialization
we kind of see ourselves separate but were very much a part of it
you see we have to come to understand that less value property and objectification is the foundation and the violence cant happen without it
so were very much a part of the solution as well as the problem
the center for disease control says that mens violence against women is at epidemic proportions is the number one health concern for women in this country and abroad
so quickly id like to just say this is the love of my life my daughter jay
the world i envision for her how do i want men to be acting and behaving
i need you on board i need you with me
i need you working with me and me working with you on how we raise our sons and teach them to be men that its okay to not be dominating that its okay to have feelings and emotions that its okay to promote equality that its okay to have women who are just friends and thats it that its okay to be whole that my liberation as a man is tied to your liberation as a woman
i remember asking a nine year old boy i asked a nine year old boy what would life be like for you if you didnt have to adhere to this man box
he said to me i would be free
thank you folks

description ted talk subtitles and transcript four star general stanley mcchrystal shares what he learned about leadership over his decades in the military how can you build a sense of shared purpose among people of many ages and skill sets by listening and learning and addressing the possibility of failure description
ten years ago on a tuesday morning i conducted a parachute jump at fort bragg north carolina
it was a routine training jump like many more id done since i became a paratrooper years before
we went down to the airfield early because this is the army and you always go early
you do some routine refresher training and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you
and you put on the t parachute
and youre very careful how you put the straps particularly the leg straps because they go between your legs
and then you put on your reserve and then you put on your heavy rucksack
and then a jumpmaster comes and hes an experienced nco in parachute operations
he checks you out he grabs your adjusting straps and he tightens everything so that your chest is crushed your shoulders are crushed down and of course hes tightened so your voice goes up a couple octaves as well
then you sit down and you wait a little while because this is the army
then you load the aircraft and then you stand up and you get on and you kind of lumber to the aircraft like this in a line of people and you sit down on canvas seats on either side of the aircraft
and you wait a little bit longer because this is the air force teaching the army how to wait
then you take off
and its painful enough now and i think its designed this way its painful enough so you want to jump
you didnt really want to jump but you want out
so you get in the aircraft youre flying along and at minutes out these jumpmasters start giving you commands
they give minutes thats a time warning
you sit there ok
then they give you minutes
and of course youre responding with all of these
and thats to boost everybodys confidence to show that youre not scared
then they give you get ready
then they go outboard personnel stand up
if youre an outboard personnel now you stand up
if youre an inboard personnel stand up
and then you hook up and you hook up your static line
and at that point you think hey guess what
im probably going to jump
theres no way to get out of this at this point
you go through some additional checks and then they open the door
and this was that tuesday morning in september and it was pretty nice outside
so nice air comes flowing in
the jumpmasters start to check the door
and then when its time to go a green light goes and the jumpmaster goes go
the first guy goes and youre just in line and you just kind of lumber to the door
jump is a misnomer you fall
you fall outside the door youre caught in the slipstream
the first thing you do is lock into a tight body position head down in your chest your arms extended put over your reserve parachute
you do that because years before an airborne sergeant had taught me to do that
i have no idea whether it makes any difference but he seemed to make sense and i wasnt going to test the hypothesis that hed be wrong
and then you wait for the opening shock for your parachute to open
if you dont get an opening shock you dont get a parachute youve got a whole new problem set
but typically you do typically it opens
and of course if your leg straps arent set right at that point you get another little thrill
boom
so then you look around youre under a canopy and you say this is good
now you prepare for the inevitable
you are going to hit the ground
you cant delay that much
and you really cant decide where you hit very much because they pretend you can steer but youre being delivered
so you look around where youre going to land you try to make yourself ready
and then as you get close you lower your rucksack below you on a lowering line so that its not on you when you land and you prepare to do a parachute landing fall
now the army teaches you to do five points of performance the toes of your feet your calves your thighs your buttocks and your push up muscles
its this elegant little land twist and roll
and thats not going to hurt
in some years of jumping i never did one
i always landed like a watermelon out of a third floor window
and as soon as i hit the first thing i did is id see if id broken anything that i needed
id shake my head and id ask myself the eternal question why didnt i go into banking
and id look around and then id see another paratrooper a young guy or girl and theyd have pulled out their carbine and theyd be picking up their equipment
theyd be doing everything that we had taught them
and i realized that if they had to go into combat they would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders
and i realized that if they came out of combat it would be because we led them well
and i was hooked again on the importance of what i did
so now i do that tuesday morning jump but its not any jump that was september
and when we took off from the airfield america was at peace
when we landed on the drop zone everything had changed
and what we thought about the possibility of those young soldiers going into combat as being theoretical was now very very real and leadership seemed important
but things had changed i was a year old brigadier general
id been successful but things changed so much that i was going to have to make some significant changes and on that morning i didnt know it
i was raised with traditional stories of leadership robert e lee john buford at gettysburg
and i also was raised with personal examples of leadership
this was my father in vietnam
and i was raised to believe that soldiers were strong and wise and brave and faithful they didnt lie cheat steal or abandon their comrades
and i still believe real leaders are like that
but in my first years of career i had a bunch of different experiences
one of my first battalion commanders i worked in his battalion for months and the only conversation he ever had with lt mcchrystal was at mile of a mile road march and he chewed my ass for about seconds
and im not sure that was real interaction
but then a couple of years later when i was a company commander i went out to the national training center
and we did an operation and my company did a dawn attack you know the classic dawn attack you prepare all night move to the line of departure
and i had an armored organization at that point
we move forward and we get wiped out i mean wiped out immediately
the enemy didnt break a sweat doing it
and after the battle they bring this mobile theater and they do what they call an after action review to teach you what youve done wrong
sort of leadership by humiliation
they put a big screen up and they take you through everything and then you didnt do this and you didnt do this etc
i walked out feeling as low and i saw my battalion commander because i had let him down
and i went up to apologize to him and he said stanley i thought you did great
and in one sentence he lifted me put me back on my feet and taught me that leaders can let you fail and yet not let you be a failure
when came year old brig gen mcchrystal sees a whole new world
first the things that are obvious that youre familiar with the environment changed the speed the scrutiny the sensitivity of everything now is so fast sometimes it evolves faster than people have time to really reflect on it
but everything we do is in a different context
more importantly the force that i led was spread over more than countries
and instead of being able to get all the key leaders for a decision together in a single room and look them in the eye and build their confidence and get trust from them im now leading a force thats dispersed and ive got to use other techniques
ive got to use video teleconferences ive got to use chat ive got to use email ive got to use phone calls ive got to use everything i can not just for communication but for leadership
a year old individual operating alone thousands of miles from me has got to communicate to me with confidence
i have to have trust in them and vice versa
and i also have to build their faith
and thats a new kind of leadership for me
we had one operation where we had to coordinate it from multiple locations
an emerging opportunity came didnt have time to get everybody together
so we had to get complex intelligence together we had to line up the ability to act
it was sensitive we had to go up the chain of command convince them that this was the right thing to do and do all of this on electronic medium
we failed
the mission didnt work
and so now what we had to do is i had to reach out to try to rebuild the trust of that force rebuild their confidence me and them and them and me and our seniors and us as a force all without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder
entirely new requirement
also the people had changed
you probably think that the force that i led was all steely eyed commandos with big knuckle fists carrying exotic weapons
in reality much of the force i led looked exactly like you
it was men women young old not just from military from different organizations many of them detailed to us just from a handshake
and so instead of giving orders youre now building consensus and youre building a sense of shared purpose
probably the biggest change was understanding that the generational difference the ages had changed so much
i went down to be with a ranger platoon on an operation in afghanistan and on that operation a sergeant in the platoon had lost about half his arm throwing a taliban hand grenade back at the enemy after it had landed in his fire team
we talked about the operation and then at the end i did what i often do with a force like that
i asked where were you on
and one young ranger in the back his hairs tousled and his face is red and windblown from being in combat in the cold afghan wind he said sir i was in the sixth grade
and it reminded me that were operating a force that must have shared purpose and shared consciousness and yet he has different experiences in many cases a different vocabulary a completely different skill set in terms of digital media than i do and many of the other senior leaders
and yet we need to have that shared sense
it also produced something which i call an inversion of expertise because we had so many changes at the lower levels in technology and tactics and whatnot that suddenly the things that we grew up doing wasnt what the force was doing anymore
so how does a leader stay credible and legitimate when they havent done what the people youre leading are doing
and its a brand new leadership challenge
and it forced me to become a lot more transparent a lot more willing to listen a lot more willing to be reverse mentored from lower
and yet again youre not all in one room
then another thing
theres an effect on you and on your leaders
theres an impact its cumulative
you dont reset or recharge your battery every time
i stood in front of a screen one night in iraq with one of my senior officers and we watched a firefight from one of our forces
and i remembered his son was in our force
and i said john wheres your son and how is he
and he said sir hes fine thanks for asking
i said where is he now
and he pointed at the screen he said hes in that firefight
think about watching your brother father daughter son wife in a firefight in real time and you cant do anything about it
think about knowing that over time
and its a new cumulative pressure on leaders
and you have to watch and take care of each other
i probably learned the most about relationships
i learned they are the sinew which hold the force together
i grew up much of my career in the ranger regiment
and every morning in the ranger regiment every ranger and there are more than of them says a six stanza ranger creed
you may know one line of it it says ill never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy
and its not a mindless mantra and its not a poem
its a promise
every ranger promises every other ranger no matter what happens no matter what it costs me if you need me im coming
and every ranger gets that same promise from every other ranger
think about it its extraordinarily powerful
its probably more powerful than marriage vows
and theyve lived up to it which gives it special power
and so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing
and i learned personal relationships were more important than ever
we were in a difficult operation in afghanistan in and an old friend of mine that i had spent many years at various points of my career with godfather to one of their kids he sent me a note just in an envelope that had a quote from sherman to grant that said i knew if i ever got in a tight spot that you would come if alive
and having that kind of relationship for me turned out to be critical at many points in my career
and i learned that you have to give that in this environment because its tough
that was my journey
i hope its not over
i came to believe that a leader isnt good because theyre right theyre good because theyre willing to learn and to trust
this isnt easy stuff
its not like that electronic abs machine where minutes a month you get washboard abs
and it isnt always fair
you can get knocked down and it hurts and it leaves scars
but if youre a leader the people youve counted on will help you up
and if youre a leader the people who count on you need you on your feet
thank you

title arunachalam muruganantham how i started a sanitary napkin revolution title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript when he realized his wife had to choose between buying family meals and buying her monthly supplies arunachalam muruganantham vowed to help her solve the problem of the sanitary pad his research got very very personal and led him to a powerful business model description
so i tried to do a small good thing for my wife
it makes me to stand here the fame the money i got out of it
so what i did id gone back to my early marriage days
what you did in the early marriage days you tried to impress your wife i did the same
on that occasion i found my wife carrying something like this
i saw what is that i asked
my wife replied none of your business
then being her husband i ran behind her and saw she had a nasty rag cloth
i dont even use that cloth to clean my two wheeler
then i understood this adapting that unhygienic method to manage her period days
then i immediately asked her why are you that unhygienic method
she replied i also know about but myself and my sisters if they start using that we have to cut our family milk budget
then i was shocked what is the connection between using a sanitary pad and a milk budget
and its called affordability
i tried to impress my new wife by offering her a packet of sanitary pads
i went to a local shop i tried to buy her a sanitary pad packet
that fellow looks left and right and spreads a newspaper rolls it into the newspaper gives it to me like a banned item something like that
i dont know why i did not ask for a condom
then i took that pad i want to see that what is inside it
the very first time at the age of that day i am touching the sanitary pad first ever
i must know how many of the guys here have touched a sanitary pad
they are not going to touch that because its not your matter
then i thought to myself white substance made of cotton oh my god that guy is just using a penny value of raw material inside they are selling for pounds dollars
why not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife
thats how all this started but after making a sanitary pad where can i check it
its not like i can just check it in the lab
i need a woman volunteer where can i get one in india
even in bangalore you wont get in india
so only problem the only available victim is my wife
then i made a sanitary pad and handed it to shanti my wifes name is shanti
close your eyes whatever i give it will be not a diamond pendant not a diamond ring even a chocolate i will give you a surprise with a lot of tinsel paper rolled up with it
close your eyes
because i tried to make it intimate
because its an arranged marriage not a love marriage
so one day she said openly im not going to support this research
then other victims they got into my sisters
but even sisters wives theyre not ready to support in the research
thats why i am always jealous with the saints in india
they are having a lot of women volunteers around them
why i am not getting
you know without them even calling theyll get a lot of women volunteers
then i used tried to use the medical college girls
they also refused finally i decide use sanitary pad myself
now i am having a title like the first man to set foot on the moon
armstrong then tenzing hillary in everest like that muruganantham is the first man wore a sanitary pad across the globe
i wore a sanitary pad i filled animal blood in a football bottle i tied it up here there is a tube going into my panties while im walking while im cycling i made a press doses of blood will go there
that makes me bow down to any woman in front of me to give full respect that five days ill never forget the messy days the lousy days that wetness
my god its unbelievable
but here the problem is one company is making napkin out of cotton it is working well
but i am also trying to make sanitary pad with the good cotton its not working
that makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research
you need first funds
not only financial crises but because of the sanitary pad research i come through all sorts of problems including a divorce notice from my wife
why is this i used medical college girls
she suspects i am using as a trump card to run behind medical college girls
finally i came to know it is a special cellulose derived from a pinewood but even after that you need a multimillion dollar plant like this to process that material again a stop up
then i spend another four years to create my own machine tools a simple machine tool like this
in this machine any rural woman can apply the same raw materials that they are processing in the multinational plant anyone can make a world class napkin at your dining hall
that is my invention
so after that what i did usually if anyone got a patent or an invention immediately you want to make convert into this
i never did this i dropped it just like this because you do this if anyone runs after money their life will not any beauty it is boredom
a lot of people making a lot of money billion billions of dollars accumulating
why are they coming for finally for philanthropy
why the need for accumulating money then doing philanthropy
what if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one
thats why i am giving this machine only in rural india for rural women because in india surprised only two percent of women are using sanitary pads the rest theyre using a rag cloth a leaf husk dust everything except sanitary pads
it is the same in the century thats why i am going to decide to give this machine only for poor women across india
so far installations happened in states in six other countries
now im on my seventh year sustaining against multinational transnational giants makes all mba students a question mark
a school dropout from coimbatore how he is able to sustaining
that makes me a visiting professor and guest lecturer in all iims
play video one
arunachalam muruganantham the thing i saw in my wifes hand why are you using that nasty cloth
she replied immediately i know about napkins but if i start using napkins then we have to cut our family milk budget
why not make myself a low cost napkin
so i decided im going to sell this new machine only for women self help groups
that is my idea
am and previously you need a multimillion investment for machine and all now any rural woman can
they are performing puja
you just think competing giants even from harvard oxford is difficult
i make a rural woman to compete with multinationals
im sustaining on seventh year
already installations what is my mission
im going to make india a percent sanitary napkin using country in my lifetime
in this way im going to provide not less than a million rural employment that im going to create
thats why im not running after this bloody money
im doing something serious
if you chase a girl the girl wont like you
do your job simply the girl will chase you
like that i never chased mahalakshmi
mahalakshmi is chasing me i am keeping in the back pocket
not in front pocket im a back pocket man
thats all a school dropout saw your problem in the society of not using sanitary pad
i am becoming a solution provider im very happy
i dont want to make this as a corporate entity
i want to make this as a local sanitary pad movement across the globe thats why i put all the details on public domain like an open software
now countries are accessing it okay
so i classify the people into three uneducated little educated surplus educated
little educated done this surplus educated what are you going to do for the society
thank you very much bye

title amanda bennett we need a heroic narrative for death title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript amanda bennett and her husband were passionate and full of life all throughout their lives together and up until the final days too bennett gives a sweet yet powerful talk on why for the loved ones of the dying having hope for a happy ending shouldnt warrant a diagnosis of denial she calls for a more heroic narrative for death to match the ones we have in life description
so id like you to come back with me just for a few minutes to a dark night in china the night i met my husband
it was a city so long ago that it was still called peking
so i went to a party
i sat down next to a stout middle aged man with owl glasses and a bow tie and he turned out to be a fulbright scholar there in china specifically to study sino soviet relations
what a gift it was to the eager young foreign correspondent that i was then
id pump him for information im mentally scribbling notes for the stories i plan to write
i talk to him for hours
only months later i discover who he really was
he was the china representative for the american soybean association
i dont understand soybeans
you told me you were a fulbright scholar
well how long would you have talked to me if i told you were in soybeans
i said you jerk
only jerk wasnt the word i used
i said you couldve gotten me fired
and he said lets get married
travel the world and have lots of kids
so we did
and what an alive man terence bryan foley turned out to be
he was a chinese scholar who later in his got a ph d in chinese history
he spoke six languages he played musical instruments he was a licensed pilot he had once been a san francisco cable car operator he was an expert in swine nutrition dairy cattle dixieland jazz film noir and we did travel the country and the world and we did have a lot of kids
we followed my job and it seemed like there was nothing that we couldnt do
so when we found the cancer it doesnt seem strange to us at all that without saying a word to each other we believed that if we were smart enough and strong enough and brave enough and we worked hard enough we could keep him from dying ever
and for years it seemed like we were succeeding
the surgeon emerged from the surgery
whatd he say he said what surgeons always say we got it all
then there was a setback when the pathologists looked at the kidney cancer closely
it turned out to be a rare exceedingly aggressive type with a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal in several weeks at most
and yet he did not die
mysteriously he lived on
he coached little league for our son
he built a playhouse for our daughter
and meanwhile im burying myself in the internet looking for specialists
im looking for a cure
so a year goes by before the cancer as cancers do reappears and with it comes another death sentence this time nine months
so we try another treatment aggressive nasty
it makes him so sick he has to quit it yet still he lives on
then another year goes by
two years go by
more specialists
we take the kids to italy
we take the kids to australia
and then more years pass and the cancer begins to grow
this time theres new treatments on the horizon
theyre exotic theyre experimental
theyre going to attack the cancer in new ways
so he enters a clinical trial and it works
the cancer begins to shrink and for the third time weve dodged death
so now i ask you how do i feel when the time finally comes and theres another dark night sometime between midnight and a m
this time its on the intensive care ward when a twentysomething resident that ive never met before tells me that terence is dying perhaps tonight
so what do i say when he says what do you want me to do
theres another drug out there
its newer its more powerful
he started it just two weeks ago
perhaps theres still hope ahead
so what do i say
i say keep him alive if you can
and terence died six days later
so we fought we struggled we triumphed
it was an exhilarating fight and id repeat the fight today without a moments hesitation
we fought together we lived together
it turned what could have been seven of the grimmest years of our life into seven of the most glorious
it was also an expensive fight
it was the kind of fight and the kind of choices that everyone here agrees pump up the cost of end of life care and of healthcare for all of us
and for me for us we pushed the fight right over the edge and i never got the chance to say to him what i say to him now almost every day hey buddy it was a hell of a ride
we never got the chance to say goodbye
we never thought it was the end
we always had hope
so what do we make of all of this
being a journalist after terence died i wrote a book the cost of hope
i wrote it because i wanted to know why i did what i did why he did what he did why everyone around us did what they did
and what did i discover
well one of the things i discovered is that experts think that one answer to what i did at the end was a piece of paper the advance directive to help families get past the seemingly irrational choices
yet i had that piece of paper
we both did
and they were readily available
i had them right at hand
both of them said the same thing do nothing if there is no further hope
i knew terences wishes as clearly and as surely as i knew my own
yet we never got to no further hope
even with that clear cut paper in our hands we just kept redefining hope
i believed i could keep him from dying and id be embarrassed to say that if i hadnt seen so many people and have talked to so many people who have felt exactly the same way
right up until days before his death i felt strongly and powerfully and you might say irrationally that i could keep him from dying ever
now what do the experts call this
they say its denial
its a strong word isnt it
yet i will tell you that denial isnt even close to a strong enough word to describe what those of us facing the death of our loved ones go through
and i hear the medical professionals say well wed like to do such and such but the familys in denial
the family wont listen to reason
theyre in denial
how can they insist on this treatment at the end
its so clear yet theyre in denial
now i think this maybe isnt a very useful way of thinking
its not just families either
the medical professionals too you out there youre in denial too
you want to help you want to fix
you want to do
youve succeeded in everything youve done and having a patient die well that must feel like failure
i saw it firsthand
just days before terence died his oncologist said tell terence that better days are just ahead
days before he died
yet ira byock the director of palliative medicine at dartmouth said you know the best doctor in the world has never succeeded in making anyone immortal
so what the experts call denial i call hope and id like to borrow a phrase from my friends in software design
you just redefine denial and hope and it becomes a feature of being human
its not a bug
its a feature
so we need to think more constructively about this very common very profound and very powerful human emotion
its part of the human condition and yet our system and our thinking isnt built to accommodate it
so terence told me a story on that long ago night and i believed it
maybe i wanted to believe it
and during terences illness i we we wanted to believe the story of our fight together too
giving up the fight for thats how it felt it felt like giving up meant giving up not only his life but also our story our story of us as fighters the story of us as invincible and for the doctors the story of themselves as healers
so what do we need
maybe we dont need a new piece of paper
maybe we need a new story not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness but rather a story of victory and triumph of a valiant battle and eventually a graceful retreat a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal and that no wife no matter how hard she tried has ever stopped even the bravest wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go
people did mention hospice but i wouldnt listen
hospice was for people who were dying and terence wasnt dying
as a result he spent just four days in hospice which im sure as you all know is a pretty typical outcome and we never said goodbye because we were unprepared for the end
we have a noble path to curing the disease patients and doctors alike but there doesnt seem to be a noble path to dying
dying is seen as failing and we had a heroic narrative for fighting together but we didnt have a heroic narrative for letting go
so maybe we need a narrative for acknowledging the end and for saying goodbye and maybe our new story will be about a heros fight and a heros goodbye
terence loved poetry and the greek poet constantine cavafy is one of my favorite poets
so ill give you a couple lines from him
this is a poem about mark antony
you know mark antony the conquering hero cleopatras guy
actually one of cleopatras guys
and hes been a pretty good general
hes won all the fights hes eluded all the people that are out to get him and yet this time finally hes come to the city of alexandria and realized hes lost
the people are leaving theyre playing instruments
theyre singing
and suddenly he knows hes been defeated
and he suddenly knows hes been deserted by the gods and its time to let go
and the poet tells him what to do
he tells him how to say a noble goodbye a goodbye thats fit for a hero
as if long prepared as if courageous as it becomes you who were worthy of such a city approach the window with a firm step and with emotion but not with the entreaties or the complaints of a coward as a last enjoyment listen to the sounds the exquisite instruments of the musical troops and bid her farewell the alexandria you are losing
thats a goodbye for a man who was larger than life a goodbye for a man for whom anything well almost anything was possible a goodbye for a man who kept hope alive
and isnt that what were missing
how can we learn that peoples decisions about their loved ones are often based strongly powerfully many times irrationally on the slimmest of hopes
the overwhelming presence of hope isnt denial
its part of our dna as humans and maybe its time our healthcare system doctors patients insurance companies us started accounting for the power of that hope
hope isnt a bug
its a feature
thank you

title eleni gabre madhin a commodities exchange for ethiopia title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript economist eleni gabre madhin outlines her ambitious vision to found the first commodities market in ethiopia her plan would create wealth minimize risk for farmers and turn the worlds largest recipient of food aid into a regional food basket description
you know theres a small country nestled in the himalayan mountains far from these beautiful mountains where the people of the kingdom of bhutan have decided to do something different which is to measure their gross national happiness rather than their gross national product
and why not
after all happiness is not just a privilege for the lucky few but a fundamental human right for all
and what is happiness
happiness is the freedom of choice
the freedom to chose where to live what to do what to buy what to sell from whom to whom when and how
where does choice come from
and who gets to express it and how do we express it
well one way to express choice is through the market
well functioning markets provide choices and ultimately the ability to express ones pursuit for happiness
the great indian economist amartya sen was awarded the nobel prize for demonstrating that famine is not so much about the availability of food supply but rather the ability to acquire or entitle oneself to that food through the market
in in what can only be considered one of the greatest crimes of humanity nearly one million people died of starvation in my country of birth ethiopia
not because there was not enough food because there was actually a surplus of food in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country but because in the north people could not access or entitle themselves to that food
that was a turning point for my life
most africans today by far are farmers
and most of africas farmers are by and large small farmers in terms of land that they operate and very very small farmers in terms of the capital they have at their disposal
african agriculture today is among or is the most under capitalized in the world
only seven percent of arable land in africa is irrigated compared to percent in asia
african farmers only use some kilograms of fertilizer per hectare compared to in asia
road density is six times greater in asia than it is in rural africa
there are eight times more tractors in latin america and three times more tractors in asia than in africa
the small farmer in africa today lives a life without much choice and therefore without much freedom
his livelihood is predetermined by the conditions of grinding poverty
he comes to the market when prices are lowest with the meager fruits of his hard labor just after the harvest because he has no choice
she comes back to the market some months later when prices are highest in what we call the lean season when food is scarce because she has to feed her family and has no choice
the real question is how can markets be developed in rural africa to harness the power of innovation and entrepreneurship that we know exists
another notable economist theodore schultz in won the nobel prize for demonstrating that farmers are efficient but poor
meaning in fact that farmers are rational and profit minded just like everybody else
well we dont need now any more nobel prizes to know that farmers want a fair shake at the market and want to make money just like everyone else
and one thing is clear which is at least now we know that africa is open for business
and that business is agriculture
over two decades ago the world insisted to africa that markets must be liberalized that economies must be structurally adjusted
this meant that governments were to remove themselves from the business of buying and selling which they did rather inefficiently and let the private market do its magic
well what happened over the last years
did africa feed itself
did our farmers turn into highly productive commercial actors
i think were all in this room probably because we know that in fact africa is the only region in the world where hunger and malnutrition are projected to go up over the next years where the food import bill is now double what it was years ago where food production per capita has stagnated and where fertilizer use has declined rather than increased
so why didnt agriculture markets perform to expectations
the market reforms prompted by the west and ive spent some years traveling around the continent doing research on agricultural markets and have interviewed traders in to countries in this continent hundreds of traders trying to understand what went wrong with our market reform
and it seems to me that the reforms might have thrown the baby out with the bath water
like its agriculture africas markets are highly under capitalized and inefficient
we know from our work around the continent that transaction costs of reaching the market and the risks of transacting in rural agriculture markets are extremely high
in fact only one third of agricultural output produced in africa even reaches the market
africas markets are weak not only because of weak infrastructure in terms of roads and telecommunications but also because of the virtual absence of necessary market institutions such as market information grades and standards and reliable ways to connect buyers and sellers
because of this commodity buyers and sellers typically transact in small circles in narrow networks of people they know and trust
and because of that as grain changes hands and ive measured that it changes hands four five times in its trajectory from the farmer to the consumer every time it changes hands and ive seen this all over rural africa it also changes sacks
and i thought that was incredibly peculiar
and really realized that that was because as traders would tell me over and over thats the only way people know what theyre getting in terms of the quantity and the product quality
and that actually has huge implications for the ability of markets to quickly respond to price signals and situations where there are deficits for example
it also has very high cost implications
i have measured that percent of the marketing margin is simply due to the fact that because of the absence of grades and standards and market information sacks have to be constantly changed
and this leads to very high handling costs
for their part small farmers who produce the bulk of our agricultural output in africa come to the market with virtually no information at all blind trusting that theyre going to have some sort of demand for their produce and completely at the mercy of the merchants in the only market the nearest local market they know where theyre unable to negotiate better prices or reduce their risk
speaking of risk we have seen that price volatility of food crops in africa is the highest in the world
in africa small farmers bear the brunt of this risk
in fact in my view there is no region of the world and no period in history that farmers have been expected to bear the kind of market risk that africas farmers have to bear
and in my view there is simply no place in the world that has grown its agriculture on the kind of risk that our farmers in africa today face
in ethiopia for example the variation in maize prices from year to year is as much as percent annually
this kind of market risk is mind boggling and has direct implications for not only the incentives of farmers to invest in higher productivity technology such as modern seeds and fertilizers but also direct implications for food security
to give you an example between and ethiopian maize farmers produced two years of bumper harvest
that in turn because of the weak marketing system led to an percent collapse in maize prices in the country
this made it unprofitable for some farmers to even harvest the grain from the fields
and we calculated that some tons of grain was left in the fields to rot in early
not six months later in july ethiopia announced a major food crisis to the same proportions as million people at risk of starvation
what also happened that year is in the areas where there were good rains and where farmers had previously produced surplus grain farmers had decided to withdraw from the fertilizer market not use fertilizer and actually had dropped their use of fertilizer by percent
this is a tragic example of arrested development or a budding green revolution stopped in its tracks
and this is not just specific to ethiopia but happens over and over all over africa
well im not here today to lament about the situation or wring my hands
i am here to tell you that change is in the air
africa today is not the africa waiting for aid solutions or cookie cutter foreign expert policy prescriptions
africa has learned or is learning somewhat slowly that markets dont happen by themselves
in the it was very fashionable to talk about getting prices right
there was a very influential book about that which was mainly about getting governments out of the market
we now recognize that getting markets right is about not just price incentives but also investing in the right infrastructure and the appropriate and necessary institutions to create the conditions to unleash the power of innovation in the market
when conditions are right we know and see that that innovation is ready to explode in rural africa just like anywhere else
nearly three years ago i decided to leave my comfortable job as a world bank senior economist in washington and come back to my country of birth ethiopia after nearly years abroad
i did so for a simple reason
after having spent more than a decade understanding studying and trying to convince policymakers and donors about what was wrong with africas agricultural markets i decided it was time to do something about it
i currently lead in ethiopia an exciting new initiative to establish the first ethiopia commodity exchange or ecx
now the commodity exchange itself that concept is not new to the world
in fact in grain merchants and farmers got together in a small town at the crossroads of the illinois river and lake michigan to establish a way to trade better amongst themselves
that was of course the birth of the chicago board of trade which is the most famous commodity exchange in the world
the chicago board of trade was established then for precisely the same reasons that our farmers today would benefit from a commodity exchange
in the american midwest farmers used to load grain onto barges and send it upriver to the chicago market
but once it arrived if no buyer was to be found or if prices suddenly dropped farmers would incur tremendous losses
and in fact would even dump the grain in lake michigan rather than spend more money transporting it back to their farms
well the need to avoid these huge risks and tremendous losses led to the birth of the futures market and the underlying system of grading grain and receipting issuing warehouse receipts on the basis of which trade could be done
from there the greatest innovation of all came about in this market which is that buyers and sellers could transact grain without actually having to physically or visually inspect the grain
that meant that grain could be traded across tremendous distances and even across time as far forward as months into the future
this innovation is at the heart of the transformation of american agriculture and the rise of chicago to a global market agricultural market superpower from where it was a small regional town
now over the last century we tend to think of commodity exchanges as the purview of western industrialized countries and that the reference prices for cotton coffee cocoa products produced mainly in the south are actually a reference price or a price discovered in these organized commodity exchanges in the northern countries
but that is actually changing
and were seeing a shift powered mainly because of information technology a shift in market dominance towards the emerging markets
and over the last decade you see that the share of western exchanges and this is the u s share of exchanges in the world has gone down by nearly half in just the last decade
similarly theres been explosive growth in india for example where rural farmers are using exchanges growing here over the last three years by percent a year
this is powered by low cost vsat technology aggressively trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market
chinas dalian commodity exchange three years ago overtook the chicago board of trade to become the second largest commodity exchange in the world
now in ethiopia were in the process of designing the first organized ethiopia commodity exchange
were not trying to cut and paste the chicago model or the india model but creating a system uniquely tailored to ethiopias needs and realities ethiopias small farmers
so the ecx is an ethiopian exchange for ethiopia
were creating a system that serves all market actors that creates integrity trust efficiency transparency and enables small farmers to manage the risks that i have described
in the design of our commodity exchange in ethiopia weve done something rather unique which is to take the approach of an integrated perspective or what we call the ecx edge
the ecx edge pretty much creates the entire ecosystem in which the market will develop itself
and this is because one of the things weve learned over the last decade of studying market development in africa is that the piecemeal approach does not work
youve got one donor trying to develop market information another trying to work on or sponsor grades and standards another ict and yet another on warehousing or warehouse receipts
in our approach in ethiopia weve decided to put together the entire ecosystem or environment in which trade takes place
that means that the exchange will operate a trading system which will initially start as an open outcry because we dont think the countrys ready for full electronic trading
but at the same time well do something which i think no exchange in the world has ever done which is itself to operate something like an internet cafe in the rural areas
so that farmers and small traders can actually come to a terminal center what we call the remote access terminal centers and actually without having to buy a computer or figure out how to dial up or any of those things simply see the trading thats happening on the addis ababa trading floor
at the same time whats very fundamental to this market is that and again an innovation that weve designed for our exchange is that the exchange will operate warehouses around the country in which grade certification and warehouse receipting will be done
and in turn well operate an in house clearing system to assure that payment is done appropriately in the right amount and at the right time so that basically we create trust and integrity in the system
obviously we work with exchange actors and as were developing the exchange market itself were also developing the regulatory infrastructure and legal framework the overarching legal framework for making this market work
so in fact our proclamation is going to parliament next month
whats really important is that the ecx will operate a market information system to disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country using vsat technology to bring an electronic price dissemination directly to farmers
what this does is transforms fundamentally the farmers relationship to the market
whereas before the farmer used to think local meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market eight to kilometers away on average and sell whatever they happened to have without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was now farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market
and they start to think national and even global
they start to make not only commercial marketing decisions but also planting decisions on the basis of information coming from the futures price market
and they come to the market knowing what grades their products will achieve in terms of a price premium
so all of this will transform farmers
it will also transform the way traders do business
it will stop them from doing simple back to back limited arbitrage to really thinking strategically about how to move grain across long distances from to
can ethiopia do this
it seems very ambitious
but it will create new opportunities
we believe that this initiative requires great political will and well have to align the financial sector as well as the ict sector and really even the underlying legal framework
we believe that the winds of change are here and that we can do it
ecx is the market for ethiopias new millennium which starts in about eight months
the last parliament of our century opened with our president announcing to the country that this was the most important economic initiative for the country today
we believe that the stakes are high but that the returns will be even greater
ecx moreover can become a trading platform for a pan african market in agricultural commodities
ethiopias domestic market is about one billion dollars of value
and we feel that over the next five years if ethiopia can capture even percent just percent of the domestic market and add just percent value to that market the value of the market doubles
ethiopias agricultural market is percent higher than south africas grain production and in fact ethiopia is the second largest maize producer in africa
so the potential is there
the will is there
the commitment is there
so we feel that we have a winning value proposition to transform farmers choices to grow our agriculture and to change africa
so we are in the business of finding our happiness
thank you very much

title carl honoré in praise of slowness title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript journalist carl honore believes the western worlds emphasis on speed erodes health productivity and quality of life but theres a backlash brewing as everyday people start putting the brakes on their all too modern lives description
what id like to start off with is an observation which is that if ive learned anything over the last year its that the supreme irony of publishing a book about slowness is that you have to go around promoting it really fast
i seem to spend most of my time these days zipping from city to city studio to studio interview to interview serving up the book in really tiny bite size chunks
because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down but they want to know how to slow down really quickly so
so i did a spot on cnn the other day where i actually spent more time in makeup than i did talking on air
and i think that thats not really surprising though is it
because thats kind of the world that we live in now a world stuck in fast forward
a world obsessed with speed with doing everything faster with cramming more and more into less and less time
every moment of the day feels like a race against the clock
to borrow a phrase from carrie fisher which is in my bio there ill just toss it out again these days even instant gratification takes too long
and if you think about how we to try to make things better what do we do
no we speed them up dont we so we used to dial now we speed dial
we used to read now we speed read we used to walk now we speed walk
and of course we used to date and now we speed date
and even things that are by their very nature slow we try and speed them up too
so i was in new york recently and i walked past a gym that had an advertisement in the window for a new course a new evening course
and it was for you guessed it speed yoga
so this the perfect solution for time starved professionals who want to you know salute the sun but only want to give over about minutes to it
i mean these are sort of the extreme examples and theyre amusing and good to laugh at
but theres a very serious point and i think that in the headlong dash of daily life we often lose sight of the damage that this roadrunner form of living does to us
were so marinated in the culture of speed that we almost fail to notice the toll it takes on every aspect of our lives on our health our diet our work our relationships the environment and our community
and sometimes it takes a wake up call doesnt it to alert us to the fact that were hurrying through our lives instead of actually living them that were living the fast life instead of the good life
and i think for many people that wake up call takes the form of an illness
you know a burnout or eventually the body says i cant take it anymore and throws in the towel
or maybe a relationship goes up in smoke because we havent had the time or the patience or the tranquility to be with the other person to listen to them
and my wake up call came when i started reading bedtime stories to my son and i found that at the end of day i would go into his room and i just couldnt slow down you know id be speed reading the cat in the hat
id be you know id be skipping lines here paragraphs there sometimes a whole page and of course my little boy knew the book inside out so we would quarrel
and what should have been the most relaxing the most intimate the most tender moment of the day when a dad sits down to read to his son became instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills a clash between my speed and his slowness
and this went on for some time until i caught myself scanning a newspaper article with timesaving tips for fast people
and one of them made reference to a series of books called the one minute bedtime story
and i wince saying those words now but my first reaction at the time was very different
my first reflex was to say hallelujah what a great idea
this is exactly what im looking for to speed up bedtime even more
but thankfully a light bulb went on over my head and my next reaction was very different and i took a step back and i thought whoa you know has it really come to this
am i really in such a hurry that im prepared to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day
and i put away the newspaper and i was getting on a plane and i sat there and i did something i hadnt done for a long time which is i did nothing
i just thought and i thought long and hard
and by the time i got off that plane id decided i wanted to do something about it
i wanted to investigate this whole roadrunner culture and what it was doing to me and to everyone else
and i had two questions in my head
the first was how did we get so fast
and the second is is it possible or even desirable to slow down
now if you think about how our world got so accelerated the usual suspects rear their heads
you think of you know urbanization consumerism the workplace technology
but i think if you cut through those forces you get to what might be the deeper driver the nub of the question which is how we think about time itself
in other cultures time is cyclical
its seen as moving in great unhurried circles
its always renewing and refreshing itself
whereas in the west time is linear
its a finite resource its always draining away
you either use it or lose it
time is money as benjamin franklin said
and i think what that does to us psychologically is it creates an equation
time is scarce so what do we do
well well we speed up dont we
we try and do more and more with less and less time
we turn every moment of every day into a race to the finish line a finish line incidentally that we never reach but a finish line nonetheless
and i guess that the question is is it possible to break free from that mindset
and thankfully the answer is yes because what i discovered when i began looking around that there is a global backlash against this culture that tells us that faster is always better and that busier is best
right across the world people are doing the unthinkable theyre slowing down and finding that although conventional wisdom tells you that if you slow down youre road kill the opposite turns out to be true that by slowing down at the right moments people find that they do everything better
they eat better they make love better they exercise better they work better they live better
and in this kind of cauldron of moments and places and acts of deceleration lie what a lot of people now refer to as the international slow movement
now if youll permit me a small act of hypocrisy ill just give you a very quick overview of whats going on inside the slow movement if you think of food many of you will have heard of the slow food movement
started in italy but has spread across the world and now has members in countries
and its driven by a very simple and sensible message which is that we get more pleasure and more health from our food when we cultivate cook and consume it at a reasonable pace
i think also the explosion of the organic farming movement and the renaissance of farmers markets are other illustrations of the fact that people are desperate to get away from eating and cooking and cultivating their food on an industrial timetable
they want to get back to slower rhythms
and out of the slow food movement has grown something called the slow cities movement which has started in italy but has spread right across europe and beyond
and in this towns begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape so that people are encouraged to slow down and smell the roses and connect with one another
so they might curb traffic or put in a park bench or some green space
and in some ways these changes add up to more than the sum of their parts because i think when a slow city becomes officially a slow city its kind of like a philosophical declaration
its saying to the rest of world and to the people in that town that we believe that in the century slowness has a role to play
in medicine i think a lot of people are deeply disillusioned with the kind of quick fix mentality you find in conventional medicine
and millions of them around the world are turning to complementary and alternative forms of medicine which tend to tap into sort of slower gentler more holistic forms of healing
now obviously the jury is out on many of these complementary therapies and i personally doubt that the coffee enema will ever you know gain mainstream approval
but other treatments such as acupuncture and massage and even just relaxation clearly have some kind of benefit
and blue chip medical colleges everywhere are starting to study these things to find out how they work and what we might learn from them
sex theres an awful lot of fast sex around isnt there
i was coming to well no pun intended there
i was making my way lets say slowly to oxford and i went through a news agent and i saw a magazine a mens magazine and it said on the front how to bring your partner to orgasm in seconds
so you know even sex is on a stopwatch these days
now you know i like a quickie as much as the next person but i think that theres an awful lot to be gained from slow sex from slowing down in the bedroom
you know you tap into that those deeper sort of psychological emotional spiritual currents and you get a better orgasm with the buildup
you can get more bang for your buck lets say
i mean the pointer sisters said it most eloquently didnt they when they sang the praises of a lover with a slow hand
now we all laughed at sting a few years ago when he went tantric but you fast forward a few years and now you find couples of all ages flocking to workshops or maybe just on their own in their own bedrooms finding ways to put on the brakes and have better sex
and of course in italy where i mean italians always seem to know where to find their pleasure theyve launched an official slow sex movement
the workplace
right across much of the world north america being a notable exception working hours have been coming down
and europe is an example of that and people finding that their quality of life improves as theyre working less and also that their hourly productivity goes up
now clearly there are problems with the hour workweek in france too much too soon too rigid
but other countries in europe notably the nordic countries are showing that its possible to have a kick ass economy without being a workaholic
and norway sweden denmark and finland now rank among the top six most competitive nations on earth and they work the kind of hours that would make the average american weep with envy
and if you go beyond sort of the country level down at the micro company level more and more companies now are realizing that they need to allow their staff either to work fewer hours or just to unplug to take a lunch break or to go sit in a quiet room to switch off their blackberrys and laptops you at the back mobile phones during the work day or on the weekend so that they have time to recharge and for the brain to slide into that kind of creative mode of thought
its not just though these days adults who overwork though is it its children too
im and my childhood ended in the mid and i look at kids now and im just amazed by the way they race around with more homework more tutoring more extracurriculars than we would ever have conceived of a generation ago
and some of the most heartrending emails that i get on my website are actually from adolescents hovering on the edge of burnout pleading with me to write to their parents to help them slow down to help them get off this full throttle treadmill
but thankfully there is a backlash there in parenting as well and youre finding that you know towns in the united states are now banding together and banning extracurriculars on a particular day of the month so that people can you know decompress and have some family time and slow down
homework is another thing there are homework bans springing up all over the developed world in schools which had been piling on the homework for years and now theyre discovering that less can be more
so there was a case up in scotland recently where a fee paying high achieving private school banned homework for everyone under the age of and the high achieving parents freaked out and said what are you you know our kids will fall the headmaster said no no your children need to slow down at the end of the day
and just this last month the exam results came in and in math science marks went up percent on average last year
and i think whats very revealing is that the elite universities who are often cited as the reason that people drive their kids and hothouse them so much are starting to notice the caliber of students coming to them is falling these kids have wonderful marks they have cvs jammed with extracurriculars to the point that would make your eyes water
but they lack spark they lack the ability to think creatively and think outside they dont know how to dream and so what these ivy league schools and oxford and cambridge and so on are starting to send a message to parents and students that they need to put on the brakes a little bit
and in harvard for instance they send out a letter to undergraduates freshmen telling them that theyll get more out of life and more out of harvard if they put on the brakes if they do less but give time to things the time that things need to enjoy them to savor them
and even if they sometimes do nothing at all
and that letter is called very revealing i think slow down with an exclamation mark on the end
so wherever you look the message it seems to me is the same that less is very often more that slower is very often better but that said of course its not that easy to slow down is it
i mean you heard that i got a speeding ticket while i was researching my book on the benefits of slowness and thats true but thats not all of it
i was actually en route to a dinner held by slow food at the time
and if thats not shaming enough i got that ticket in italy
and if any of you have ever driven on an italian highway youll have a pretty good idea of how fast i was going
but why is it so hard to slow down
i think there are various reasons
one is that speed is fun you know speed is sexy
its all that adrenaline rush its hard to give it up
i think theres a kind of metaphysical dimension that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger deeper questions
we fill our head with distraction with busyness so that we dont have to ask am i well am i happy are my children growing up right
are politicians making good decisions on my behalf
another reason although i think perhaps the most powerful reason why we find it hard to slow down is the cultural taboo that weve erected against slowing down
slow is a dirty word in our culture
its a byword for lazy slacker for being somebody who gives up
you know hes a bit slow its actually synonymous with being stupid
i guess what the slow movement the purpose of the slow movement or its main goal really is to tackle that taboo and to say that yes sometimes slow is not the answer that there is such a thing as bad slow
you know i got stuck on the which is a ring road around london recently and spent three and a half hours there and i can tell you thats really bad slow
but the new idea the sort of revolutionary idea of the slow movement is that there is such a thing as good slow too
and good slow is you know taking the time to eat a meal with your family with the tv switched off
or taking the time to look at a problem from all angles in the office to make the best decision at work
or even simply just taking the time to slow down and savor your life
now one of the things that i found most uplifting about all of this stuff thats happened around the book since it came out is the reaction to it
and i knew that when my book on slowness came out it would be welcomed by the new age brigade but its also been taken up with great gusto by the corporate world you know business press but also big companies and leadership organizations
because people at the top of the chain people like you i think are starting to realize that theres too much speed in the system theres too much busyness and its time to find or get back to that lost art of shifting gears
another encouraging sign i think is that its not just in the developed world that this ideas been taken up in the developing world in countries that are on the verge of making that leap into first world status china brazil thailand poland and so on these countries have embraced the idea of the slow movement many people in them and theres a debate going on in their media on the streets
because i think theyre looking at the west and theyre saying well we like that aspect of what youve got but were not so sure about that
so all of that said is it i guess is it possible
thats really the main question before us today is it possible to slow down and im happy to be able to say to you that the answer is a resounding yes
and i present myself as exhibit a a kind of reformed and rehabilitated speed aholic
i still love speed you know i live in london and i work as a journalist and i enjoy the buzz and the busyness and the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things
i play squash and ice hockey two very fast sports and i wouldnt give them up for the world
but ive also over the last year or so got in touch with my inner tortoise
and what that means is that i no longer overload myself gratuitously
my default mode is no longer to be a rush aholic
i no longer hear times winged chariot drawing near or at least not as much as i did before
i can actually hear it now because i see my time is ticking off
and the upshot of all of that is that i actually feel a lot happier healthier more productive than i ever have
i feel like im living my life rather than actually just racing through it
and perhaps the most important measure of the success of this is that i feel that my relationships are a lot deeper richer stronger
and for me i guess the litmus test for whether this would work and what it would mean was always going to be bedtime stories because thats sort of where the journey began and there too the news is rosy you know at the end of the day i go into my sons room
i dont wear a watch i switch off my computer so i cant hear the email pinging into the basket and i just slow down to his pace and we read
and because children have their own tempo and internal clock they dont do quality time where you schedule minutes for them to open up to you
they need you to move at their rhythm
i find that minutes into a story you know my son will suddenly say you know something happened in the playground today that really bothered me
and well go off and have a conversation on that
and i now find that bedtime stories used to be a box on my to do list something that i dreaded because it was so slow and i had to get through it quickly
its become my reward at the end of the day something i really cherish
and i have a kind of hollywood ending to my talk this afternoon which goes a little bit like this a few months ago i was getting ready to go on another book tour and i had my bags packed
i was downstairs by the front door and i was waiting for a taxi and my son came down the stairs and hed made a card for me and he was carrying it
hed gone and stapled two cards very like these together and put a sticker of his favorite character tintin on the front
and he said to me or he handed this to me and i read it and it said to daddy love benjamin
and i thought aw thats really sweet
is that a good luck on the book tour card
and he said no no no daddy this is a card for being the best story reader in the world
and i thought yeah you know this slowing down thing really does work
thank you very much

title amy lockwood selling condoms in the congo title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript hiv is a serious problem in the dr congo and aid agencies have flooded the country with free and cheap condoms but few people are using them why reformed marketer amy lockwood offers a surprising answer that upends a traditional model of philanthropy description
i am a reformed marketer and i now work in international development
in october i spent some time in the democratic republic of congo which is the largest country in africa
in fact its as large as western europe but it only has miles of paved roads
the drc is a dangerous place
in the past years five million people have died due to a war in the east
but war isnt the only reason that life is difficult in the drc
there are many health issues as well
in fact the hiv prevalence rate is percent among adults
this might not sound like a large number but in a country with million people it means there are that are infected
and due to the poor infrastructure only percent of those are receiving the life saving drugs that they need
which is why in part donor agencies provide condoms at low or no cost
and so while i was in the drc i spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms including damien
damien runs a hotel outside of kinshasa
its a hotel thats only open until midnight so its not a place that you stay
but it is a place where sex workers and their clients come
now damien knows all about condoms but he doesnt sell them
he said theres just not in demand
its not surprising because only three percent of people in the drc use condoms
joseph and christine who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them their customers dont buy the branded versions
they like the generics
and as a marketer i found that curious
and so i started to look at what the marketing looked like
and it turns out that there are three main messages used by the donor agencies for these condoms fear financing and fidelity
they name the condoms things like vive to live or trust
they package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of hiv put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently
now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom
what is it that you think about just before you get a condom
sex
and the private companies that sell condoms in these places they understand this
their marketing is slightly different
the name might not be much different but the imagery sure is
some brands are aspirational and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative
and this made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing understanding whos the audience
and for donor agencies unfortunately the audience tends to be people that arent even in the country theyre working
its people back home people that support their work people like these
but if what were really trying to do is stop the spread of hiv we need to think about the customer the people whose behavior needs to change the couples the young women the young men whose lives depend on it
and so the lesson is this it doesnt really matter what youre selling you just have to think about who is your customer and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior
it might just save their lives
thank you

title aubrey de grey a roadmap to end aging title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript cambridge researcher aubrey de grey argues that aging is merely a disease and a curable one at that humans age in seven basic ways he says all of which can be averted description
minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit so im going to dive straight in right at the point where i get this thing to work
here we go im going to talk about five different things
im going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable
im going to talk about why we have to get our shit together and actually talk about this a bit more than we do
im going to talk about feasibility as well of course
im going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about aging
and then im going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about you know how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong namely by actually doing something about it
im going to do that in two steps
the first one im going to talk about is how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension which im going to define as years applied to people who are already in middle age when you start to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging
namely essentially an elimination of the relationship between how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year or indeed to get sick in the first place
and of course the last thing im going to talk about is how to reach that intermediate step that point of maybe years life extension
so im going to start with why we should
now i want to ask a question
hands up anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria
that was easy ok
ok hands up anyone in the audience whos not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing
ok so we all think malaria is a bad thing
thats very good news because i thought that was what the answer would be
now the thing is i would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging
and here is that characteristic
the only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does
now i like in an audience in britain especially to talk about the comparison with foxhunting which is something that was banned after a long struggle by the government not very many months ago
i mean i know im with a sympathetic audience here but as we know a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic
and this is actually a rather good comparison it seems to me
you know a lot of people said well you know city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time
its a traditional part of the way of life and we should be allowed to carry on doing it
its ecologically sound it stops the population explosion of foxes
but ultimately the government prevailed in the end because the majority of the british public and certainly the majority of members of parliament came to the conclusion that it was really something that should not be tolerated in a civilized society
and i think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades
what part of this do people not understand
its not just about life of course its about healthy life you know getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun whether or not dying may be fun
so really this is how i would like to describe it
its a global trance
these are the sorts of unbelievable excuses that people give for aging
and i mean ok im not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless
there are some good points to be made here things that we ought to be thinking about forward planning so that nothing goes too well so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging
but these are completely crazy when you actually remember your sense of proportion
you know these are arguments these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about
but the question is are they so dangerous these risks of doing something about aging that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite namely leaving aging as it is
are these so bad that they outweigh condemning people a day to an unnecessarily early death
you know if you havent got an argument thats that strong then just dont waste my time is what i say
now there is one argument that some people do think really is that strong and here it is
people worry about overpopulation they say well if we fix aging no ones going to die to speak of or at least the death toll is going to be much lower only from crossing st giles carelessly
and therefore were not going to be able to have many kids and kids are really important to most people
and thats true
and you know a lot of people try to fudge this question and give answers like this
i dont agree with those answers i think they basically dont work
i think its true that we will face a dilemma in this respect
we will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate or a high death rate
a high death rate will of course arise from simply rejecting these therapies in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids
and i say that thats fine the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice
whats not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future
if we vacillate hesitate and do not actually develop these therapies then we are condemning a whole cohort of people who would have been young enough and healthy enough to benefit from those therapies but will not be because we havent developed them as quickly as we could well be denying those people an indefinite life span and i consider that that is immoral
thats my answer to the overpopulation question
right so the next thing is now why should we get a little bit more active on this
and the fundamental answer is that the pro aging trance is not as dumb as it looks
its actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging
aging is ghastly but its inevitable so you know weve got to find some way to put it out of our minds and its rational to do anything that we might want to do to do that
like for example making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all
but of course that only works when we have both of these components
and as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear and we might be in range of doing something about aging this becomes part of the problem
this pro aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things
and thats why we have to really talk about this a lot in order to get peoples attention and make people realize that they are in a trance in this regard
so thats all im going to say about that
im now going to talk about feasibility
and the fundamental reason i think why we feel that aging is inevitable is summed up in a definition of aging that im giving here
a very simple definition
aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place which is to say metabolism
this is not a completely tautological statement its a reasonable statement
aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars and it also happens to us despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self repair mechanisms because those self repair mechanisms are not perfect
so basically metabolism which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next has side effects
those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology
thats a fine definition so we can put it this way we can say that you know we have this chain of events
and there are really two games in town according to most people with regard to postponing aging
theyre what im calling here the gerontology approach and the geriatrics approach
the geriatrician will intervene late in the day when pathology is becoming evident and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time and stop the accumulation of side effects from causing the pathology quite so soon
of course its a very short term ist strategy its a losing battle because the things that are causing the pathology are becoming more abundant as time goes on
the gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface because you know prevention is better than cure
but unfortunately the thing is that we dont understand metabolism very well
in fact we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work even cells were not really too good on yet
weve discovered things like for example rna interference only a few years ago and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work
basically gerontology is a fine approach in the end but it is not an approach whose time has come when were talking about intervention
so then what do we do about that
i mean thats a fine logic that sounds pretty convincing pretty ironclad doesnt it
but it isnt
before i tell you why it isnt im going to go a little bit into what im calling step two
just suppose as i said that we do acquire the ability to confer extra years of healthy life on people who are already in middle age lets say
im going to call that robust human rejuvenation ok
what would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today or equivalently of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive would actually live
in order to answer that question you might think its simple but its not simple
we cant just say well if theyre young enough to benefit from these therapies then theyll live years longer
thats the wrong answer
and the reason its the wrong answer is because of progress
there are two sorts of technological progress really for this purpose
there are fundamental major breakthroughs and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs
now they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time frames
fundamental breakthroughs very hard to predict how long its going to take to make a fundamental breakthrough
it was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun and it took us until to actually work out how to do it
but after that things were pretty steady and pretty uniform
i think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight
we can think really that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one if you like
the incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore
this is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough
and you see it in all sorts of technologies
computers you can look at a more or less parallel time line happening of course a bit later
you can look at medical care i mean hygiene vaccines antibiotics you know the same sort of time frame
so i think that actually step two that i called a step a moment ago isnt a step at all
that in fact the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension even though those people are already middle aged when the therapies arrive will be at some sort of cusp
they will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments that will give them a further or maybe years
in other words they will be staying ahead of the game
the therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us
this is a very important point for me to get across
because you know most people when they hear that i predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to or more they think that im saying that were going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to or more
im not saying that at all
im saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enough
theyll never be perfect but well be able to fix the things that year olds die of before we have any year olds
and the same for and and so on
i decided to give this a little name which is longevity escape velocity
well it seems to get the point across
so these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live in terms of remaining life expectancy as measured by their health for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive
if youre already or even if youre and an average year old we probably cant do a lot for you with these therapies because youre too close to deaths door for the really initial experimental therapies to be good enough for you
you wont be able to withstand them
but if youre only then theres a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive and you know eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense in terms of your youthfulness both physical and mental and in terms of your risk of death from age related causes
and of course if youre a bit younger than that then youre never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age related causes
so this is a genuine conclusion that i come to that the first year old we dont know how old that person is today because we dont know how long its going to take to get these first generation therapies
but irrespective of that age im claiming that the first person to live to subject of course to you know global catastrophes is actually probably only about years younger than the first year old
and thats quite a thought
alright so finally im going to spend the rest of the talk my last seven and a half minutes on step one namely how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension that will allow us to get to escape velocity
and in order to do that i need to talk about mice a little bit
i have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation
im calling it robust mouse rejuvenation not very imaginatively
and this is what it is
i say were going to take a long lived strain of mouse which basically means mice that live about three years on average
we do exactly nothing to them until theyre already two years old
and then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them and with those therapies we get them to live on average to their fifth birthday
so in other words we add two years we treble their remaining lifespan starting from the point that we started the therapies
the question then is what would that actually mean for the time frame until we get to the milestone i talked about earlier for humans
which we can now as ive explained equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity
secondly what does it mean for the publics perception of how long its going to take for us to get to those things starting from the time we get the mice
and thirdly the question is what will it do to actually how much people want it
and it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question and its extremely hard to answer
one has to be very speculative and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more
i say thats nonsense
i say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this
we need to give our best guess as to the time frame in order to give people a sense of proportion so that they can assess their priorities
so i say that we have a chance of reaching this rhr milestone robust human rejuvenation within years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation
years from the robust mouse
the publics perception will probably be somewhat better than that
the public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are
so theyll probably think its five years away
theyll be wrong but that actually wont matter too much
and finally of course i think its fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now is the global trance i spoke about earlier the coping strategy
that will be history at this point because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans since its been postponed so very effectively in mice
so were likely to end up with a very strong change in peoples attitudes and of course that has enormous implications
so in order to tell you now how were going to get these mice im going to add a little bit to my description of aging
im going to use this word damage to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism and that eventually cause pathology
because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology the damage itself is caused ongoing ly throughout life starting before were born
but it is not part of metabolism itself
and this turns out to be useful
because we can re draw our original diagram this way
we can say that fundamentally the difference between gerontology and geriatrics is that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate at which metabolism lays down this damage
and im going to explain exactly what damage is in concrete biological terms in a moment
and geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology
and the reason its a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate
so theres a third approach if we look at it this way
we can call it the engineering approach and i claim that the engineering approach is within range
the engineering approach does not intervene in any processes
it does not intervene in this process or this one
and thats good because it means that its not a losing battle and its something that we are within range of being able to do because it doesnt involve improving on evolution
the engineering approach simply says lets go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage not necessarily repair them completely but repair them quite a lot so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold that must exist that causes it to be pathogenic
we know that this threshold exists because we dont get age related diseases until were in middle age even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born
why do i say that were in range well this is basically it
the point about this slide is actually the bottom
if we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging we will be here all night because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another
this list is just for illustration it is incomplete
the list on the right is also incomplete
its a list of types of pathology that are age related and its just an incomplete list
but i would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete this is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end or that might cause pathology
and there are only seven of them
theyre categories of things of course but theres only seven of them
cell loss mutations in chromosomes mutations in the mitochondria and so on
first of all id like to give you an argument for why that list is complete
of course one can make a biological argument
one can say ok what are we made of
were made of cells and stuff between cells
what can damage accumulate in
the answer is long lived molecules because if a short lived molecule undergoes damage but then the molecule is destroyed like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis then the damage is gone too
its got to be long lived molecules
so these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty good news because it means that you know weve come a long way in biology in these years so the fact that we havent extended this list is a pretty good indication that theres no extension to be done
however its better than that we actually know how to fix them all in mice in principle and what i mean by in principle is we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade
some of them are partially implemented already the ones at the top
i havent got time to go through them at all but my conclusion is that if we can actually get suitable funding for this then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only years but we do need to get serious about it
we do need to really start trying
so of course there are some biologists in the audience and i want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have
but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff
ive published a great deal on this i cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based and theres quite a lot of detail there
the detail is what makes me confident of my rather aggressive time frames that im predicting here
so if you think that im wrong youd better damn well go and find out why you think im wrong
and of course the main thing is that you shouldnt trust people who call themselves gerontologists because as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field you know you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously
so you know youve got to actually do your homework in order to understand whether this is true
and well just end with a few things
one thing is you know youll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time and everyone said well its obviously impossible
and you know what happened
so you know this does happen
we have various strategies theres the methuselah mouse prize which is basically an incentive to innovate and to do what you think is going to work and you get money for it if you win
theres a proposal to actually put together an institute
this is whats going to take a bit of money
but i mean look how long does it take to spend that on the war in iraq
not very long ok
its got to be philanthropic because profits distract biotech but its basically got a percent chance i think of succeeding in this
and i think we know how to do it and ill stop there
thank you
chris anderson ok i dont know if theres going to be any questions but i thought i would give people the chance
audience since youve been talking about aging and trying to defeat it why is it that you make yourself appear like an old man
ag because i am an old man i am actually
audience species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate
however as far as i know all the species have evolved to actually die so when cells divide the telomerase get shorter and eventually species die
so why does evolution has seems to have selected against immortality when it is so advantageous or is evolution just incomplete
ag brilliant thank you for asking a question that i can answer with an uncontroversial answer
im going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question which i happen to agree with which is that no aging is not a product of selection evolution is simply a product of evolutionary neglect
in other words we have aging because its hard work not to have aging you need more genetic pathways more sophistication in your genes in order to age more slowly and that carries on being true the longer you push it out
so to the extent that evolution doesnt matter doesnt care whether genes are passed on by individuals living a long time or by procreation theres a certain amount of modulation of that which is why different species have different lifespans but thats why there are no immortal species
ca the genes dont care but we do
ag thats right
audience hello i read somewhere that in the last years the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by years
if i project that that would make me think that i would live until if i dont crash on my motorbike
that means that im one of your subjects to become a year old
ag if you lose a bit of weight
your numbers are a bit out
the standard numbers are that lifespans have been growing at between one and two years per decade
so its not quite as good as you might think you might hope
but i intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible
audience i was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults are actually in the human embryo and that the brain cells last years or so
if that is indeed true biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation
if there are cells in my body that live all years as opposed to a typical you know couple of months
ag there are technical implications certainly
basically what we need to do is replace cells in those few areas of the brain that lose cells at a respectable rate especially neurons but we dont want to replace them any faster than that or not much faster anyway because replacing them too fast would degrade cognitive function
what i said about there being no non aging species earlier on was a little bit of an oversimplification
there are species that have no aging hydra for example but they do it by not having a nervous system and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function on very long lived cells

title lewis pugh my mind shifting everest swim title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript after he swam the north pole lewis pugh vowed never to take another cold water dip then he heard of lake imja in the himalayas created by recent glacial melting and lake pumori a body of water at an altitude of m on everest and so began a journey that would teach him a radical new way to approach swimming and think about climate change description
last year when i was here i was speaking to you about a swim which i did across the north pole
and while that swim took place three years ago i can remember it as if it was yesterday
i remember standing on the edge of the ice about to dive into the water and thinking to myself i have never ever seen any place on this earth which is just so frightening
the water is completely black
the water is minus degrees centigrade or degrees fahrenheit
its flipping freezing in that water
and then a thought came across my mind if things go pear shaped on this swim how long will it take for my frozen body to sink the four and a half kilometers to the bottom of the ocean
and then i said to myself ive just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible
and the only way i can dive into that freezing cold water and swim a kilometer is by listening to my ipod and really revving myself up listening to everything from beautiful opera all the way across to puff daddy and then committing myself a hundred percent there is nothing more powerful than the made up mind and then walking up to the edge of the ice and just diving into the water
and that swim took me minutes and seconds and it felt like days
and i remember getting out of the water and my hands feeling so painful and looking down at my fingers and my fingers were literally the size of sausages because you know were made partially of water when water freezes it expands and so the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded and burst
and the most immediate thought when i came out of that water was the following im never ever going to do another cold water swim in my life again
anyway last year i heard about the himalayas and the melting of the and the melting of the glaciers because of climate change
i heard about this lake lake imja
this lake has been formed in the last couple of years because of the melting of the glacier
the glaciers gone all the way up the mountain and left in its place this big lake
and i firmly believe that what were seeing in the himalayas is the next great big battleground on this earth
nearly two billion people so one in three people on this earth rely on the water from the himalayas
and with a population increasing as quickly as it is and with the water supply from these glaciers because of climate change decreasing so much i think we have a real risk of instability
north youve got china south youve india pakistan bangladesh all these countries
and so i decided to walk up to mt everest the highest mountain on this earth and go and do a symbolic swim underneath the summit of mt everest
now i dont know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to mt everest but its quite an ordeal getting up there
great big powerful yaks carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain i dont just have my speedo but theres a big film crew who then send all the images around the world
the other thing which was so challenging about this swim is not just the altitude
i wanted to do the swim at meters above sea level
so its right up in the heavens
its very very difficult to breath you get altitude sickness
i feels like youve got a man standing behind you with a hammer just hitting your head all the time
thats not the worst part of it
the worst part was this year was the year where they decided to do a big cleanup operation on mt everest
many many people have died on mt everest and this was the year they decided to go and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers and then bring them down the mountain
and when youre walking up the mountain to attempt to do something which no human has ever done before and in fact no fish there are no fish up there swimming at meters when youre trying to do that and then the bodies are coming past you it humbles you and you also realize very very clearly that nature is so much more powerful than we are
and we walked up this pathway all the way up
and to the right hand side of us was this great khumbu glacier
and all the way along the glacier we saw these big pools of melting ice
and then we got up to this small lake underneath the summit of mt everest and i prepared myself the same way as ive always prepared myself for this swim which was going to be so very difficult
i put on my ipod i listened to some music i got myself as aggressive as possible but controlled aggression and then i hurled myself into that water
i swam as quickly as i could for the first hundred meters and then i realized very very quickly i had a huge problem on my hands
i could barely breathe
i was gasping for air
i then began to choke and then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water
and it all happened so quickly i then i dont know how it happened but i went underwater
and luckily the water was quite shallow and i was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake and get up and then take another gasp of air
and then i said carry on carry on carry on
i carried on for another five or six strokes and then i had nothing in my body and i went down to the bottom of the lake
and i dont where i got it from but i was able to somehow pull myself up and as quickly as possible get to the side of the lake
ive heard it said that drowning is the most peaceful death that you can have
i have never ever heard such utter bollocks
it is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have
i got myself to the side of the lake
my crew grabbed me and then we walked as quickly as we could down over the rubble down to our camp
and there we sat down and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on mt everest
and my team just gave it to me straight
they said lewis you need to have a radical tactical shift if you want to do this swim
every single thing which you have learned in the past years of swimming you must forget
every single thing which you learned when you were serving in the british army about speed and aggression you put that to one side
we want you to walk up the hill in another two days time
take some time to rest and think about things
we want you to walk up the mountain in two days time and instead of swimming fast swim as slowly as possible
instead of swimming crawl swim breaststroke
and remember never ever swim with aggression
this is the time to swim with real humility
and so we walked back up to the mountain two days later
and i stood there on the edge of the lake and i looked up at mt everest and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth and i said to myself just do this slowly
and i swam across the lake
and i cant begin to tell you how good i felt when i came to the other side
but i learned two very very important lessons there on mt everest and i thank my team of sherpas who taught me this
the first one is that just because something has worked in the past so well doesnt mean its going to work in the future
and similarly now before i do anything i ask myself what type of mindset do i require to successfully complete a task
and taking that into the world of climate change which is frankly the mt everest of all problems just because weve lived the way we have lived for so long just because we have consumed the way we have for so long and populated the earth the way we have for so long doesnt mean that we can carry on the way we are carrying on
the warning signs are all there
when i was born the worlds population was billion people
were now billion people and were expected to be billion people by
and then the second lesson the radical tactical shift
and ive come here to ask you today what radical tactical shift can you take in your relationship to the environment which will ensure that our children and our grandchildren live in a safe world and a secure world and most importantly in a sustainable world
and i ask you please to go away from here and think about that one radical tactical shift which you could make which will make that big difference and then commit a hundred percent to doing it
blog about it tweet about it talk about it and commit a hundred percent because very very few things are impossible to achieve if we really put our whole minds to it
so thank you very very much

title john hodgman design explained title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript john hodgman comedian and resident expert explains the design of three iconic modern objects description
today im going to unpack for you three examples of iconic design and it makes perfect sense that i should be the one to do it because i have a bachelors degree in literature
but im also a famous minor television personality and an avid collector of design within reach catalogs so i pretty much know everything there is
now im sure you recognize this object many of you probably saw it as you were landing your private zeppelins at los angeles international airport over the past couple of days
this is known as the theme building that is its name for reasons that are still very murky
and it is perhaps the best example we have in los angeles of ancient extraterrestrial architecture
it was first excavated in as they were building lax although scientists believe that it dates back to the year before common era when it was used as a busy transdimensional space port by the ancient astronauts who first colonized this planet and raised our species from savagery by giving us the gift of written language and technology and the gift of revolving restaurants
it is thought to have been a replacement for the older space ports located of course at stonehenge and considered to be quite an improvement due to the uncluttered design the lack of druids hanging around all the time and obviously the much better access to parking
when it was uncovered it ushered in a new era of streamlined archaically futuristic design called googie which came to be synonymous with the jet age a misnomer
after all the ancient astronauts who used it did not travel by jet very often preferring instead to travel by feathered serpent powered by crystal skulls
ah yes a table
we use these every day
and on top of it the juicy salif
this is a design by philippe starck who i believe is in the audience at this very moment
and you can tell it is a starck design by its precision its playfulness its innovation and its promise of imminent violence
it is a design that challenges your intuition it is not what you think it is when you first see it
it is not a fork designed to grab three hors doeuvres at a time which would be useful out in the lobby i would say
and despite its obvious influence by the ancient astronauts and its space agey ness and tripodism it is not something designed to attach to your brain and suck out your thoughts
it is in fact a citrus juicer and when i say that you never see it as anything else again
it is also not a monument to design it is a monument to designs utility
you can take it home with you unlike the theme building which will stay where it is forever
this is affordable and can come home with you and as such it can sit on your kitchen counter it cant go in your drawers trust me i found that out the hard way and make your kitchen counter into a monument to design
one other thing about it if you do have one at home let me tell you one of the features you may not know when you fall asleep it comes alive and it walks around your house and goes through your mail and watches you as you sleep
okay what is this object
i have no idea i dont know what that thing is
it looks terrible is it a little hot plate
i dont get it
does anyone know chi
its an iphone iphone
oh yes thats right i remember those i had my whole bathroom tiles redone with those back in the good old days
no i have an iphone of course i do
here is my well loved iphone
i do so many things on this little device
i like to read books on it
more than that i like to buy books on it that i never have to feel guilty about not reading because they go in here and i never look at them again and its perfect
i use it every day to measure the weight of an ox for example
every now and then i admit that i complete a phone call on it occasionally
and yet i forget about it all the time
this is a design that once you saw it you forgot about it
it is easy to forget the gasp inducement that occurred in when you first touched this thing because it became so quickly pervasive and because of how instantly we adopted these gestures and made it an extension of our life
unlike the theme building this is not alien technology
or i should say what it did was it took technology which unlike people in this room to many other people in the world still feels very alien and made it immediately and instantly feel familiar and intimate
and unlike the juicy salif it does not threaten to attach itself to your brain rather it simply attaches itself to your brain
and you didnt even notice it happened
so there you go my name is john hodgman
i just explained design
thank you very much

title lakshmi pratury the lost art of letter writing title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript lakshmi pratury remembers the lost art of letter writing and shares a series of notes her father wrote to her before he died her short but heartfelt talk may inspire you to set pen to paper too description
so i thought i will talk about death
seemed to be the passion today
actually its not about death
its inevitable terrible but really what i want to talk about is im just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die
thats what i want to talk about
so art buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video that appeared soon after he died saying hi im art buchwald and i just died
and mike who i met at galapagos a trip which i won at ted is leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling his journey through cancer
and my father left me a legacy of his handwriting through letters and a notebook
in the last two years of his life when he was sick he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me
he wrote about my strengths weaknesses and gentle suggestions for improvement quoting specific incidents and held a mirror to my life
after he died i realized that no one writes to me anymore
handwriting is a disappearing art
im all for email and thinking while typing but why give up old habits for new
why cant we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives
there are times when i want to trade all those years that i was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him and trade all those years for one hug
but too late
but thats when i take out his letters and i read them and the paper that touched his hand is in mine and i feel connected to him
so maybe we all need to leave our children with a value legacy and not a financial one
a value for things with a personal touch an autograph book a soul searching letter
if a fraction of this powerful ted audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper john itll be a recycled one and write a beautiful letter to someone they love we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes
so what do i plan to leave for my son
i collect autograph books and those of you authors in the audience know i hound you for them and cds too tracy
i plan to publish my own notebook
as i witnessed my fathers body being swallowed by fire i sat by his funeral pyre and wrote
i have no idea how im going to do it but i am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book and leave that published book for my son
id like to end with a few verses of what i wrote at my fathers cremation
and those linguists please pardon the grammar because ive not looked at it in the last years
i took it out for the first time to come here
picture in a frame ashes in a bottle boundless energy confined in the bottle forcing me to deal with reality forcing me to deal with being grown up
i hear you and i know that you would want me to be strong but right now i am being sucked down surrounded and suffocated by these raging emotional waters craving to cleanse my soul trying to emerge on a firm footing one more time to keep on fighting and flourishing just as you taught me
your encouraging whispers in my whirlpool of despair holding me and heaving me to shores of sanity to live again and to love again

title andrew blum discover the physical side of the internet title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript when a squirrel chewed through a cable and knocked him offline journalist andrew blum started wondering what the internet was really made of so he set out to go see it the underwater cables secret switches and other physical bits that make up the net description
ive always written primarily about architecture about buildings and writing about architecture is based on certain assumptions
an architect designs a building and it becomes a place or many architects design many buildings and it becomes a city and regardless of this complicated mix of forces of politics and culture and economics that shapes these places at the end of the day you can go and you can visit them you can walk around them
you can smell them you can get a feel for them
you can experience their sense of place
but what was striking to me over the last several years was that less and less was i going out into the world and more and more i was sitting in front of my computer screen
and especially since about when i got an iphone i was not only sitting in front of my screen all day but i was also getting up at the end of the day and looking at this little screen that i carried in my pocket
and what was surprising to me was how quickly my relationship to the physical world had changed
in this very short period of time you know whether you call it the last years or so of being online or the last you know four or five years of being online all the time our relationship to our surroundings had changed in that our attention is constantly divided you know were both looking inside the screens and were looking out in the world around us
and what was even more striking to me and what i really got hung up on was that the world inside the screen seemed to have no physical reality of its own
if you went and looked for images of the internet this was all that you found this famous image by opte of the internet as the kind of milky way this infinite expanse where we dont seem to be anywhere on it
we can never seem to grasp it in its totality
its always reminded me of the apollo image of the earth the blue marble picture and its similarly meant to suggest i think that we cant really understand it as a whole
were always sort of small in the face of its expanse
so if there was this world and this screen and if there was the physical world around me i couldnt ever get them together in the same place
and then this happened
my internet broke one day as it occasionally does and the cable guy came to fix it and he started with the dusty clump of cables behind the couch and he followed it to the front of my building and into the basement and out to the back yard and there was this big jumble of cables against the wall
and then he saw a squirrel running along the wire and he said theres your problem
a squirrel is chewing on your internet
and this seemed astounding the internet is a transcendent idea its a set of protocols that has changed everything from shopping to dating to revolutions
it was unequivocally not something a squirrel could chew on
but that in fact seemed to be the case
a squirrel had in fact chewed on my internet
and then i got this image in my head of what would happen if you yanked the wire from the wall and if you started to follow it where would it go
was the internet actually a place that you could visit
could i go there who would i meet
you know was there something actually out there
and the answer by all accounts was no
this was the internet this black box with a red light on it as represented in the sitcom the it crowd
normally it lives on the top of big ben because thats where you get the best reception but they had negotiated that their colleague could borrow it for the afternoon to use in an office presentation
the elders of the internet were willing to part with it for a short while and she looks at it and she says this is the internet the whole internet is it heavy
they say of course not the internet doesnt weigh anything
and i was embarrassed i was looking for this thing that only fools seem to look for
the internet was that amorphous blob or it was a silly black box with a blinking red light on it
it wasnt a real world out there
but in fact it is there is a real world of the internet out there and thats what i spent about two years visiting these places of the internet i was in large data centers that use as much power as the cities in which they sit and i visited places like this hudson street in new york which is one of the buildings in the world one of a very short list of buildings about a dozen buildings where more networks of the internet connect to each other than anywhere else
and that connection is an unequivocally physical process
its about the router of one network a facebook or a google or a b t or a comcast or a time warner whatever it is connecting with usually a yellow fiber optic cable up into the ceiling and down into the router of another network and thats unequivocally physical and its surprisingly intimate
a building like hudson and a dozen or so others has times more networks connecting within it than the next tier of buildings
theres a very short list of these places
and hudson in particular is interesting because its home to about a half a dozen very important networks which are the networks which serve the undersea cables that travel underneath the ocean that connect europe and america and connect all of us
and its those cables in particular that i want to focus on
if the internet is a global phenomenon if we live in a global village its because there are cables underneath the ocean cables like this
and in this dimension they are incredibly small
you can you hold them in your hand theyre like a garden hose
but in the other dimension they are incredibly expansive as expansive as you can imagine
they stretch across the ocean theyre three or five or eight thousand miles in length and if the material science and the computational technology is incredibly complicated the basic physical process is shockingly simple light goes in on one end of the ocean and comes out on the other and it usually comes from a building called a landing station thats often tucked away inconspicuously in a little seaside neighborhood and there are amplifiers that sit on the ocean floor that look kind of like bluefin tuna and every miles they amplify the signal and since the rate of transmission is incredibly fast the basic unit is a gigabit per second wavelength of light maybe a thousand times your own connection or capable of carrying video streams but not only that but youll put not just one wavelength of light through one of the fibers but youll put maybe or or different wavelengths or colors of light through a single fiber and then youll have maybe eight fibers in a cable four going in each direction
and theyre tiny theyre the thickness of a hair
and then they connect to the continent somewhere
they connect in a manhole like this literally this is where the mile cable plugs in
this is in halifax a cable that stretches from halifax to ireland
and the landscape is changing three years ago when i started thinking about this there was one cable down the western coast of africa represented in this map by steve song as that thin black line
now there are six cables and more coming three down each coast
because once a country gets plugged in by one cable they realize that its not enough if theyre going to build an industry around it they need to know that their connection isnt tenuous but permanent because if a cable breaks you have to send a ship out into the water throw a grappling hook over the side pick it up find the other end and then fuse the two ends back together and then dump it over
its an intensely intensely physical process
so this is my friend simon cooper who until very recently worked for tata communications the communications wing of tata the big indian industrial conglomerate
and ive never met him weve only communicated via this telepresence system which always makes me think of him as the man inside the internet
and he is english the undersea cable industry is dominated by englishmen and they all seem to be
because they all started at the same time with the boom about years ago
and tata had gotten its start as a communications business when they bought two cables one across the atlantic and one across the pacific and proceeded to add pieces onto them until they had built a belt around the world which means they will send your bits to the east or the west
they have this is literally a beam of light around the world and if a cable breaks in the pacific itll send it around the other direction and then having done that they started to look for places to wire next
they looked for the unwired places and thats meant north and south primarily these cables to africa
but what amazes me is simons incredible geographic imagination
he thinks about the world with this incredible expansiveness
and i was particularly interested because i wanted to see one of these cables being built see you know all the time online we experience these fleeting moments of connection these sort of brief adjacencies a tweet or a facebook post or an email and it seemed like there was a physical corollary to that
it seemed like there was a moment when the continent was being plugged in and i wanted to see that
and simon was working on a new cable wacs the west africa cable system that stretched from lisbon down the west coast of africa to cote divoire to ghana to nigeria to cameroon
and he said there was coming soon depending on the weather but hed let me know when and so with about four days notice he said to go to this beach south of lisbon and a little after this guy will walk out of the water
and hell be carrying a green nylon line a lightweight line called a messenger line and that was the first link between sea and land this link that would then be leveraged into this mile path of light
then a bulldozer began to pull the cable in from this specialized cable landing ship and it was floated on these buoys until it was in the right place
then you can see the english engineers looking on
and then once it was in the right place he got back in the water holding a big knife and he cut each buoy off and the buoy popped up into the air and the cable dropped to the sea floor and he did that all the way out to the ship and when he got there they gave him a glass of juice and a cookie and then he jumped back in and he swam back to shore and then he lit a cigarette
and then once that cable was on shore they began to prepare to connect it to the other side for the cable that had been brought down from the landing station
and first they got it with a hacksaw and then they start sort of shaving away at this plastic interior with a sort of working like chefs and then finally theyre working like jewelers to get these hair thin fibers to line up with the cable that had come down and with this hole punch machine they fuse it together
and when you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw you stop thinking about the internet as a cloud
it starts to seem like an incredibly physical thing
and what surprised me as well was that as much as this is based on the most sophisticated technology as much as this is an incredibly new thing the physical process itself has been around for a long time and the culture is the same
you see the local laborers you see the english engineer giving directions in the background and more importantly the places are the same these cables still connect these classic port cities places like lisbon mombasa mumbai singapore new york
and then the process on shore takes around three or four days and then when its done they put the manhole cover back on top and they push the sand over that and we all forget about it
and it seems to me that we talk a lot about the cloud but every time we put something on the cloud we give up some responsibility for it
we are less connected to it we let other people worry about it
and that doesnt seem right
theres a great neal stephenson line where he says that wired people should know something about wires
and we should know i think we should know where our internet comes from and we should know what it is that physically physically connects us all
thank you
thanks

title dayananda saraswati the profound journey of compassion title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript swami dayananda saraswati unravels the parallel paths of personal development and attaining true compassion he walks us through each step of self realization from helpless infancy to the fearless act of caring for others description
a human child is born and for quite a long time is a consumer
it cannot be consciously a contributor
it is helpless
it doesnt know how to survive even though it is endowed with an instinct to survive
it needs the help of mother or a foster mother to survive
it cant afford to doubt the person who tends the child
it has to totally surrender as one surrenders to an anesthesiologist
it has to totally surrender
that implies a lot of trust
that implies the trusted person wont violate the trust
as the child grows it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust
it doesnt know even the word violation
therefore it has to blame itself a wordless blame which is more difficult to really resolve the wordless self blame
as the child grows to become an adult so far it has been a consumer but the growth of a human being lies in his or her capacity to contribute to be a contributor
one cannot contribute unless one feels secure one feels big one feels i have enough
to be compassionate is not a joke
its not that simple
one has to discover a certain bigness in oneself
that bigness should be centered on oneself not in terms of money not in terms of power you wield not in terms of any status that you can command in the society but it should be centered on oneself
the self you are self aware
on that self it should be centered a bigness a wholeness
otherwise compassion is just a word and a dream
you can be compassionate occasionally more moved by empathy than by compassion
thank god we are empathetic
when somebodys in pain we pick up the pain
in a wimbledon final match these two guys fight it out
each one has got two games
it can be anybodys game
what they have sweated so far has no meaning
one person wins
the tennis etiquette is both the players have to come to the net and shake hands
the winner boxes the air and kisses the ground throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it
and this guy has to come to the net
when he comes to the net you see his whole face changes
it looks as though hes wishing that he didnt win
why empathy
thats human heart
no human heart is denied of that empathy
no religion can demolish that by indoctrination
no culture no nation and nationalism nothing can touch it because it is empathy
and that capacity to empathize is the window through which you reach out to people you do something that makes a difference in somebodys life even words even time
compassion is not defined in one form
theres no indian compassion
theres no american compassion
it transcends nation the gender the age
why because it is there in everybody
its experienced by people occasionally
then this occasional compassion we are not talking about it will never remain occasional
by mandate you cannot make a person compassionate
you cant say please love me
love is something you discover
its not an action but in the english language it is also an action
i will come to it later
so one has got to discover a certain wholeness
i am going to cite the possibility of being whole which is within our experience everybodys experience
in spite of a very tragic life one is happy in moments which are very few and far between
and the one who is happy even for a slapstick joke accepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself
that means the whole universe known things and unknown things
all of them are totally accepted because you discover your wholeness in yourself
the subject me and the object the scheme of things fuse into oneness an experience nobody can say i am denied of an experience common to all and sundry
that experience confirms that in spite of all your limitations all your wants desires unfulfilled and the credit cards and layoffs and finally baldness you can be happy
but the extension of the logic is that you dont need to fulfill your desire to be happy
you are the very happiness the wholeness that you want to be
theres no choice in this that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from you cannot be minus you
it has got to be you
you cannot be a part of wholeness and still be whole
your moment of happiness reveals that reality that realization that recognition maybe i am the whole
maybe the swami is right
maybe the swami is right you start your new life
then everything becomes meaningful
i have no more reason to blame myself
if one has to blame oneself one has a million reasons plus many
but if i say in spite of my body being limited if it is black it is not white if it is white it is not black body is limited any which way you look at it limited
your knowledge is limited health is limited and power is therefore limited and the cheerfulness is going to be limited
compassion is going to be limited
everything is going to be limitless
you cannot command compassion unless you become limitless and nobody can become limitless either you are or you are not period
and there is no way of your being not limitless too
your own experience reveals in spite of all limitations you are the whole
and the wholeness is the reality of you when you relate to the world
it is love first
when you relate to the world the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness is what we say love
and itself becomes compassion if the object that you relate to evokes that emotion
then that again transforms into giving into sharing
you express yourself because you have compassion
to discover compassion you need to be compassionate
to discover the capacity to give and share you need to be giving and sharing
there is no shortcut it is like swimming by swimming
you learn swimming by swimming
you cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water
you learn swimming by swimming you learn cycling by cycling
you learn cooking by cooking having some sympathetic people around you to eat what you cook
and therefore what i say you have to fake it and make it
you need to
my predecessor meant that
you have to act it out
you have to act compassionately
there is no verb for compassion but you have an adverb for compassion
thats interesting to me
you act compassionately
but then how to act compassionately if you dont have compassion
that is where you fake
you fake it and make it this is the mantra of the united states of america
you fake it and make it
you act compassionately as though you have compassion grind your teeth take all the support system
if you know how to pray pray
ask for compassion
let me act compassionately
do it
youll discover compassion and also slowly a relative compassion and slowly perhaps if you get the right teaching youll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation of the reality of yourself which is oneness wholeness and thats what you are
with these words thank you very much

title edith widder how we found the giant squid title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript humankind has been looking for the giant squid since we first started taking pictures underwater but the elusive deep sea predator could never be caught on film oceanographer and inventor edith widder shares the key insight and the teamwork that helped to capture the squid on film for the first time description
the kraken a beast so terrifying it was said to devour men and ships and whales and so enormous it could be mistaken for an island
in assessing the merits of such tales its probably wise to keep in mind that old sailors saw that the only difference between a fairytale and a sea story is a fairytale begins once upon a time and a sea story begins this aint no shit
every fish that gets away grows with every telling of the tale
nevertheless there are giants in the ocean and we now have video proof as those of you that saw the discovery channel documentary are no doubt aware
i was one of the three scientists on this expedition that took place last summer off japan
im the short one
the other two are dr tsunemi kubodera and dr steve oshea
i owe my participation in this now historic event to ted
in there was a ted event called mission blue held aboard the lindblad explorer in the galapagos as part of the fulfillment of sylvia earles ted wish
i spoke about a new way of exploring the ocean one that focuses on attracting animals instead of scaring them away
mike degruy was also invited and he spoke with great passion about his love of the ocean and he also talked to me about applying my approach to something hes been involved with for a very long time which is the hunt for the giant squid
it was mike that got me invited to the squid summit a gathering of squid experts at the discovery channel that summer during shark week
i gave a talk on unobtrusive viewing and optical luring of deep sea squid in which i emphasized the importance of using quiet unobtrusive platforms for exploration
this came out of hundreds of dives i have made farting around in the dark using these platforms and my impression that i saw more animals working from the submersible than i did with either of the remote operated vehicles
but that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view
but i also felt like i saw more animals working with the tiburon than the ventana two vehicles with the same field of view but different propulsion systems
so my suspicion was that it might have something to do with the amount of noise they make
so i set up a hydrophone on the bottom of the ocean and i had each of these fly by at the same speed and distance and recorded the sound they made
the johnson sea link which you can probably just barely hear here uses electric thrusters very very quiet
the tiburon also uses electric powered thrusters
its also pretty quiet but a bit noisier
but most deep diving rovs these days use hydraulics and they sound like the ventana
i think thats got to be scaring a lot of animals away
so for the deep sea squid hunt i proposed using an optical lure attached to a camera platform with no thrusters no motors just a battery powered camera and the only illumination coming from red light thats invisible to most deep sea animals that are adapted to see primarily blue
thats visible to our eye but its the equivalent of infrared in the deep sea
so this camera platform which we called the medusa could just be thrown off the back of the ship attached to a float at the surface with over feet of line it would just float around passively carried by the currents and the only light visible to the animals in the deep would be the blue light of the optical lure which we called the electronic jellyfish or e jelly because it was designed to imitate the bioluminescent display of the common deep sea jellyfish atolla
now this pinwheel of light that the atolla produces is known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and is a form of defense
the reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure is not because giant squid eat jellyfish but its because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light when its being chewed on by a predator and its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of a larger predator that will attack its attacker and thereby afford it an opportunity for escape
its a scream for help a last ditch attempt for escape and a common form of defense in the deep sea
the approach worked
whereas all previous expeditions had failed to garner a single video glimpse of the giant we managed six and the first triggered wild excitement
edith widder oh my god oh my god are you kidding me other scientists oh ho ho thats just hanging there
ew it was like it was teasing us doing a kind of fan dance now you see me now you dont and we had four such teasing appearances and then on the fifth it came in and totally wowed us
narrator scientists ooh bang oh my god whoa
ew the full monty
what really wowed me about that was the way it came in up over the e jelly and then attacked the enormous thing next to it which i think it mistook for the predator on the e jelly
but even more incredible was the footage shot from the triton submersible
what was not mentioned in the discovery documentary was that the bait squid that dr kubodera used a one meter long diamondback squid had a light attached to it a squid jig of the type that longline fishermen use and i think it was this light that brought the giant in
now what youre seeing is the intensified cameras view under red light and thats all dr kubodera could see when the giant comes in here
and then he got so excited he turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better and the giant didnt run away so he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible bringing a creature of legend from the misty history into high resolution video
it was absolutely breathtaking and had this animal had its feeding tentacles intact and fully extended it would have been as tall as a two story house
how could something that big live in our ocean and yet remain unfilmed until now
weve only explored about five percent of our ocean
there are great discoveries yet to be made down there fantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution and possibly bioactive compounds that could benefit us in ways that we cant even yet imagine
yet we have spent only a tiny fraction of the money on ocean exploration that weve spent on space exploration
we need a nasa like organization for ocean exploration because we need to be exploring and protecting our life support systems here on earth
we need thank you
exploration is the engine that drives innovation
innovation drives economic growth
so lets all go exploring but lets do it in a way that doesnt scare the animals away or as mike degruy once said if you want to get away from it all and see something youve never seen or have an excellent chance of seeing something that no ones ever seen get in a sub
he should have been with us for this adventure
we miss him

title sergey brin why google glass title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript its not a demo more of a philosophical argument why did sergey brin and his team at google want to build an eye mounted camera computer codenamed glass onstage at brin calls for a new way of seeing our relationship with our mobile computers not hunched over a screen but meeting the world heads up description
okay its great to be back at ted
why dont i just start by firing away with the video
man okay glass record a video
woman this is it were on in two minutes
man okay glass hang out with the flying club
man google photos of tiger heads hmm
man you ready you ready
woman right there okay glass take a picture
man go
man holy that is awesome
child whoa look at that snake
woman okay glass record a video
man after this bridge first exit
man okay right there
man google say delicious in thai
google glass อร่อยman mmm อร่อย
woman google jellyfish
man its beautiful
sergey brin oh sorry i just got this message from a nigerian prince
he needs help getting million dollars
i like to pay attention to these because thats how we originally funded the company and its gone pretty well
this position that you just saw me in looking down at my phone thats one of the reasons behind this project project glass
because we ultimately questioned whether this is the ultimate future of how you want to connect to other people in your life how you want to connect to information
should it be by just walking around looking down
but that was the vision behind glass and thats why weve created this form factor
okay and i dont want to go through all the things it does and whatnot but i want to tell you a little bit more about the motivation behind what led to it
in addition to potentially socially isolating yourself when youre out and about looking at your phone its kind of is this what youre meant to do with your body
youre standing around there and youre just rubbing this featureless piece of glass
youre just kind of moving around
so when we developed glass we thought really about can we make something that frees your hands
you saw all of the things people are doing in the video back there
they were all wearing glass and thats how we got that footage
and also you want something that frees your eyes
thats why we put the display up high out of your line of sight so it wouldnt be where youre looking and it wouldnt be where youre making eye contact with people
and also we wanted to free up the ears so the sound actually goes through conducts straight to the bones in your cranium which is a little bit freaky at first but you get used to it
and ironically if you want to hear it better you actually just cover your ear which is kind of surprising but thats how it works
my vision when we started google years ago was that eventually you wouldnt have to have a search query at all
youd just have information come to you as you needed it
and this is now years later sort of the first form factor that i think can deliver that vision when youre out and about on the street talking to people and so forth
this project has lasted now been just over two years
weve learned an amazing amount
its been really important to make it comfortable
so our first prototypes we built were huge
it was like cell phones strapped to your head
it was very heavy pretty uncomfortable
we had to keep it secret from our industrial designer until she actually accepted the job and then she almost ran away screaming
but weve come a long way
and the other really unexpected surprise was the camera
our original prototypes didnt have cameras at all but its been really magical to be able to capture moments spent with my family my kids
i just never would have dug out a camera or a phone or something else to take that moment
and lastly ive realized in experimenting with this device that i also kind of have a nervous tic
the cell phone is yeah you have to look down on it and all that but its also kind of a nervous habit
like if i smoked id probably just smoke instead
i would just light up a cigarette it would look cooler
you know id be like but in this case you know i whip this out and i sit there and look as if i have something very important to do or attend to
but it really opened my eyes to how much of my life i spent just secluding away be it email or social posts or whatnot even though it wasnt really theres nothing really that important or that pressing
and with this i know i will get certain messages if i really need them but i dont have to be checking them all the time
yeah ive really enjoyed actually exploring the world more doing more of the crazy things like you saw in the video
thank you all very much

title daphne koller what were learning from online education title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript daphne koller is enticing top universities to put their most intriguing courses online for free not just as a service but as a way to research how people learn with coursera each keystroke quiz peer to peer discussion and self graded assignment builds an unprecedented pool of data on how knowledge is processed description
like many of you im one of the lucky people
i was born to a family where education was pervasive
im a third generation phd a daughter of two academics
in my childhood i played around in my fathers university lab
so it was taken for granted that i attend some of the best universities which in turn opened the door to a world of opportunity
unfortunately most of the people in the world are not so lucky
in some parts of the world for example south africa education is just not readily accessible
in south africa the educational system was constructed in the days of apartheid for the white minority
and as a consequence today there is just not enough spots for the many more people who want and deserve a high quality education
that scarcity led to a crisis in january of this year at the university of johannesburg
there were a handful of positions left open from the standard admissions process and the night before they were supposed to open that for registration thousands of people lined up outside the gate in a line a mile long hoping to be first in line to get one of those positions
when the gates opened there was a stampede and people were injured and one woman died
she was a mother who gave her life trying to get her son a chance at a better life
but even in parts of the world like the united states where education is available it might not be within reach
there has been much discussed in the last few years about the rising cost of health care
what might not be quite as obvious to people is that during that same period the cost of higher education tuition has been increasing at almost twice the rate for a total of percent since
this makes education unaffordable for many people
finally even for those who do manage to get the higher education the doors of opportunity might not open
only a little over half of recent college graduates in the united states who get a higher education actually are working in jobs that require that education
this of course is not true for the students who graduate from the top institutions but for many others they do not get the value for their time and their effort
tom friedman in his recent new york times article captured in the way that no one else could the spirit behind our effort
he said the big breakthroughs are what happen when what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately necessary
ive talked about whats desperately necessary
lets talk about whats suddenly possible
whats suddenly possible was demonstrated by three big stanford classes each of which had an enrollment of people or more
so to understand this lets look at one of those classes the machine learning class offered by my colleague and cofounder andrew ng
andrew teaches one of the bigger stanford classes
its a machine learning class and it has people enrolled every time its offered
when andrew taught the machine learning class to the general public it had people registered
so to put that number in perspective for andrew to reach that same size audience by teaching a stanford class he would have to do that for years
of course hed get really bored
so having seen the impact of this andrew and i decided that we needed to really try and scale this up to bring the best quality education to as many people as we could
so we formed coursera whose goal is to take the best courses from the best instructors at the best universities and provide it to everyone around the world for free
we currently have courses on the platform from four universities across a range of disciplines and let me show you a little bit of an overview of what that looks like
robert ghrist welcome to calculus
ezekiel emanuel fifty million people are uninsured
scott page models help us design more effective institutions and policies
we get unbelievable segregation
scott klemmer so bush imagined that in the future youd wear a camera right in the center of your head
mitchell duneier mills wants the student of sociology to develop the quality of mind
rg hanging cable takes on the form of a hyperbolic cosine
nick parlante for each pixel in the image set the red to zero
paul offit vaccine allowed us to eliminate polio virus
dan jurafsky does lufthansa serve breakfast and san jose well that sounds funny
daphne koller so this is which coin you pick and this is the two tosses
andrew ng so in large scale machine learning wed like to come up with computational
dk it turns out maybe not surprisingly that students like getting the best content from the best universities for free
since we opened the website in february we now have students from countries
we have million enrollments million quizzes in the classes that have launched so far have been submitted and million videos have been viewed
but its not just about the numbers its also about the people
whether its akash who comes from a small town in india and would never have access in this case to a stanford quality course and would never be able to afford it
or jenny who is a single mother of two and wants to hone her skills so that she can go back and complete her masters degree
or ryan who cant go to school because his immune deficient daughter cant be risked to have germs come into the house so he couldnt leave the house
im really glad to say recently weve been in correspondence with ryan that this story had a happy ending
baby shannon you can see her on the left is doing much better now and ryan got a job by taking some of our courses
so what made these courses so different
after all online course content has been available for a while
what made it different was that this was real course experience
it started on a given day and then the students would watch videos on a weekly basis and do homework assignments
and these would be real homework assignments for a real grade with a real deadline
you can see the deadlines and the usage graph
these are the spikes showing that procrastination is global phenomenon
at the end of the course the students got a certificate
they could present that certificate to a prospective employer and get a better job and we know many students who did
some students took their certificate and presented this to an educational institution at which they were enrolled for actual college credit
so these students were really getting something meaningful for their investment of time and effort
lets talk a little bit about some of the components that go into these courses
the first component is that when you move away from the constraints of a physical classroom and design content explicitly for an online format you can break away from for example the monolithic one hour lecture
you can break up the material for example into these short modular units of eight to minutes each of which represents a coherent concept
students can traverse this material in different ways depending on their background their skills or their interests
so for example some students might benefit from a little bit of preparatory material that other students might already have
other students might be interested in a particular enrichment topic that they want to pursue individually
so this format allows us to break away from the one size fits all model of education and allows students to follow a much more personalized curriculum
of course we all know as educators that students dont learn by sitting and passively watching videos
perhaps one of the biggest components of this effort is that we need to have students who practice with the material in order to really understand it
theres been a range of studies that demonstrate the importance of this
this one that appeared in science last year for example demonstrates that even simple retrieval practice where students are just supposed to repeat what they already learned gives considerably improved results on various achievement tests down the line than many other educational interventions
weve tried to build in retrieval practice into the platform as well as other forms of practice in many ways
for example even our videos are not just videos
every few minutes the video pauses and the students get asked a question
sp these four things prospect theory hyperbolic discounting status quo bias base rate bias theyre all well documented
so theyre all well documented deviations from rational behavior
dk so here the video pauses and the student types in the answer into the box and submits obviously they werent paying attention
so they get to try again and this time they got it right
theres an optional explanation if they want
and now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture
this is a kind of simple question that i as an instructor might ask in class but when i ask that kind of a question in class percent of the students are still scribbling the last thing i said percent are zoned out on facebook and then theres the smarty pants in the front row who blurts out the answer before anyone else has had a chance to think about it and i as the instructor am terribly gratified that somebody actually knew the answer
and so the lecture moves on before really most of the students have even noticed that a question had been asked
here every single student has to engage with the material
and of course these simple retrieval questions are not the end of the story
one needs to build in much more meaningful practice questions and one also needs to provide the students with feedback on those questions
now how do you grade the work of students if you do not have tas
the answer is you need to use technology to do it for you
now fortunately technology has come a long way and we can now grade a range of interesting types of homework
in addition to multiple choice and the kinds of short answer questions that you saw in the video we can also grade math mathematical expressions as well as mathematical derivations
we can grade models whether its financial models in a business class or physical models in a science or engineering class and we can grade some pretty sophisticated programming assignments
let me show you one thats actually pretty simple but fairly visual
this is from stanfords computer science class and the students are supposed to color correct that blurry red image
theyre typing their program into the browser and you can see they didnt get it quite right lady liberty is still seasick
and so the student tries again and now they got it right and theyre told that and they can move on to the next assignment
this ability to interact actively with the material and be told when youre right or wrong is really essential to student learning
now of course we cannot yet grade the range of work that one needs for all courses
specifically whats lacking is the kind of critical thinking work that is so essential in such disciplines as the humanities the social sciences business and others
so we tried to convince for example some of our humanities faculty that multiple choice was not such a bad strategy
that didnt go over really well
so we had to come up with a different solution
and the solution we ended up using is peer grading
it turns out that previous studies show like this one by saddler and good that peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy for providing reproducible grades
it was tried only in small classes but there it showed for example that these student assigned grades on the y axis are actually very well correlated with the teacher assigned grade on the x axis
whats even more surprising is that self grades where the students grade their own work critically so long as you incentivize them properly so they cant give themselves a perfect score are actually even better correlated with the teacher grades
and so this is an effective strategy that can be used for grading at scale and is also a useful learning strategy for the students because they actually learn from the experience
so we now have the largest peer grading pipeline ever devised where tens of thousands of students are grading each others work and quite successfully i have to say
but this is not just about students sitting alone in their living room working through problems
around each one of our courses a community of students had formed a global community of people around a shared intellectual endeavor
what you see here is a self generated map from students in our princeton sociology course where they have put themselves on a world map and you can really see the global reach of this kind of effort
students collaborated in these courses in a variety of different ways
first of all there was a question and answer forum where students would pose questions and other students would answer those questions
and the really amazing thing is because there were so many students it means that even if a student posed a question at oclock in the morning somewhere around the world there would be somebody who was awake and working on the same problem
and so in many of our courses the median response time for a question on the question and answer forum was minutes
which is not a level of service i have ever offered to my stanford students
and you can see from the student testimonials that students actually find that because of this large online community they got to interact with each other in many ways that were deeper than they did in the context of the physical classroom
students also self assembled without any kind of intervention from us into small study groups
some of these were physical study groups along geographical constraints and met on a weekly basis to work through problem sets
this is the san francisco study group but there were ones all over the world
others were virtual study groups sometimes along language lines or along cultural lines and on the bottom left there you see our multicultural universal study group where people explicitly wanted to connect with people from other cultures
there are some tremendous opportunities to be had from this kind of framework
the first is that it has the potential of giving us a completely unprecedented look into understanding human learning
because the data that we can collect here is unique
you can collect every click every homework submission every forum post from tens of thousands of students
so you can turn the study of human learning from the hypothesis driven mode to the data driven mode a transformation that for example has revolutionized biology
you can use these data to understand fundamental questions like what are good learning strategies that are effective versus ones that are not
and in the context of particular courses you can ask questions like what are some of the misconceptions that are more common and how do we help students fix them
so heres an example of that also from andrews machine learning class
this is a distribution of wrong answers to one of andrews assignments
the answers happen to be pairs of numbers so you can draw them on this two dimensional plot
each of the little crosses that you see is a different wrong answer
the big cross at the top left is where students gave the exact same wrong answer
now if two students in a class of give the same wrong answer you would never notice
but when students give the same wrong answer its kind of hard to miss
so andrew and his students went in looked at some of those assignments understood the root cause of the misconception and then they produced a targeted error message that would be provided to every student whose answer fell into that bucket which means that students who made that same mistake would now get personalized feedback telling them how to fix their misconception much more effectively
so this personalization is something that one can then build by having the virtue of large numbers
personalization is perhaps one of the biggest opportunities here as well because it provides us with the potential of solving a year old problem
educational researcher benjamin bloom in posed whats called the sigma problem which he observed by studying three populations
the first is the population that studied in a lecture based classroom
the second is a population of students that studied using a standard lecture based classroom but with a mastery based approach so the students couldnt move on to the next topic before demonstrating mastery of the previous one
and finally there was a population of students that were taught in a one on one instruction using a tutor
the mastery based population was a full standard deviation or sigma in achievement scores better than the standard lecture based class and the individual tutoring gives you sigma improvement in performance
to understand what that means lets look at the lecture based classroom and lets pick the median performance as a threshold
so in a lecture based class half the students are above that level and half are below
in the individual tutoring instruction percent of the students are going to be above that threshold
imagine if we could teach so that percent of our students would be above average
hence the sigma problem
because we cannot afford as a society to provide every student with an individual human tutor
but maybe we can afford to provide each student with a computer or a smartphone
so the question is how can we use technology to push from the left side of the graph from the blue curve to the right side with the green curve
mastery is easy to achieve using a computer because a computer doesnt get tired of showing you the same video five times
and it doesnt even get tired of grading the same work multiple times weve seen that in many of the examples that ive shown you
and even personalization is something that were starting to see the beginnings of whether its via the personalized trajectory through the curriculum or some of the personalized feedback that weve shown you
so the goal here is to try and push and see how far we can get towards the green curve
so if this is so great are universities now obsolete
well mark twain certainly thought so
he said that college is a place where a professors lecture notes go straight to the students lecture notes without passing through the brains of either
i beg to differ with mark twain though
i think what he was complaining about is not universities but rather the lecture based format that so many universities spend so much time on
so lets go back even further to plutarch who said that the mind is not a vessel that needs filling but wood that needs igniting
and maybe we should spend less time at universities filling our students minds with content by lecturing at them and more time igniting their creativity their imagination and their problem solving skills by actually talking with them
so how do we do that
we do that by doing active learning in the classroom
so theres been many studies including this one that show that if you use active learning interacting with your students in the classroom performance improves on every single metric on attendance on engagement and on learning as measured by a standardized test
you can see for example that the achievement score almost doubles in this particular experiment
so maybe this is how we should spend our time at universities
so to summarize if we could offer a top quality education to everyone around the world for free what would that do three things
first it would establish education as a fundamental human right where anyone around the world with the ability and the motivation could get the skills that they need to make a better life for themselves their families and their communities
second it would enable lifelong learning
its a shame that for so many people learning stops when we finish high school or when we finish college
by having this amazing content be available we would be able to learn something new every time we wanted whether its just to expand our minds or its to change our lives
and finally this would enable a wave of innovation because amazing talent can be found anywhere
maybe the next albert einstein or the next steve jobs is living somewhere in a remote village in africa
and if we could offer that person an education they would be able to come up with the next big idea and make the world a better place for all of us
thank you very much

title maurizio seracini the secret lives of paintings title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript art history is far from set in stone engineer maurizio seracini spent years searching for leonardo da vinci s lost fresco the battle of anghiari and in the process discovered that many paintings have layers of history hidden underneath should they be part of the viewing experience too description
in i met in florence a professor carlo pedretti my former professor of art history and today a world renowned scholar of leonardo da vinci
well he asked me if i could find some technological way to unfold a five centuries old mystery related to a lost masterpiece by leonardo da vinci the battle of anghiari which is supposed to be located in the hall of the in palazzo vecchio in florence
well in the mid there were not great opportunities for a bioengineer like me especially in italy and so i decided with some researchers from the united states and the university of florence to start probing the murals decorated by vasari on the long walls of the hall of the searching for the lost leonardo
unfortunately at that time we did not know that that was not exactly where we should be looking because we had to go much deeper in and so the research came to a halt and it was only taken up in thanks to the interest and the enthusiasm of the guinness family
well this time we focused on trying to reconstruct the way the hall of the was before the remodeling and the so called sala grande which was built in and to find out the original doors windows and in order to do that we first created a model and then with thermography we went on to discover hidden windows these are the original windows of the hall of the sala grande we also found out about the height of the ceiling and we managed to reconstruct therefore all the layout of this original hall the way it was before there came vasari and restructured the whole thing including a staircase that was very important in order to precisely place the battle of anghiari on a specific area of one of the two walls
well we also learned that vasari who was commissioned to remodel the hall of the between and by the grand duke cosimo i of the medici family we have at least two instances when he saved masterpieces specifically by placing a brick wall in front of it and leaving a small air gap
one that we here masaccio the church of santa maria novella in florence so we just said well maybe visari has done something like that in the case of this great work of art by leonardo since he was a great admirer of leonardo da vinci
and so we built some very sophisticated radio antennas just for probing both walls and searching for an air gap
and we did find many on the right panel of the east wall an air gap and thats where we believe the battle of anghiari or at least the part that we know has been painted which is called the fight for the standard should be located
well from there unfortunately in the project came to a halt many political reasons
so i decided to go back to my alma mater and at the university of california san diego and i proposed to open up a research center for engineering sciences for cultural heritage
and in we created as a research center for cultural heritage specifically art architecture and archaeology so students started to flow in and we started to build technologies because thats basically what we also needed in order to move forward and go and do fieldwork
we came back in the hall of the in and this time with a great group of students and my colleague professor falko kuester who is now the director at and we came back just since we knew already where to look for to find out if there was still something left
well we were confined though limited i should rather say for several reasons that its not worth explaining to endoscopy only of the many other options we had and with a camera attached to it we were successful in documenting and taking some fragments of what it turns out to be a reddish color black color and there is some beige fragments that later on we ran a much more sophisticated exams xrf x ray diffraction and the results are very positive so far it seems to indicate that indeed we have found some pigments and since we know for sure that no other artist has painted on that wall before vasari came in about years later well those pigments are therefore firmly related to mural painting and most likely to leonardo
well we are searching for the highest and highly praised work of art ever achieved by mankind
as a matter of fact this is by far the most important commission that leonardo has ever had and for doing this great masterpiece he was named the number one artist influence at the time
i had also had the privilege since the last years to work on several masterpieces as you can see behind me but basically to do what well to assess for example the state of conservation see here the face of the madonna of the chair that when just shining a uv light on it you suddenly see another different lady aged lady i should rather say
there is a lot of varnish still sitting there several retouches and some over cleaning it becomes very visible
but also technology has helped to write new pages of our history or at least to update pages of our histories
for example the lady with the unicorn another painting by rafael well you see the unicorn
a lot has been said and written about the unicorn but if you take an x ray of the unicorn it becomes a puppy dog
and no problem but unfortunately continuing with the scientific examination of this painting came out that rafael did not paint the unicorn did not paint the puppy dog actually left the painting unfinished so all this writing about the exotic symbol of the unicorn unfortunately is not very reliable
well also authenticity just think for a moment if science really could move in the field of authenticity of works of art there would be a cultural revolution to say the least but also i would say a market revolution let me add take this example otto marseus nice painting which is still life at the pitti gallery and just have an infrared camera peering through and luckily for art historians it just was confirmed that there is a signature of otto marseus it even says when it was made and also the location
so that was a good result sometimes its not that good and so again authenticity and science could go together and change the way not attributions being made but at least lay the ground for a more objective or i should rather say less subjective attribution as it is done today
but i would say the discovery that really caught my imagination my admiration is the incredibly vivid drawing under this layer brown layer of the adoration of the magi here you see a handmade setting xyz scanner with an infrared camera put on it and just peering through this brown layer of this masterpiece to reveal what could have been underneath
well this happens to be the most important painting we have in italy by leonardo da vinci and look at the wonderful images of faces that nobody has seen for five centuries look at these portraits
theyre magnificent you see leonardo at work
you see the geniality of his creation right directly on the ground layer of the panel and see this cool thing finding i should rather say an elephant because of this elephant over new images came out never seen for centuries
this was an epiphany we came to understand and to prove that the brown coating that we see today was not done by leonardo da vinci which left us only the other drawing that for five centuries we were not able to see so thanks only to technology
well the tablet well we thought well if we all have this pleasure this privilege to see all this to find all these discoveries what about for everybody else
so we thought of an augmented reality application using a tablet let me show you just simulating what we could be doing any of us could be doing in a museum environment
so lets say that we go to a museum with a tablet okay
and we just aim the camera of the tablet to the painting that we are interested to see like this
okay and i will just click on it we pause and now let me turn to you so the moment the image or i should say the camera has locked in the painting then the images you just saw up there in the drawing are being loaded and so see
we can as we said we can zoom in then we can scroll
okay lets go and find the elephant
so all we need is one finger just wipe off and we see the elephant
okay and then if we want we can continue the scroll to find out for example on the staircase the whole iconography is going to be changed there are a lot of laymen reconstructing from the ruins of an old temple a new temple and there are a lot of figures showing up see
this is not just a curiosity because it changes not just the iconography as you see it but the iconology the meaning of the painting and we believe this is a cool way easy way that everybody could have access to to become more the protagonist of your own discovery and not just be so passive about it as we are when we walk through endless rooms of museums
another concept is the digital clinical chart which sounds very obvious if we were to talk about real patients but when we talk about works of art unfortunately its never been tapped as an idea
well we believe again that this should be the beginning the very first step to do real conservation and allowing us to really explore and to understand everything related to the state of our conservation the technique materials and also if when and why we should restore or rather to intervene on the environment surrounding the painting
well our vision is to rediscover the spirit of the renaissance create a new discipline where engineering for cultural heritage is actually a symbol of blending art and science together
we definitely need a new breed of engineers that will go out and do this kind of work and rediscover for us these values these cultural values that we badly need especially today
and if you want to summarize in one just single word well this is what were trying to do
were trying to give a future to our past in order to have a future
as long as we live a life of curiosity and passion there is a bit of leonardo in all of us thank you

title eric whitacre virtual choir live title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript composer and conductor eric whitacre has inspired millions by bringing together virtual choirs singers from many countries spliced together on video now for the first time ever he creates the experience in real time as singers from around the world skype in to join an onstage choir for an epic performance of whitacres cloudburst based on a poem by octavio paz description
in i had maybe the most profound and transformative experience of my life
i was in the third year of my seven year undergraduate degree
i took a couple victory laps in there
and i was on a college choir tour up in northern california and we had stopped for the day after all day on the bus and we were relaxing next to this beautiful idyllic lake in the mountains
and there were crickets and birds and frogs making noise and as we sat there over the mountains coming in from the north were these steven spielbergian clouds rolling toward us and as the clouds got about halfway over the valley so help me god every single animal in that place stopped making noise at the same time
this electric hush as if they could sense what was about to happen
and then the clouds came over us and then boom this massive thunderclap and sheets of rain
it was just extraordinary and when i came back home i found a poem by the mexican poet octavio paz and decided to set it to music a piece for choir called cloudburst which is the piece that well perform for you in just a moment
now fast forward to just three years ago
and we released to youtube this the virtual choir project singers from different countries
you can see my little video there conducting these people alone in their dorm rooms or in their living rooms at home
two years ago on this very stage we premiered virtual choir singers from different countries this time performing a piece that i had written called sleep
and then just last spring we released virtual choir water night another piece that i had written this time nearly singers from different countries
and when i was speaking to chris about the future of virtual choir and where we might be able to take this he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could
could we do this all in real time
could we have people singing together in real time
and with the help of skype that is what we are going to attempt today
now well perform cloudburst for you
the first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage
im joined by singers from cal state long beach cal state fullerton and riverside community college some of the best amateur choirs in the country and and in the second half of the piece the virtual choir will join us different singers from different countries
now weve pushed the technology as far as it can go but theres still less than a second of latency but in musical terms thats a lifetime
we deal in milliseconds
so what ive done is ive adapted cloudburst so that it embraces the latency and the performers sing into the latency instead of trying to be exactly together
so with deep humility and for your approval we present cloudburst

description ted talk subtitles and transcript in this deceptively simple minute talk dr laura trice muses on the power of the magic words thank you to deepen a friendship to repair a bond to make sure another person knows what they mean to you try it description
hi im here to talk to you about the importance of praise admiration and thank you and having it be specific and genuine
and the way i got interested in this was i noticed in myself when i was growing up and until about a few years ago that i would want to say thank you to someone i would want to praise them i would want to take in their praise of me and id just stop it
and i asked myself why
i felt shy i felt embarrassed
and then my question became am i the only one who does this
so i decided to investigate
im fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility so i get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction
and sometimes it comes down to something as simple as their core wound is their father died without ever saying hes proud of them
but then they hear from all the family and friends that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him but he never told the son
its because he didnt know that his son needed to hear it
so my question is why dont we ask for the things that we need
i know a gentleman married for years whos longing to hear his wife say thank you for being the breadwinner so i can stay home with the kids but wont ask
i know a woman whos good at this
she once a week meets with her husband and says id really like you to thank me for all these things i did in the house and with the kids
and he goes oh this is great this is great
and praise really does have to be genuine but she takes responsibility for that
and a friend of mine april who ive had since kindergarten she thanks her children for doing their chores
and she said why wouldnt i thank it even though theyre supposed to do it
so the question is why was i blocking it
why were other people blocking it
why can i say ill take my steak medium rare i need size six shoes but i wont say would you praise me this way
and its because im giving you critical data about me
im telling you where im insecure
im telling you where i need your help
and im treating you my inner circle like youre the enemy
because what can you do with that data
you could neglect me
you could abuse it
or you could actually meet my need
and i took my bike into the bike store i love this same bike and theyd do something called truing the wheels
the guy said you know when you true the wheels its going to make the bike so much better
i get the same bike back and theyve taken all the little warps out of those same wheels ive had for two and a half years and my bike is like new
so im going to challenge all of you
i want you to true your wheels be honest about the praise that you need to hear
what do you need to hear go home to your wife go ask her what does she need
go home to your husband what does he need
go home and ask those questions and then help the people around you
and its simple
and why should we care about this
we talk about world peace
how can we have world peace with different cultures different languages
i think it starts household by household under the same roof
so lets make it right in our own backyard
and i want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands great mothers friends daughters sons
and maybe somebodys never said that to you but youve done a really really good job
and thank you for being here just showing up and changing the world with your ideas

title carter emmart a atlas of the universe title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript for the last years carter emmart has been coordinating the efforts of scientists artists and programmers to build a complete visualization of our known universe he demos this stunning tour and explains how its being shared with facilities around the world description
its a great honor today to share with you the digital universe which was created for humanity to really see where we are in the universe
and so i think we can roll the video that we have
the flat horizon that weve evolved with has been a metaphor for the infinite unbounded resources and unlimited capacity for disposal of waste
it wasnt until we really left earth got above the atmosphere and had seen the horizon bend back on itself that we could understand our planet as a limited condition
the digital universe atlas has been built at the american museum of natural history over the past years
we maintain that put that together as a project to really chart the universe across all scales
what we see here are satellites around the earth and the earth in proper registration against the universe as we see
nasa supported this work years ago as part of the rebuilding of the hayden planetarium so that we would share this with the world
the digital universe is the basis of our space show productions that we do our main space shows in the dome
but what you see here is the result of actually internships that we hosted with linkoping university in sweden
ive had students work on this for their graduate work and the result has been this software called uniview and a company called sciss in sweden
this software allows interactive use so this actual flight path and movie that we see here was actually flown live
i captured this live from my laptop in a cafe called earth matters on the lower east side of manhattan where i live and it was done as a collaborative project with the rubin museum of himalayan art for an exhibit on comparative cosmology
and so as we move out we see continuously from our planet all the way out into the realm of galaxies as we see here light travel time giving you a sense of how far away we are
the light from these distant galaxies have taken so long were essentially backing up into the past
we back so far up were finally seeing a containment around us the afterglow of the big bang
this is the wmap microwave background that we see
well fly outside it here just to see this sort of containment
if we were outside this it would almost be meaningless in the sense as before time
but this our containment of the visible universe
we know the universe is bigger than that which we can see
coming back quickly we see here the radio sphere that we jumped out of in the beginning but these are positions the latest positions of exoplanets that weve mapped and our sun here obviously with our own solar system
what youre going to see were going to have to jump in here pretty quickly between several orders of magnitude to get down to where we see the solar system these are the paths of voyager voyager pioneer and pioneer the first four spacecraft to have left the solar system
coming in closer picking up earth orbit of the moon and we see the earth
this map can be updated and we can add in new data
i know dr carolyn porco is the camera p i
for the cassini mission
but here we see the complex trajectory of the cassini mission color coded for different mission phases ingeniously developed so that encounters with the largest moon titan which is larger that the planet mercury diverts the orbit into different parts of mission phase
this software allows us to come close and look at parts of this
this software can also be networked between domes
we have a growing user base of this and we network domes
and we can network between domes and classrooms
were actually sharing tours of the universe with the first sub saharan planetarium in ghana as well as new libraries that have been built in the ghettos in columbia and a high school in cambodia
and the cambodians have actually controlled the hayden planetarium from their high school
this is an image from saturday photographed by the aqua satellite but through the uniview software
so youre seeing the edge of the earth
this is nepal
this is in fact right here is the valley of lhasa right here in tibet
but we can see the haze from fires and so forth in the ganges valley down below in india
this is nepal and tibet
and just in closing id just like to say this beautiful world that we live on here we see a bit of the snow that some of you may have had to brave in coming out so id like to just say that what the world needs now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much larger condition now and a much larger sense of what home is
because our home is the universe and we are the universe essentially
we carry that in us
and to be able to see our context in this larger sense at all scales helps us all i think in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe
thank you

title nalini nadkarni life science in prison title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript nalini nadkarni challenges our perspective on trees and prisons she says both can be more dynamic than we think through a partnership with the state of washington she brings science classes and conservation programs to inmates with unexpected results description
trees epitomize stasis
trees are rooted in the ground in one place for many human generations but if we shift our perspective from the trunk to the twigs trees become very dynamic entities moving and growing
and i decided to explore this movement by turning trees into artists
i simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig
i waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas and that produced art
the piece of art you see on your left is painted by a western red cedar and that on your right by a douglas fir and what i learned was that different species have different signatures like a picasso versus a monet
but i was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree which produced this painting moved in a single year i simply measured and summed each of those lines
i multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch and the number of branches per tree and then divided that by the number of minutes per year
and so i was able to calculate how far a single tree moved in a single year
you might have a guess
the answer is actually miles or seven times around the globe
and so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunk to the many dynamic twigs we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities but rather extremely dynamic
and i began to think about ways that we might consider this lesson of trees to consider other entities that are also static and stuck but which cry for change and dynamicism and one of those entities is our prisons
prisons of course are where people who break our laws are stuck confined behind bars
and our prison system itself is stuck
the united states has over million incarcerated men and women
that number is rising
of the incarcerated people that are released will return to prison
funds for education for training and for rehabilitation are declining so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues
i decided to ask whether the lesson i had learned from trees as artists could be applied to a static institution such as our prisons and i think the answer is yes
in the year i started a partnership with the washington state department of corrections
working with four prisons we began bringing science and scientists sustainability and conservation projects to four state prisons
we give science lectures and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures instead of watching television or weightlifting
that i think is movement
we partnered with the nature conservancy for inmates at stafford creek correctional center to grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in washington state
that i think is movement
we worked with the washington state department of fish and wildlife to grow endangered frogs the oregon spotted frog for later release into protected wetlands
that i think is movement
and just recently weve begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call supermax facilities
theyve incurred violent infractions by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners
theyre kept in bare cells like this for hours a day
when they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals theyre placed in immobile booths like this
for one hour a day theyre brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards
although we cant bring trees and prairie plants and frogs into these environments we are bringing images of nature into these exercise yards putting them on the walls so at least they get contact with visual images of nature
this is mr lopez who has been in solitary confinement for months and hes providing input on the types of images that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates more serene more calm less apt to violence
and so what we see i think is that small collective movements of change can perhaps move an entity such as our own prison system in a direction of hope
we know that trees are static entities when we look at their trunks
but if trees can create art if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs then perhaps there are other static entities that we hold inside ourselves like grief like addictions like racism that can also change

title michael hansmeyer building unimaginable shapes title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript inspired by cell division michael hansmeyer writes algorithms that design outrageously fascinating shapes and forms with millions of facets no person could draft them by hand but theyre buildable and they could revolutionize the way we think of architectural form description
as an architect i often ask myself what is the origin of the forms that we design
what kind of forms could we design if we wouldnt work with references anymore
if we had no bias if we had no preconceptions what kind of forms could we design if we could free ourselves from our experience
if we could free ourselves from our education
what would these unseen forms look like
would they surprise us would they intrigue us
would they delight us
if so then how can we go about creating something that is truly new
i propose we look to nature
nature has been called the greatest architect of forms
and im not saying that we should copy nature im not saying we should mimic biology instead i propose that we can borrow natures processes
we can abstract them and to create something that is new
natures main process of creation morphogenesis is the splitting of one cell into two cells
and these cells can either be identical or they can be distinct from each other through asymmetric cell division
if we abstract this process and simplify it as much as possible then we could start with a single sheet of paper one surface and we could make a fold and divide the surface into two surfaces
were free to choose where we make the fold
and by doing so we can differentiate the surfaces
through this very simple process we can create an astounding variety of forms
now we can take this form and use the same process to generate three dimensional structures but rather than folding things by hand well bring the structure into the computer and code it as an algorithm
and in doing so we can suddenly fold anything
we can fold a million times faster we can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations
and as were seeking to make something three dimensional we start not with a single surface but with a volume
a simple volume the cube
if we take its surfaces and fold them again and again and again and again then after iterations steps we end up with surfaces and a shape that looks for instance like this
and if we change where we make the folds if we change the folding ratio then this cube turns into this one
we can change the folding ratio again to produce this shape or this shape
so we exert control over the form by specifying the position of where were making the fold but essentially youre looking at a folded cube
and we can play with this
we can apply different folding ratios to different parts of the form to create local conditions
we can begin to sculpt the form
and because were doing the folding on the computer we are completely free of any physical constraints
so that means that surfaces can intersect themselves they can become impossibly small
we can make folds that we otherwise could not make
surfaces can become porous
they can stretch they can tear
and all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can produce
but in each case i didnt design the form
i designed the process that generated the form
in general if we make a small change to the folding ratio which is what youre seeing here then the form changes correspondingly
but thats only half of the story percent of the folding ratios produce not this but this the geometric equivalent of noise
the forms that i showed before were made actually through very long trial and error
a far more effective way to create forms i have found is to use information that is already contained in forms
a very simple form such as this one actually contains a lot of information that may not be visible to the human eye
so for instance we can plot the length of the edges
white surfaces have long edges black ones have short ones
we can plot the planarity of the surfaces their curvature how radial they are all information that may not be instantly visible to you but that we can bring out that we can articulate and that we can use to control the folding
so now im not specifying a single ratio anymore to fold it but instead im establishing a rule im establishing a link between a property of a surface and how that surface is folded
and because ive designed the process and not the form i can run the process again and again and again to produce a whole family of forms
these forms look elaborate but the process is a very minimal one
there is a simple input its always a cube that i start with and its a very simple operation its making a fold and doing this over and over again
so lets bring this process to architecture
how and at what scale
i chose to design a column
columns are architectural archetypes
theyve been used throughout history to express ideals about beauty about technology
a challenge to me was how we could express this new algorithmic order in a column
i started using four cylinders
through a lot of experimentation these cylinders eventually evolved into this
and these columns they have information at very many scales
we can begin to zoom into them
the closer one gets the more new features one discovers
some formations are almost at the threshold of human visibility
and unlike traditional architecture its a single process that creates both the overall form and the microscopic surface detail
these forms are undrawable
an architect whos drawing them with a pen and a paper would probably take months or it would take even a year to draw all the sections all of the elevations you can only create something like this through an algorithm
the more interesting question perhaps is are these forms imaginable
usually an architect can somehow envision the end state of what he is designing
in this case the process is deterministic
theres no randomness involved at all but its not entirely predictable
theres too many surfaces theres too much detail one cant see the end state
so this leads to a new role for the architect
one needs a new method to explore all of the possibilities that are out there
for one thing one can design many variants of a form in parallel and one can cultivate them
and to go back to the analogy with nature one can begin to think in terms of populations one can talk about permutations about generations about crossing and breeding to come up with a design
and the architect is really he moves into the position of being an orchestrator of all of these processes
but enough of the theory
at one point i simply wanted to jump inside this image so to say i bought these red and blue glasses got up very close to the screen but still that wasnt the same as being able to walk around and touch things
so there was only one possibility to bring the column out of the computer
theres been a lot of talk now about printing
for me or for my purpose at this moment theres still too much of an unfavorable tradeoff between scale on the one hand and resolution and speed on the other
so instead we decided to take the column and we decided to build it as a layered model made out of very many slices thinly stacked over each other
what youre looking at here is an x ray of the column that you just saw viewed from the top
unbeknownst to me at the time because we had only seen the outside the surfaces were continuing to fold themselves to grow on the inside of the column which was quite a surprising discovery
from this shape we calculated a cutting line and then we gave this cutting line to a laser cutter to produce and youre seeing a segment of it here very many thin slices individually cut on top of each other
and this is a photo now its not a rendering and the column that we ended up with after a lot of work ended up looking remarkably like the one that we had designed in the computer
almost all of the details almost all of the surface intricacies were preserved
but it was very labor intensive
theres a huge disconnect at the moment still between the virtual and the physical
it took me several months to design the column but ultimately it takes the computer about seconds to calculate all of the million faces
the physical model on the other hand is layers one millimeter thick it weighs kilos its made of sheet that can cover this entire auditorium
and the cutting path that the laser followed goes from here to the airport and back again
but it is increasingly possible
machines are getting faster its getting less expensive and theres some promising technological developments just on the horizon
these are images from the gwangju biennale
and in this case i used abs plastic to produce the columns we used the bigger faster machine and they have a steel core inside so theyre structural they can bear loads for once
each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns
you can see a different column in the mirror if theres a mirror behind the column that creates a sort of an optical illusion
so where does this leave us
i think this project gives us a glimpse of the unseen objects that await us if we as architects begin to think about designing not the object but a process to generate objects
ive shown one simple process that was inspired by nature theres countless other ones
in short we have no constraints
instead we have processes in our hands right now that allow us to create structures at all scales that we couldnt even have dreamt up
and if i may add at one point we will build them
thank you

title david hoffman sputnik mania title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript filmmaker david hoffman shares footage from his feature length documentary sputnik mania which shows how the soviet unions launch of sputnik in led to both the space race and the arms race and jump started science and math education around the world description
fifty years ago in the old soviet union a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object through a desolate countryside
with it they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere by being the first to conquer outer space
the rocket was huge
and packed in its nose was a silver ball with two radios inside
on october they launched their rocket
one of the russian scientists wrote at the time we are about to create a new planet that we will call sputnik
in the olden days explorers like vasco da gama and columbus had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe
now we have the good fortune to open up space
and it is for those in the future to envy us our joy
youre watching snippets from sputnik my fifth documentary feature which is just about completed
it tells the story of sputnik and the story of what happened to america as a result
for days after the launch sputnik was a wonderful curiosity
a man made moon visible by ordinary citizens it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space
but just three days later on a day they called red monday the media and the politicians told us and we believed that sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs using their sputnik rocket as an ibm missile
all hell broke loose
sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit america historians say the equal of pearl harbor or
it provoked the missile gap
it exploded an arms race
it began the space race
within a year congress funded huge weapons increases and we went from nuclear weapons to
and the reactions to sputnik went far beyond weapons increases
for example some here will remember this day june the national civil defense drill where tens of millions of people in cities went underground
or the gallup poll that showed that seven in americans believed that a nuclear war would happen and that at least percent of our population was going to be killed
but sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well
for example some in this room went to school on scholarship because of sputnik
support for engineering math and science education in general boomed
and vint cerf points out that sputnik led directly to arpa and the internet and of course nasa
my feature documentary shows how a free society can be stampeded by those who know how to use media
but it also shows how we can turn what appears at first to be a bad situation into something that was overall very good for america
sputnik will soon be released
in closing i would like to take a moment to thank one of my investors longtime tedster jay walker
and id like to thank you all
thank you chris

title ken kamler medical miracle on everest title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript the second deadliest day in the history of mount everest climbs happened in and ken kamler was the only doctor on the mountain that day he shares the incredible story of the climbers battle to save lives in extreme conditions and uses brain imaging technology to map the medical miracle of one man who survived roughly hours buried in the snow description
ok weve heard a lot of people speak at this conference about the power of the human mind
and what id like to do today is give you a vivid example of how that power can be unleashed when someone is in a survival situation how the will to survive can bring that out in people
this is an incident which occurred on mount everest it was the worst disaster in the history of everest
and when it occurred i was the only doctor on the mountain
so ill take you through that and well see what its like when someone really summons the will to survive
ok this is mount everest
its feet high
ive been there six times four times i did work with national geographic making tectonic plate measurements twice i went with nasa doing remote sensing devices
it was on my fourth trip to everest that a comet passed over the mountain hyakutake
and the sherpas told us then that was a very bad omen and we should have listened to them
everest is an extreme environment
theres only one third as much oxygen at the summit as there is at sea level
near the summit temperatures can be degrees below zero
you can have winds to miles an hour
its actually a wind chill factor which is lower than a summer day on mars
i remember one time being up near the summit i reached into my down jacket for a drink from my water bottle inside my down jacket only to discover that the water was already frozen solid
that gives you an idea of just how severe things are near the summit
ok this is the route up everest
it starts at base camp at feet
camp one feet higher
camp two another feet higher up whats called the western cwm
campthree is at the base of lhotse which is the fourth highest mountain in the world but its dwarfed by everest
and then camp four is the highest camp thats feet short of the summit
this is a view of base camp
this is pitched on a glacier at feet
its the highest point you can bring your yaks before you have to unload
and this is what they unloaded for me i had four yak loads of medical supplies which are dumped in a tent and here i am trying to arrange things
this was our expedition
it was a national geographic expedition but it was organized by the explorers club
there were three other expeditions on the mountain an american team a new zealand team and an imax team
and after actually two months of preparation we built our camps all the way up the mountain
this is a view looking up the icefall the first feet of the climb up from base camp
and heres a picture in the icefall its a waterfall but its frozen but it moves very slowly and it actually changes every day
when youre in it youre like a rat in a maze you cant even see over the top
this is near the top of the icefall
you want to climb through at night when the ice is frozen
that way its less likely to tumble down on you
these are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at sun up
this is me crossing a crevasse
we cross on aluminum ladders with safety ropes attached
thats another crevasse
some of these things are stories deep or more and one of my climbing friends says that the reason we actually climb at night is because if we ever saw the bottom of what were climbing over we would never do it
okay this is camp one
its the first flat spot you can reach after you get up to the top of the icefall
and from there we climb up to camp two which is sort of the foreground
these are climbers moving up the lhotse face that mountain toward camp three
theyre on fixed ropes here
a fall here if you werent roped in would be feet down
this is a view taken from camp three
you can see the lhotse face is in profile its about a degree angle it takes two days to climb it so you put the camp halfway through
if you notice the summit of everest is black
theres no ice over it
and thats because everest is so high its in the jet stream and winds are constantly scouring the face so no snow gets to accumulate
what looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge is actually snow being blown off the summit
this is on the way up from camp three to camp four moving in up through the clouds
and this is at camp four
once you get to camp four you have maybe hours to decide if youre going to go for the summit or not
everybodys on oxygen your supplies are limited and you either have to go up or go down make that decision very quickly
this is a picture of rob hall
he was the leader of the new zealand team
this is a radio he used later to call his wife that ill tell you about
these are some climbers waiting to go to the summit
theyre up at camp four and you can see that theres wind blowing off the summit
this is not good weather to climb in so the climbers are just waiting hoping that the winds going to die down
and in fact the wind does die down at night
it becomes very calm theres no wind at all
this looks like a good chance to go for the summit
so here are some climbers starting out for the summit on whats called the triangular face
its the first part of climb
its done in the dark because its actually less steep than what comes next and you can gain daylight hours if you do this in the dark
so thats what happened
the climbers got on the southeast ridge
this is the view looking at the southeast ridge
the summit would be in the foreground
from here its about feet up at a degree angle to the summit
but what happened that year was the wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up
a storm blew in that no one was anticipating
you can see here some ferocious winds blowing snow way high off the summit
and there were climbers on that summit ridge
this is a picture of me in that area taken a year before and you can see ive got an oxygen mask on with a rebreather
i have an oxygen hose connected here
you can see on this climber we have two oxygen tanks in the backpack little titanium tanks very lightweight and were not carrying much else
this is all youve got youre very exposed on the summit ridge
ok this is a view taken on the summit ridge itself
this is on the way toward the summit on that foot bridge
all the climbers here are climbing unroped and the reason is because the drop off is so sheer on either side that if you were roped to somebody youd wind up just pulling them off with you
so each person climbs individually
and its not a straight path at all its very difficult climbing and theres always the risk of falling on either side
if you fall to your left youre going to fall feet into nepal if you fall to your right youre going to fall feet into tibet
so its probably better to fall into tibet because youll live longer
but either way you fall for the rest of your life
ok those climbers were up near the summit along that summit ridge that you see up there and i was down here in camp three
my expedition was down in camp three while these guys were up there in the storm
the storm was so fierce that we had to lay fully dressed fully equipped laid out on the tent floor to stop the tent from blowing off the mountain
it was the worst winds ive ever seen
and the climbers up on the ridge were that much higher feet higher and completely exposed to the elements
we were in radio contact with some of them
this is a view taken along the summit ridge
rob hall we heard by radio was up here at this point in the storm with doug hansen
and we heard that rob was ok but doug was too weak to come down
he was exhausted and rob was staying with him
we also got some bad news in the storm that beck weathers another climber had collapsed in the snow and was dead
there were still other climbers that we werent aware of their condition
they were lost there was total confusion on the mountain all the stories were confusing most of them were conflicting
we really had no idea what was going on during that storm
we were just hunkered down in our tents at camp three
our two strongest climbers todd burleson and pete athans decided to go up to try to rescue who they could even though there was a ferocious storm going
they tried to radio a message to rob hall who was a superb climber stuck sort of with a weak climber up near the summit
i expected them to say to rob hold on were coming
but in fact what they said was leave doug and come down yourself
theres no chance of saving him and just try to save yourself at this point
and rob got that message but his answer was were both listening
todd and pete got up to the summit ridge up in here and it was a scene of complete chaos up there
but they did what they could to stabilize the people
i gave them radio advice from camp three and we sent down the climbers that could make it down under their own power
the ones that couldnt we just sort of decided to leave up at camp four
so the climbers were coming down along this route
this is taken from camp three where i was
and they all came by me so i could take a look at them and see what i could do for them which is really not much because camp three is a little notch cut in the ice in the middle of a degree angle
you can barely stand outside the tent
its really cold its feet
the only supplies i had at that altitude were two plastic bags with preloaded syringes of painkiller and steroids
so as the climbers came by me i sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition to continue on further down
the ones that werent that lucid or were not that well coordinated i would give an injection of steroids to try to give them some period of lucidity and coordination where they could then work their way further down the mountain
its so awkward to work up there that sometimes i even gave the injections right through their clothes
it was just too hard to maneuver any other way up there
while i was taking care of them we got more news about rob hall
there was no way we could get up high enough to rescue him
he called in to say that he was alone now
apparently doug had died higher up on the mountain
but rob was now too weak to come down himself and with the fierce winds and up at that altitude he was just beyond rescue and he knew it
at that point he asked to be paged into his wife
he was carrying a radio
his wife was home in new zealand seven months pregnant with their first child and rob asked to be patched into her that was done and rob and his wife had their last conversation
they picked the name for their baby
rob then signed off and that was the last we ever heard of him
i was faced with treating a lot of critically ill patients at feet which was an impossibility
so what we did was we got the victims down to feet where it was easier for me to treat them
this was my medical kit
its a tackle box filled with medical supplies
this is what i carried up the mountain
i had more supplies lower down which i asked to be brought up to meet me at the lower camp
and this was scene at the lower camp
the survivors came in one by one
some of them were hypothermic some of them were frostbitten some were both
what we did was try to warm them up as best we could put oxygen on them and try to revive them which is difficult to do at feet when the tent is freezing
this is some severe frostbite on the feet severe frostbite on the nose
this climber was snow blind
as i was taking care of these climbers we got a startling experience
out of nowhere beck weathers who we had already been told was dead stumbled into the tent just like a mummy he walked into the tent
i expected him to be incoherent but in fact he walked into the tent and said to me hi ken where should i sit
and then he said do you accept my health insurance
he really said that
so he was completely lucid but he was very severely frostbitten
you can see his hand is completely white his face his nose is burned
first it turns white and then when its completed necrosis it turns black and then it falls off
its the last stage just like a scar
so as i was taking care of beck he related what had been going on up there
he said he had gotten lost in the storm collapsed in the snow and just laid there unable to move
some climbers had come by and looked at him and he heard them say hes dead
but beck wasnt dead he heard that but he was completely unable to move
he was in some sort of catatonic state where he could be aware of his surroundings but couldnt even blink to indicate that he was alive
so the climbers passed him by and beck lay there for a day a night and another day in the snow
and then he said to himself i dont want to die
i have a family to come back to
and the thoughts of his family his kids and his wife generated enough energy enough motivation in him so that he actually got up
after laying in the snow that long a time he got up and found his way back to the camp
and beck told me that story very quietly but i was absolutely stunned by it
i couldnt imagine anybody laying in the snow that long a time and then getting up
he apparently reversed an irreversible hypothermia
and i can only try to speculate on how he did it
so what if we had beck hooked up to a spect scan something that could actually measure brain function
just very simply the three parts of the brain the frontal lobe where you focus your attention and concentration you have the temporal lobe where you form images and keep memories and the posterior part of your brain which contains the cerebellum which controls motion and the brain stem where you have your basic maintenance functions like heartbeat and respiration
so lets take a cut through the brain here and imagine that beck was hooked up to a spect scan
this measures dynamic blood flow and therefore energy flow within the brain
so you have the prefrontal cortex here lighting up in red
this is a pretty evenly distributed scan
you have the middle area where the temporal lobe might be in here and the posterior portion where the maintenance functions are in the back
this is a roughly normal scan showing equal distribution of energy
now you go to this one and you see how much more the frontal lobes are lighting up
this might be what beck would be experiencing when he realizes hes in danger
hes focusing all his attention on getting himself out of trouble
these parts of the brain are quieting down
hes not thinking about his family or anybody else at this point and hes working pretty hard
hes trying to get his muscles going and get out of this
ok but hes losing ground here
hes running out of energy
its too cold he cant keep his metabolic fires going and you see theres no more red here his brain is quieting down
hes collapsed in the snow here everything is quiet theres very little red anywhere
beck is powering down
hes dying
you go on to the next scan but in becks case you can see that the middle part of his brain is beginning to light up again
hes beginning to think about his family
hes beginning to have images that are motivating him to get up
hes developing energy in this area through thought
and this is how hes going to turn thought back into action
this part of the brain is called the anterior cingulate gyrus
its an area in which a lot of neuroscientists believe the seat of will exists
this is where people make decisions where they develop willpower
and you can see theres an energy flow going from the mid portion of his brain where hes got images of his family into this area which is powering his will
okay this is getting stronger and stronger to the point where its actually going to be a motivating factor
hes going to develop enough energy in that area after a day a night and a day to actually motivate himself to get up
and you can see here hes starting to get more energy into the frontal lobe
hes beginning to focus he can concentrate now
hes thinking about what hes got to do to save himself
so this energy has been transmitted up toward the front of his brain and its getting quieter down here but hes using this energy to think about what he has to do to get himself going
and then that energy is sort of spreading throughout his thought areas
hes not thinking about his family now and hes getting himself motivated
this is the posterior part where his muscles are going to be moving and hes going to be pacing himself
his heart and lungs are going to pick up speed
so this is what i can speculate might have been going on had we been able to do a spect scan on beck during this survival epic
so here i am taking care of beck at feet and i felt what i was doing was completely trivial compared to what he had done for himself
it just shows you what the power of the mind can do
he was critically ill there were other critically ill patients luckily we were able to get a helicopter in to rescue these guys
a helicopter came in at feet and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history
it was able to land on the ice take away beck and the other survivors one by one and get them off to kathmandu in a clinic before we even got back to base camp
this is a scene at base camp at one of the camps where some of the climbers were lost
and we had a memorial service there a few days later
these are serphas lighting juniper branches
they believe juniper smoke is holy
and the climbers stood around on the high rocks and spoke of the climbers who were lost up near the summit turning to the mountain actually to talk to them directly
there were five climbers lost here
this was scott fischer rob hall andy harris doug hansen and yasuko namba
and one more climber should have died that day but didnt and thats beck weathers
he was able to survive because he was able to generate that incredible willpower he was able to use all the power of his mind to save himself
these are tibetan prayer flags
these sherpas believe that if you write prayers on these flags the message will be carried up to the gods and that year becks message was answered
thank you

title tyrone hayes penelope jagessar chaffer the toxic baby title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript filmmaker penelope jagessar chaffer was curious about the chemicals she was exposed to while pregnant could they affect her unborn child so she asked scientist tyrone hayes to brief her on one he studied closely atrazine a herbicide used on corn onstage together at tedwomen hayes and chaffer tell their story description
penelope jagessar chaffer i was going to ask if theres a doctor in the house
no im just joking
its interesting because it was six years ago when i was pregnant with my first child that i discovered that the most commonly used preservative in baby care products mimics estrogen when it gets into the human body
now its very easy actually to get a chemical compound from products into the human body through the skin
and these preservatives had been found in breast cancer tumors
that was the start of my journey to make this film toxic baby
and it doesnt take much time to discover some really astonishing statistics with this issue
one is that you and i all have between to chemicals in our bodies that our grandparents didnt have
and many of these chemicals are now linked to the skyrocketing incidents of chronic childhood disease that were seeing across industrialized nations
ill show you some statistics
so for example in the united kingdom the incidence of childhood leukemia has risen by percent just in a generation
very similar statistic for childhood cancer in the u s
in canada were now looking at one in canadian children with asthma
thats a four fold increase
again similar story around the world
in the united states probably the most astonishing statistic is a percent increase in autism and autistic spectrum disorders and other learning disabilities
again were seeing that trend across europe across north america
and in europe theres certain parts of europe where were seeing a four fold increase in certain genital birth defects
interestingly one of those birth defects has seen a percent increase in the u s
so a real skyrocketing of chronic childhood disease that includes other things like obesity and juvenile diabetes premature puberty
so its interesting for me when im looking for someone who can really talk to me and talk to an audience about these things that probably one of the most important people in the world who can discuss toxicity in babies is expert in frogs
tyrone hayes it was a surprise to me as well that i would be talking about pesticides that id be talking about public health because in fact i never thought i would do anything useful
frogs
in fact my involvement in the whole pesticide issue was sort of a surprise as well when i was approached by the largest chemical company in the world and they asked me if i would evaluate how atrazine affected amphibians or my frogs
it turns out atrazine is the largest selling product for the largest chemical company in the world
its the number one contaminant of groundwater drinking water rain water
in after my studies it was banned in the european union but in that same year the united states epa re registered the compound
we were a bit surprised when we found out that when we exposed frogs to very low levels of atrazine parts per billion that it produced animals that look like this
these are the dissected gonads of an animal that has two testes two ovaries another large testis more ovaries which is not normal
even for amphibians
in some cases another species like the north american leopard frog showed that males exposed to atrazine grew eggs in their testes
and you can see these large yolked up eggs bursting through the surface of this males testes
now my wife tells me and im sure penelope can as well that theres nothing more painful than childbirth which that ill never experience i cant really argue that but i would guess that a dozen chicken eggs in my testicle would probably be somewhere in the top five
in recent studies that weve published weve shown that some of these animals when theyre exposed to atrazine some of the males grow up and completely become females
so these are actually two brothers consummating a relationship
and not only do these genetic males mate with other males they actually have the capacity to lay eggs even though theyre genetic males
what we proposed and what weve now generated support for is that what atrazine is doing is wreaking havoc causing a hormone imbalance
normally the testes should make testosterone the male hormone
but what atrazine does is it turns on an enzyme the machinery if you will aromatase that converts testosterone into estrogen
and as a result these exposed males lose their testosterone theyre chemically castrated and theyre subsequently feminized because now theyre making the female hormone
now this is what brought me to the human related issues
because it turns out that the number one cancer in women breast cancer is regulated by estrogen and by this enzyme aromatase
so when you develop a cancerous cell in your breast aromatase converts androgens into estrogens and that estrogen turns on or promotes the growth of that cancer so that it turns into a tumor and spreads
in fact this aromatase is so important in breast cancer that the latest treatment for breast cancer is a chemical called letrozole which blocks aromatase blocks estrogen so that if you developed a mutated cell it doesnt grow into a tumor
now whats interesting is of course that were still using million pounds of atrazine the number one contaminant in drinking water that does the opposite turns on aromatase increases estrogen and promotes tumors in rats and is associated with tumors breast cancer in humans
whats interesting is in fact the same company that sold us million pounds of atrazine the breast cancer promoter now sells us the blocker the exact same company
and so i find it interesting that instead of treating this disease by preventing exposure to the chemicals that promote it we simply respond by putting more chemicals into the environment
pjc so speaking of estrogen one of the other compounds that tyrone talks about in the film is something called bisphenol a bpa which has been in the news recently
its a plasticizer
its a compound thats found in polycarbonate plastic which is what baby bottles are made out of
and whats interesting about bpa is that its such a potent estrogen that it was actually once considered for use as a synthetic estrogen in hormone placement therapy
and there have been many many many studies that have shown that bpa leaches from babies bottles into the formula into the milk and therefore into the babies
so were dosing our babies our newborns our infants with a synthetic estrogen
now two weeks ago or so the european union passed a law banning the use of bpa in babies bottles and sippy cups
and for those of you who are not parents sippy cups are those little plastic things that your child graduates to after using bottles
but just two weeks before that the u s senate refused to even debate the banning of bpa in babies bottles and sippy cups
so it really makes you realize the onus on parents to have to look at this and regulate this and police this in their own lives and how astonishing that is
pjc with many plastic baby bottles now proven to leak the chemical bisphenol a it really shows how sometimes it is only a parents awareness that stands between chemicals and our children
the baby bottle scenario proves that we can prevent unnecessary exposure
however if we parents are unaware we are leaving our children to fend for themselves
th and what penelope says here is even more true
for those of you who dont know were in the middle of the sixth mass extinction
scientists agree now
we are losing species from the earth faster than the dinosaurs disappeared and leading that loss are amphibians
percent of all amphibians are threatened and in come decline
and i believe many scientists believe that pesticides are an important part of that decline
in part amphibians are good indicators and more sensitive because they dont have protection from contaminants in the water no eggshells no membranes and no placenta
in fact our invention by our i mean we mammals one of our big inventions was the placenta
but we also start out as aquatic organisms
but it turns out that this ancient structure that separates us from other animals the placenta cannot evolve or adapt fast enough because of the rate that were generating new chemicals that its never seen before
the evidence of that is that studies in rats again with atrazine show that the hormone imbalance atrazine generates causes abortion
because maintaining a pregnancy is dependent on hormones
of those rats that dont abort atrazine causes prostate disease in the pups so the sons are born with an old mans disease
of those that dont abort atrazine causes impaired mammary or breast development in the exposed daughters in utero so that their breast dont develop properly
and as a result when those rats grow up their pups experience retarded growth and development because they cant make enough milk to nourish their pups
so the pup you see on the bottom is affected by atrazine that its grandmother was exposed to
and given the life of many of these chemicals generations years dozens of years that means that we right now are affecting the health of our grandchildrens grandchildren by things that were putting into the environment today
and this is not just philosophical its already known that chemicals like diethylstilbestrol and estrogen pcbs ddt cross the placenta and effectively determine the likelihood of developing breast cancer and obesity and diabetes already when the babys in the womb
in addition to that after the babys born our other unique invention as mammals is that we nourish our offspring after theyre born
we already know that chemicals like ddt and des and atrazine can also pass over into milk again affecting our babies even after their born
pjc so when tyrone tells me that the placenta is an ancient organ im thinking how do i demonstrate that
how do you show that
and its interesting when you make a film like this because youre stuck trying to visualize science that theres no visualization for
and i have to take a little bit of artistic license
old man placenta control
what is it
oh what
puffuffuff what
perflourooctanoic acid
blimey
never heard of it
pjc and neither had i actually before i started making this film
and so when you realize that chemicals can pass the placenta and go into your unborn child it made me start to think what would my fetus say to me
what would our unborn children say to us when they have an exposure thats happening everyday day after day
child today i had some octyphenols some artificial musks and some bisphenol a
help me
pjc its a very profound notion to know that we as women are at the vanguard of this
this is our issue because we collect these compounds our entire life and then we end up dumping it and dumping them into our unborn children
we are in effect polluting our children
and this was something that was really brought home to me a year ago when i found out i was pregnant and the first scan revealed that my baby had a birth defect associated with exposure to estrogenic chemicals in the womb and the second scan revealed no heartbeat
so my childs death my babys death really brought home the resonance of what i was trying to make in this film
and its sometimes a weird place when the communicator becomes part of the story which is not what you originally intend
and so when tyrone talks about the fetus being trapped in a contaminated environment this is my contaminated environment
this is my toxic baby
and thats something thats just profound and sad but astonishing because so many of us dont actually know this
th one of this things thats exciting and appropriate for me to be here at tedwomen is that well i think it was summed up best last night at dinner when someone said turn to the man at your table and tell them when the revolution starts weve got your back the truth is women youve had our back on this issue for a very long time starting with rachel carsons silent spring to theo colborns our stolen future to sandra steingrabers books living downstream and having faith
and perhaps its the connection to our next generation like my wife and my beautiful daughter here about years ago perhaps its that connection that makes women activists in this particular area
but for the men here i want to say its not just women and children that are at risk
and the frogs that are exposed to atrazine the testes are full of holes and spaces because the hormone imbalance instead of allowing sperm to be generated such as in the testis here the testicular tubules end up empty and fertility goes down by as much as percent
its not just my work in amphibians but similar work has been shown in fish in europe holes in the testes and absence of sperm in reptiles in a group from south america and in rats an absence of sperm in the testicular tubules as well
and of course we dont do these experiments in humans but just by coincidence my colleague has shown that men who have low sperm count low semen quality have significantly more atrazine in their urine
these are just men who live in an agricultural community
men who actually work in agriculture have much higher levels of atrazine
and the men who actually apply atrazine have even more atrazine in their urine up to levels that are times what we know to be active are present in the urine of these men
of course most of them percent are mexican mexican american
and its not just atrazine theyre exposed to
theyre exposed to chemicals like chloropicrin which was originally used as a nerve gas
and many of these workers have life expectancies of only
it shouldnt come to any surprise that the things that happen in wildlife are also a warning to us just like rachel carson and others have warned
as evident in this slide from lake nabugabo in uganda the agricultural runoff from this crop which goes into these buckets is the sole source of drinking cooking and bathing water for this village
now if i told the men in this village that the frogs have pour immune function and eggs developing in their testes the connection between environmental health and public health would be clear
you would not drink water that you knew was having this kind of impact on the wildlife that lived in it
the problem is in my village oakland in most of our villages we dont see that connection
we turn on the faucet the water comes out we assume its safe and we assume that we are masters of our environment rather than being part of it
pjc so it doesnt take much to realize that actually this is an environmental issue
and i kept thinking over and over again this question
we know so much about global warming and climate change and yet we have no concept of what ive been calling internal environmentalism
we know what were putting out there we have a sense of those repercussions but we are so ignorant of this sense of what happens when we put things or things are put into our bodies
and its my feeling and its my urging being here to know that as we women move forward as the communicators of this but also as the ones who carry that burden of carrying the children bearing the children we hold most of the buying power in the household is that its going to be us moving forward to carry the work of tyrone and other scientists around the world
and my urging is that when we think about environmental issues that we remember that its not just about melting glaciers and ice caps but its also about our children as well

title abha dawesar life in the digital now title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript one year ago abha dawesar was living in blacked out manhattan post sandy scrounging for power to connect as a novelist she was struck by this metaphor have our lives now become fixated on the drive to digitally connect while we miss out on whats real description
i was in new york during hurricane sandy and this little white dog called maui was staying with me
half the city was dark because of a power cut and i was living on the dark side
now maui was terrified of the dark so i had to carry him up the stairs actually down the stairs first for his walk and then bring him back up
i was also hauling gallons of bottles of water up to the seventh floor every day
and through all of this i had to hold a torch between my teeth
the stores nearby were out of flashlights and batteries and bread
for a shower i walked blocks to a branch of my gym
but these were not the major preoccupations of my day
it was just as critical for me to be the first person in at a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers to juice my multiple devices
i started to prospect under the benches of bakeries and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points
i wasnt the only one
even in the rain people stood between madison and avenue under their umbrellas charging their cell phones from outlets on the street
nature had just reminded us that it was stronger than all our technology and yet here we were obsessed about being wired
i think theres nothing like a crisis to tell you whats really important and whats not and sandy made me realize that our devices and their connectivity matter to us right up there with food and shelter
the self as we once knew it no longer exists and i think that an abstract digital universe has become a part of our identity and i want to talk to you about what i think that means
im a novelist and im interested in the self because the self and fiction have a lot in common
theyre both stories interpretations
you and i can experience things without a story
we might run up the stairs too quickly and we might get breathless
but the larger sense that we have of our lives the slightly more abstract one is indirect
our story of our life is based on direct experience but its embellished
a novel needs scene after scene to build and the story of our life needs an arc as well
it needs months and years
discrete moments from our lives are its chapters
but the story is not about these chapters
its the whole book
its not only about the heartbreak and the happiness the victories and the disappointments but its because how because of these and sometimes more importantly in spite of these we find our place in the world and we change it and we change ourselves
our story therefore needs two dimensions of time a long arc of time that is our lifespan and the timeframe of direct experience that is the moment
now the self that experiences directly can only exist in the moment but the one that narrates needs several moments a whole sequence of them and thats why our full sense of self needs both immersive experience and the flow of time
now the flow of time is embedded in everything in the erosion of a grain of sand in the budding of a little bud into a rose
without it we would have no music
our own emotions and state of mind often encode time regret or nostalgia about the past hope or dread about the future
i think that technology has altered that flow of time
the overall time that we have for our narrative our lifespan has been increasing but the smallest measure the moment has shrunk
it has shrunk because our instruments enable us in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding of the material world and this granular understanding has generated reams of data that our brains can no longer comprehend and for which we need more and more complicated computers
all of this to say that the gap between what we can perceive and what we can measure is only going to widen
science can do things with and in a picosecond but you and i are never going to have the inner experience of a millionth of a millionth of a second
you and i answer only to natures rhythm and flow to the sun the moon and the seasons and this is why we need that long arc of time with the past the present and the future to see things for what they are to separate signal from noise and the self from sensations
we need times arrow to understand cause and effect not just in the material world but in our own intentions and our motivations
what happens when that arrow goes awry
what happens when time warps
so many of us today have the sensation that times arrow is pointing everywhere and nowhere at once
this is because time doesnt flow in the digital world in the same way that it does in the natural one
we all know that the internet has shrunk space as well as time
far away over there is now here
news from india is a stream on my smartphone app whether im in new york or new delhi
and thats not all
your last job your dinner reservations from last year your former friends lie on a flat plain with todays friends because the internet also archives and it warps the past
with no distinction left between the past the present and the future and the here or there we are left with this moment everywhere this moment that ill call the digital now
just how can we prioritize in the landscape of the digital now
this digital now is not the present because its always a few seconds ahead with twitter streams that are already trending and news from other time zones
this isnt the now of a shooting pain in your foot or the second that you bite into a pastry or the three hours that you lose yourself in a great book
this now bears very little physical or psychological reference to our own state
its focus instead is to distract us at every turn on the road
every digital landmark is an invitation to leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else and do something else
are you reading an interview by an author
why not buy his book tweet it share it
like it find other books exactly like his
find other people reading those books
travel can be liberating but when it is incessant we become permanent exiles without repose
choice is freedom but not when its constantly for its own sake
not just is the digital now far from the present but its in direct competition with it and this is because not just am i absent from it but so are you
not just are we absent from it but so is everyone else
and therein lies its greatest convenience and horror
i can order foreign language books in the middle of the night shop for parisian macarons and leave video messages that get picked up later
at all times i can operate at a different rhythm and pace from you while i sustain the illusion that im tapped into you in real time
sandy was a reminder of how such an illusion can shatter
there were those with power and water and those without
there are those who went back to their lives and those who are still displaced after so many months
for some reason technology seems to perpetuate the illusion for those who have it that everyone does and then like an ironic slap in the face it makes it true
for example its said that there are more people in india with access to cell phones than toilets
now if this rift which is already so great in many parts of the world between the lack of infrastructure and the spread of technology isnt somehow bridged there will be ruptures between the digital and the real
for us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our waking moments in it the challenge is to live in two streams of time that are parallel and almost simultaneous
how does one live inside distraction
we might think that those younger than us those who are born into this will adapt more naturally
possibly but i remember my childhood
i remember my grandfather revising the capitals of the world with me
buda and pest were separated by the danube and vienna had a spanish riding school
if i were a child today i could easily learn this information with apps and hyperlinks but it really wouldnt be the same because much later i went to vienna and i went to the spanish riding school and i could feel my grandfather right beside me
night after night he took me up on the terrace on his shoulders and pointed out jupiter and saturn and the great bear to me
and even here when i look at the great bear i get back that feeling of being a child hanging onto his head and trying to balance myself on his shoulder and i can get back that feeling of being a child again
what i had with my grandfather was wrapped so often in information and knowledge and fact but it was about so much more than information or knowledge or fact
time warping technology challenges our deepest core because we are able to archive the past and some of it becomes hard to forget even as the current moment is increasingly unmemorable
we want to clutch and we are left instead clutching at a series of static moments
theyre like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them
by archiving everything we think that we can store it but time is not data
it cannot be stored
you and i know exactly what it means like to be truly present in a moment
it might have happened while we were playing an instrument or looking into the eyes of someone weve known for a very long time
at such moments our selves are complete
the self that lives in the long narrative arc and the self that experiences the moment become one
the present encapsulates the past and a promise for the future
the present joins a flow of time from before and after
i first experienced these feelings with my grandmother
i wanted to learn to skip and she found an old rope and she tucked up her sari and she jumped over it
i wanted to learn to cook and she kept me in the kitchen cutting cubing and chopping for a whole month
my grandmother taught me that things happen in the time they take that time cant be fought and because it will pass and it will move we owe the present moment our full attention
attention is time
one of my yoga instructors once said that love is attention and definitely from my grandmother love and attention were one and the same thing
the digital world cannibalizes time and in doing so i want to suggest that what it threatens is the completeness of ourselves
it threatens the flow of love
but we dont need to let it
we can choose otherwise
weve seen again and again just how creative technology can be and in our lives and in our actions we can choose those solutions and those innovations and those moments that restore the flow of time instead of fragmenting it
we can slow down and we can tune in to the ebb and flow of time
we can choose to take time back
thank you

title yves behar designing objects that tell stories title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript designer yves behar digs up his creative roots to discuss some of the iconic objects hes created then he turns to the witty surprising elegant objects hes working on now including the laptop description
being a child and sort of crawling around the house i remember these turkish carpets and there were these scenes these battle scenes these love scenes
i mean look this animal is trying to fight back this spear from this soldier
and my mom took these pictures actually last week of our carpets and i remember this to this day
there was another object this sort of towering piece of furniture with creatures and gargoyles and nudity pretty scary stuff when youre a little kid
what i remember today from this is that objects tell stories so storytelling has been a really strong influence in my work
and then there was another influence
i was a teenager and at or i guess like all teenagers we want to just do what we love and what we believe in
and so i fused together the two things i loved the most which was skiing and windsurfing
those are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in switzerland
so i created this compilation of the two i took my skis and i took a board and i put a mast foot in there and some foot straps and some metal fins and here i was going really fast on frozen lakes
it was really a death trap i mean it was incredible it worked incredibly well but it was really dangerous
and i realized then i had to go to design school
i mean look at those graphics there
so i went to design school and it was the early when i finished
and i saw something extraordinary happening in silicon valley so i wanted to be there and i saw that the computer was coming into our homes that it had to change in order to be with us in our homes
and so i got myself a job and i was working for a consultancy and we would get in to these meetings and these managers would come in and they would say well what were going to do here is really important you know
and they would give the projects code names you know mostly from star wars actually things like yoda luke
so in anticipation i would be this young designer in the back of the room and i would raise my hand and i would ask questions
i mean in retrospect probably stupid questions but things like whats this caps lock key for
or whats this num lock key for you know that thing
you know do people really use it
do they need it do they want it in their homes
what i realized then is they didnt really want to change the legacy stuff they didnt want to change the insides
they were really looking for us the designers to create the skins to put some pretty stuff outside of the box
and i didnt want to be a colorist
it wasnt what i wanted to do
i didnt want to be a stylist in this way
and then i saw this quote advertising is the price companies pay for being unoriginal
so i had to start on my own so i moved to san francisco and i started a little company fuseproject
and what i wanted to work on is important stuff
and i wanted to really not just work on the skins but i wanted to work on the entire human experience
and so the first projects were sort of humble but they took technology and maybe made it into things that people would use in a new way and maybe finding some new functionality
this is a watch we made for mini cooper the car company right when it launched and its the first watch that has a display that switches from horizontal to vertical
and that allows me to check my timer discretely here without bending my elbow
and other projects which were really about transformation about matching the human need
this is a little piece of furniture for an italian manufacturer and it ships completely flat and then it folds into a coffee table and a stool and whatnot
and something a little bit more experimental this is a light fixture for swarovski and what it does is it changes shape
so it goes from a circle to a round to a square to a figure eight
and just by drawing on a little computer tablet the entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want
and then finally the leaf lamp for herman miller
this is a pretty involved process it took us about four and a half years
but i really was looking for creating a unique experience of light a new experience of light
so we had to design both the light and the light bulb
and thats a unique opportunity i would say in design
and the new experience i was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from a warm sort of glowing kind of mood light all the way to a bright work light
so the light bulb actually does that
it allows the person to switch and to mix these two colorations
and its done in a very simple way one just touches the base of the light and on one side you can mix the brightness and on the other the coloration of the light
so all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them and i think as designers we need to really think about how we can create a different relationship between our work and the world whether its for business or as im going to show on some civic type projects
because i think everybody agrees that as designers we bring value to business value to the users also but i think its the values that we put into these projects that ultimately create the greater value
and the values we bring can be about environmental issues about sustainability about lower power consumption
you know they can be about function and beauty they can be about business strategy
but designers are really the glue that brings these things together
so jawbone is a project that youre familiar with and it has a humanistic technology
it feels your skin it rests on your skin and it knows when it is youre talking
and by knowing when it is youre talking it gets rid of the other noises that it knows about which is the environmental noises
but the other thing that is humanistic about jawbone is that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff and all the nerdy stuff out of it and try to make it as beautiful as we can
i mean think about it the care we take in selecting sunglasses or jewelry or accessories is really important so if it isnt beautiful it really doesnt belong on your face
and this is what were pursuing here
but how we work on jawbone is really unique
i want to point at something here on the left
this is the board this is one of the things that goes inside that makes this technology work
but this is the design process theres somebody changing the board putting tracers on the board changing the location of the ics as the designers on the other side are doing the work
so its not about slapping skins anymore on a technology
its really about designing from the inside out
and then on the other side of the room the designers are making small adjustments sketching drawing by hand putting it in the computer
and its what i call being design driven
you know there is some push and pull but design is really helping define the whole experience from the inside out
and then of course design is never done
and this is the other new way that is unique in how we work is because its never done you have to do all this other stuff
the packaging and the website and you need to continue to really touch the user in many ways
but how do you retain somebody when its never done
and hosain rahman the ceo of aliph jawbone you know really understands that you need a different structure
so in a way the different structure is that were partners its a partnership we can continue to work and dedicate ourselves to this project and then we also share in the rewards
and heres another project another partnership type approach
this is called y water and its this guy from los angeles thomas arndt austrian originally who came to us and all he wanted to do was to create a healthy drink or an organic drink for his kids to replace the high sugar content sodas that hes trying to get them away from
so we worked on this bottle and its completely symmetrical in every dimension
and this allows the bottle to turn into a game
the bottles connect together and you can create different shapes different forms
thank you
and then while we were doing this the shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a y and then we thought well these words why and why not are probably the most important words that kids ask
so we called it y water and so this is another place where it all comes together in the same room the three dimensional design the ideas the branding it all becomes deeply connected
and then the other thing about this project is we bring intellectual property we bring a marketing approach we bring all this stuff but i think at the end of the day what we bring is these values and these values create a soul for the companies we work with
and its especially rewarding when your design work becomes a creative endeavor when others can be creative and do more with it
heres another project which i think really emulates that
this is the one laptop per child the laptop
this picture is incredible
in nigeria people carry their most precious belongings on their heads
this girl is going to school with a laptop on her head
i mean to me it just means so much
but when nicholas negroponte and he has spoken about this project a lot hes the founder of olpc came to us about two and a half years ago there were some clear ideas
he wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology and those are pillars of his life but also pillars of the mission of one laptop per child
but the third pillar that he talked about was design
and at the time i wasnt really working on computers
i didnt really want to from the previous adventure
but what he said was really significant is that design was going to be why the kids were going to love this product how we were going to make it low cost robust
and plus he said he was going to get rid of the caps lock key and the num lock key too
so i was convinced we designed it to be iconic to look different to look like its for a kid but not like a toy
and then the integration of all these great technologies which youve heard about the wi fi antennas that allow the kids to connect the screen which you can read in sunlight the keyboard which is made out of rubber and its protected from the environment
you know all these great technologies really happened because of the passion and the olpc people and the engineers
they fought the suppliers they fought the manufacturers
i mean they fought like animals for this to remain they way it is
and in a way it is that will that makes projects like this one allows the process from not destroying the original idea
and i think this is something really important
so now you get these pictures you get up in the morning and you see the kids in nigeria and you see them in uruguay with their computers and in mongolia
and we went away from obviously the beige
i mean its colorful its fun
in fact you can see each logo is a little bit different
its because we were able to run during the manufacturing process colors for the x and the o which is the name of the computer and by mixing them on the manufacturing floor you get times you get different options there
so the lessons from seeing the kids using them in the developing world are incredible
but this is my nephew anthony in switzerland and he had the laptop for an afternoon and i had to take it back it was hard
and it was a prototype and a month and a half later i come back to switzerland and there he is playing with his own version
like paper paper and cardboard
so im going to finish with one last project and this is a little bit more of adult play
some of you might have heard about the new york city condom
its actually just launched actually launched on valentines day february about days ago
so the department of health in new york came to us and they needed a way to distribute million condoms for free to the citizens of new york
so a pretty big endeavor and we worked on the dispensers
these are the dispensers theres this friendly shape
its a little bit like designing a fire hydrant and it has to be easily serviceable you have to know where it is and what it does
and we also designed the condoms themselves
and i was just in new york at the launch and i went to see all these places where theyre installed this is at a puerto rican little mom and pop store at a bar in christopher street at a pool hall
i mean theyre being installed in homeless clinics everywhere
of course clubs and discos too
and heres the public service announcement for this project
get some
so this is really where design is able to create a conversation
i was in these venues and people were you know really into getting them they were excited
it was breaking the ice it was getting over a stigma and i think thats also what design can do
so i was going to throw some condoms in the room and whatnot but im not sure its the etiquette here
yeah all right all right i have only a few
so i have more you can always ask me for some more later
and if anybody asks why youre carrying a condom you can just say you like the design
so ill finish with just one thought if we all work together on creating value but if we really keep in mind the values of the work that we do i think we can change the work that we do
we can change these values can change the companies we work with and eventually together maybe we can change the world
so thank you

title dave eggers my wish once upon a school title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript accepting his ted prize author dave eggers asks the ted community to personally creatively engage with local public schools with spellbinding eagerness he talks about how his valencia tutoring center inspired others around the world to open description
thank you so much everyone from ted and chris and amy in particular
i cannot believe im here
i have not slept in weeks
neil and i were sitting there comparing how little weve slept in anticipation for this ive never been so nervous and i do this when im nervous i just realized
so im going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization called valencia and then im going to talk about how we all might join in and do similar things
back in about i was living in brooklyn i was trying to finish my first book i was wandering around dazed every day because i wrote from a m to a m
so i would walk around in a daze during the day
i had no mental acuity to speak of during the day but i had flexible hours
in the brooklyn neighborhood that i lived in park slope there are a lot of writers its like a very high per capita ratio of writers to normal people
meanwhile i had grown up around a lot of teachers
my mom was a teacher my sister became a teacher and after college so many of my friends went into teaching
and so i was always hearing them talk about their lives and how inspiring they were and they were really sort of the most hard working and constantly inspiring people i knew
but i knew so many of the things they were up against so many of the struggles they were dealing with
and one of them was that so many of my friends that were teaching in city schools were having trouble with their students keeping up at grade level in their reading and writing in particular
now so many of these students had come from households where english isnt spoken in the home where a lot of them have different special needs learning disabilities and of course theyre working in schools which sometimes and very often are under funded
and so they would talk to me about this and say you know what we really need is just more people more bodies more one on one attention more hours more expertise from people that have skills in english and can work with these students one on one
now i would say well why dont you just work with them one on one
and they would say well we have five classes of to students each
this can lead up to students a day
how can we possibly give each student even one hour a week of one on one attention
youd have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers
and so we started talking about this
and at the same time i thought about this massive group of people i knew writers editors journalists graduate students assistant professors you name it
all these people that had sort of flexible daily hours and an interest in the english word i hope to have an interest in the english language but im not speaking it well right now
im trying that clock has got me
but everyone that i knew had an interest in the primacy of the written word in terms of nurturing a democracy nurturing an enlightened life
and so they had you know their time and their interest but at the same time there wasnt a conduit that i knew of in my community to bring these two communities together
so when i moved back to san francisco we rented this building
and the idea was to put mcsweeneys mcsweeneys quarterly that we published twice or three times a year and a few other magazines we were going to move it into an office for the first time
it used to be in my kitchen in brooklyn
we were going to move it into an office and we were going to actually share space with a tutoring center
so we thought well have all these writers and editors and everybody sort of a writing community coming into the office every day anyway why dont we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school get extra help on their written homework so you have basically no border between these two communities
so the idea was that we would be working on whatever were working on at p m the students flow in and you put down what youre doing or you trade or you work a little bit later or whatever it is
you give those hours in the afternoon to the students in the neighborhood
so we had this place we rented it the landlord was all for it we did this mural thats a chris ware mural that basically explains the entire history of the printed word in mural form it takes a long time to digest and you have to stand in the middle of the road
so we rented this space
and everything was great except the landlord said well the space is zoned for retail you have to come up with something
youve gotta sell something
you cant just have a tutoring center
so we thought ha ha really
and we couldnt think of anything necessarily to sell but we did all the necessary research
it used to be a weight room so there were rubber floors below acoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights
we took all that down and we found beautiful wooden floors whitewashed beams and it had the look while we were renovating this place somebody said you know it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship
and we looked around and somebody else said well you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer
and so this is what we did so it made everybody laugh and we said theres a point to that
lets sell pirate supplies this is the pirate supply store
you see this is sort of a sketch i did on a napkin
a great carpenter built all this stuff and you see we made it look sort of pirate supply like
here you see planks sold by the foot and we have supplies to combat scurvy
we have the peg legs there that are all handmade and fitted to you
up at the top you see the eyepatch display which is the black column there for everyday use for your eyepatch and then you have the pastel and other colors for stepping out at night special occasions bar mitzvahs and whatever
so we opened this place and this is a vat that we fill with treasures that students dig in
this is replacement eyes in case you lose one
these are some signs that we have all over the place practical joking with pirates
while youre reading the sign we pull a rope behind the counter and eight mop heads drop on your head
that was just my one thing i said we had to have something that drops on peoples heads
it became mop heads and this is the fish theater which is just a saltwater tank with three seats and then right behind it we set up this space which was the tutoring center
so right there is the tutoring center and then behind the curtain were the mcsweeneys offices where all of us would be working on the magazine and book editing and things like that
the kids would come in or we thought they would come in i should back up
we set the place up we opened up we spent months and months renovating this place
we had tables chairs computers everything
i went to a dot com auction at a holiday inn in palo alto and i bought with a stroke of a paddle
anyway we bought em we set everything up and then we waited
it was started with about of my friends people that i had known for years that were writers in the neighborhood
and we sat and at p m we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalk and it just said free tutoring for your english related and writing related needs just come in its all free
and we thought oh theyre going to storm the gates theyre gonna love it and they didnt
and so we waited we sat at the tables we waited and waited
and everybody was becoming very discouraged because it was weeks and weeks that we waited really where nobody came in
and then somebody alerted us to the fact that maybe there was a trust gap because we were operating behind a pirate supply store
we never put it together you know
and so then around that time i persuaded a woman named nineveh caligari a longtime san francisco educator she was teaching in mexico city she had all the experience necessary knew everything about education was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood i convinced her to move up from mexico city where she was teaching
she took over as executive director
immediately she made the inroads with the teachers and the parents and the students and everything and so suddenly it was actually full every day
and what we were trying to offer every day was one on one attention
the goal was to have a one to one ratio with every one of these students
you know its been proven that to hours a year with one on one attention a student can get one grade level higher
and so most of these students english is not spoken in the home
they come there many times their parents you cant see it but theres a church pew that i bought in a berkeley auction right there the parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tutored
so that was the basis of it was one on one attention
and we found ourselves full every day with kids
if youre on valencia street within those few blocks at around p m p m you will get run over often by the kids and their big backpacks or whatever actually running to this space which is very strange because its school in a way
but there was something psychological happening there that was just a little bit different
and the other thing was there was no stigma
kids werent going into the center for kids that need more help or something like that it was valencia
first of all it was a pirate supply store which is insane
and then secondly theres a publishing company in the back
and so our interns were actually working at the same tables very often and shoulder to shoulder computer next to computer with the students
and so it became a tutoring center publishing center is what we called it and a writing center
they go in and they might be working with a high school student actually working on a novel because we had very gifted kids too
so theres no stigma
theyre all working next to each other its all a creative endeavor
theyre seeing adults theyre modeling their behavior
these adults theyre working in their field
they can lean over ask a question of one of these adults and it all sort of feeds on each other
theres a lot of cross pollination the only problem especially for the adults working at mcsweeneys who hadnt necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up was that there was just the one bathroom
with like kids a day this is a problem
but you know theres something about the kids finishing their homework in a given day working one on one getting all this attention they go home theyre finished they dont stall
they dont do their homework in front of the tv
theyre allowed to go home at p m enjoy their family enjoy other hobbies get outside play
and that makes a happy family
a bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community
a bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world
so the key to it all is homework
there you have it you know one on one attention
so we started off with about volunteers and then we had about and then a couple hundred
and we now have volunteers on our roster
and we make it incredibly easy to volunteer
the key thing is even if you only have a couple of hours a month those two hours shoulder to shoulder next to one student concentrated attention shining this beam of light on their work on their thoughts and their self expression is going to be absolutely transformative because so many of the students have not had that ever before
so we said even if you have two hours one sunday every six months it doesnt matter thats going to be enough
so thats partly why the tutor corps grew so fast
then we said well what are we going to do with the space during the day because it has to be used before p m
so we started bringing in classes during the day
so every day theres a field trip where they together create a book you can see it being typed up above
this is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing
you just point a camera at a class and it always looks like this
so this is one of the books that they do
notice the title of the book the book that was never checked out titanic
and the first line of that book is once there was a book named cindy that was about the titanic
so meanwhile theres an adult in the back typing this up taking it completely seriously which blows their mind
so then we still had more tutors to use
this is a shot of just some of the tutors during one of the events
the teachers that we work with and everything is different to teachers they tell us what to do
we went in there thinking were ultimately completely malleable youre going to tell us
the neighborhoods going to tell us the parents are going to tell us
the teachers are going to tell us how were most useful
so then they said why dont you come into the schools
because what about the students that wouldnt come to you necessarily who dont have really active parents that are bringing them in or arent close enough so then we started saying well weve got people on our tutor roster
lets just put out the word a teacher will say i need tutors for the next five sundays
were working on our college essays send them in
so we put that out on the wire tutors
whoever can make it signs up they go in about a half an hour before the class
the teacher tells them what to do how to do it what their training is what their project is so far
they work under the teachers guide and its all in one big room
and thats actually the brunt of what we do is people going straight from their workplace straight from home straight into the classroom and working directly with the students
so then were able to work with thousands and thousands of more students
then another school said well what if we just give you a classroom and you can staff it all day
so this is the everett middle school writers room where we decorated it in buccaneer style
its right off the library and there we serve all kids in this middle school
this is their newspaper the straight up news that has an ongoing column from mayor gavin newsom in both languages english and spanish
so then one day isabel allende wrote to us and said hey why dont you assign a book with high school students
i want them to write about how to achieve peace in a violent world
and so we went into thurgood marshall high school which is a school that we had worked with on some other things and we gave that assignment to the students
and we said isabel allende is going to read all your essays at the end
shes going to publish them in a book
shes going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form
its going to be available in all the bookstores in the bay area and throughout the world on amazon and you name it
so these kids worked harder than theyve ever worked on anything in their lives because there was that outside audience there was isabel allende on the other end
i think we had about tutors that worked on this book with them and so this worked out incredibly well
we had a big party at the end
this is a book that you can find anywhere so that led to a series of these
you can see amy tan sponsored the next one i might get somewhere
and this became an ongoing thing more and more books
now were sort of addicted to the book thing
the kids will work harder than theyve ever worked in their life if they know its going to be permanent know its going to be on a shelf know that nobody can diminish what theyve thought and said that weve honored their words honored their thoughts with hundreds of hours of five drafts six drafts all this attention that we give to their thoughts
and once they achieve that level once theyve written at that level they can never go back
its absolutely transformative
and so then theyre all sold in the store this is near the planks
we sell all the student books
where else would you put them right
so we sell em and then something weird had been happening with the stores the store actually even though we started out as just a gag the store actually made money
so it was paying the rent
and maybe this is just a san francisco thing i dont know i dont want to judge
but people would come in and this was before the pirate movies and everything
it was making a lot of money not a lot of money but it was paying the rent paying a full time staff member there
theres the ocean maps you can see on the left
and it became a gateway to the community
people would come in and say what the
what is this i dont want to swear on the web
is that a rule i dont know
they would say what is this
and people would come in and learn more about it
and then right beyond theres usually a little chain there right beyond they would see the kids being tutored
this is a field trip going on and so they would be shopping and they might be more likely to buy some lard or millet for their parrot or you know a hook or hook protector for nighttime all of these things we sell
so the store actually did really well
but it brought in so many people teachers donors volunteers everybody because it was street level it was open to the public
it wasnt a non profit buried you know on the floor of some building downtown it was right in the neighborhood that it was serving and it was open all the time to the public
so it became this sort of weird happy accident
so all the people i used to know in brooklyn they said well why dont we have a place like that here
and a lot of them had been former educators or would be educators so they combined with a lot of local designers local writers and they just took the idea independently and they did their own thing
they didnt want to sell pirate supplies
they didnt think that that was going to work there
so knowing the crime fighting community in new york they opened the brooklyn superhero supply company
this is sam potts great design that did this
and this was to make it look sort of like one of those keysmiths shops that has to have every service theyve ever offered you know all over there
so they opened this place inside its like a costco for superheroes all the supplies in kind of basic form
these are all handmade
these are all sort of repurposed other products or whatever
all the packaging is done by sam potts
so then you have the villain containment unit where kids put their parents you have the office
this is a little vault you have to put your product in there it goes up an electric lift and then the guy behind the counter tells you that you have to recite the vow of heroism which you do if you want to buy anything and it limits really their sales
personally i think its a problem
because they have to do it hand on heart and everything
these are some of the products these are all handmade
this is a secret identity kit
if you want to take on the identity of sharon boone one american female marketing executive from hoboken new jersey its a full dossier on everything you would need to know about sharon boone
so this is the capery where you get fitted for your cape and then you walk up these three steel graded steps and then we turn on three hydraulic fans from every side and then you can see the cape in action
theres nothing worse than you know getting up there and the cape is bunching up or something like that
so then the secret door this is one of the shelves you dont see when you walk in but it slowly opens
you can see it there in the middle next to all the grappling hooks
it opens and then this is the tutoring center in the back
so you can see the full effect
but this is i just want to emphasize locally funded locally built
all the designers all of the builders everybody was local all the time was pro bono
i just came and visited and said yes you guys are doing great or whatever that was it you can see the time in all five boroughs of new york in the back
so this is the space during tutoring hours
its very busy same principles one on one attention complete devotion to the students work and a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility of creativity and ideas
and this switch is flicked in their heads when they walk through those feet of this bizarre store right
so its school but its not school
its clearly not school even though theyre working shoulder to shoulder on tables pencils and papers whatever
this is one of the students khaled hamdan
you can read this quote
addicted to video games and tv couldnt concentrate at home
came in got this concentrated attention
and he couldnt escape it
so soon enough he was writing he would finish his homework early got really addicted to finishing his homework early
its an addictive thing to sort of be done with it and to have it checked and to know hes going to achieve the next thing and be prepared for school the next day
so he got hooked on that and then he started doing other things
hes now been published in five books
he co wrote a mockumentary about failed superheroes called super has beens
he wrote a series on penguin balboa which is a fighting a boxing penguin
and then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to people at symphony space at a benefit for new york so hes there every day
hes evangelical about it he brings his cousins in now
theres four family members that come in every day
so ill go through really quickly
this is l a the echo park time travel mart whenever you are were already then
this is sort of a eleven for time travelers
so you see everything its exactly as a eleven would be
leeches mammoth chunks they even have their own slurpee machine out of order come back yesterday
anyway so im going to jump ahead
these are spaces that are only affiliated with us doing this same thing word st in pittsfield massachusetts ink spot in cincinnati youth speaks san francisco california which inspired us studio st louis in st louis austin bat cave in austin fighting words in dublin ireland started by roddy doyle this will be open in april
now im going to the ted wish is that okay
all right ive got a minute so the ted wish i wish that you you personally and every creative individual and organization you know will find a way to directly engage with a public school in your area and that youll then tell the story of how you got involved so that within a year we have a thousand examples a thousand of transformative partnerships
profound leaps forward
and these can be things that maybe youre already doing
i know that so many people in this room are already doing really interesting things
i know that for a fact so tell us these stories and inspire others on the website
we created a website
im going to switch to we and not i hope we hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in a new era of participation in our public schools
we hope that you will take the lead in partnering your innovative spirit and expertise with that of innovative educators in your community
always let the teachers lead the way
they will tell you how to be useful i hope that youll step in and help out
there are a million ways
you can walk up to your local school and consult with the teachers theyll always tell you how to help
so this is with hot studio in san francisco they did this phenomenal job
this website is already up its already got a bunch of stories a lot of ideas its called once upon a school which is a great title i think
this site will document every story every project that comes out of this conference and around the world so you go to the website you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by and then you add your own projects once you get started
hot studio did a great job in a very tight deadline so visit the site
if you have any questions you can ask this guy whos our director of national programs hell be on the phone
you email him hell answer any question you possibly want
and hell get you inspired and get you going and guide you through the process so that you can affect change
and it can be fun thats the point of this talk it neednt be sterile it neednt be bureaucratically untenable
you can do and use the skills that you have
the schools need you the teachers need you
students and parents need you they need your actual person your physical personhood and your open minds and open ears and boundless compassion sitting next to them listening and nodding and asking questions for hours at a time
some of these kids just dont plain know how good they are how smart and how much they have to say
you can tell them you can shine that light on them one human interaction at a time so we hope youll join us
thank you so much

title paul root wolpe its time to question bio engineering title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript glowing dogs mice that grow human ears bioethicist paul root wolpe describes an astonishing series of recent bio engineering experiments and asks isnt it time to set some ground rules description
today i want to talk about design but not design as we usually think about it
i want to talk about what is happening now in our scientific biotechnological culture where for really the first time in history we have the power to design bodies to design animal bodies to design human bodies
in the history of our planet there have been three great waves of evolution
the first wave of evolution is what we think of as darwinian evolution
so as you all know species lived in particular ecological niches and particular environments and the pressures of those environments selected which changes through random mutation in species were going to be preserved
then human beings stepped out of the darwinian flow of evolutionary history and created the second great wave of evolution which was we changed the environment in which we evolved
we altered our ecological niche by creating civilization
and that has been the second great couple years years flow of our evolution
by changing our environment we put new pressures on our bodies to evolve
whether it was through settling down in agricultural communities all the way through modern medicine we have changed our own evolution
now were entering a third great wave of evolutionary history which has been called many things intentional evolution evolution by design very different than intelligent design whereby we are actually now intentionally designing and altering the physiological forms that inhabit our planet
so i want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that and then at the end talk a little bit about what some of the implications are for us and for our species as well as our cultures because of this change
now we actually have been doing it for a long time
we started selectively breeding animals many many thousands of years ago
and if you think of dogs for example dogs are now intentionally designed creatures
there isnt a dog on this earth thats a natural creature
dogs are the result of selectively breeding traits that we like
but we had to do it the hard way in the old days by choosing offspring that looked a particular way and then breeding them
we dont have to do it that way anymore
this is a beefalo
a beefalo is a buffalo cattle hybrid
and they are now making them and someday perhaps pretty soon you will have beefalo patties in your local supermarket
this is a geep a goat sheep hybrid
the scientists that made this cute little creature ended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards
i think they said it tasted like chicken
this is a cama
a cama is a camel llama hybrid created to try to get the hardiness of a camel with some of the personality traits of a llama
and they are now using these in certain cultures
then theres the liger
this is the largest cat in the world the lion tiger hybrid
its bigger than a tiger
and in the case of the liger there actually have been one or two that have been seen in the wild
but these were created by scientists using both selective breeding and genetic technology
and then finally everybodys favorite the zorse
none of this is photoshopped these are real creatures
and so one of the things weve been doing is using genetic enhancement or genetic manipulation of normal selective breeding pushed a little bit through genetics
and if that were all this was about then it would be an interesting thing
but something much much more powerful is happening now
these are normal mammalian cells genetically engineered with a bioluminescent gene taken out of deep sea jellyfish
we all know that some deep sea creatures glow
well theyve now taken that gene that bioluminescent gene and put it into mammal cells
these are normal cells
and what you see here is these cells glowing in the dark under certain wavelengths of light
once they could do that with cells they could do it with organisms
so they did it with mouse pups kittens
and by the way the reason the kittens here are orange and these are green is because thats a bioluminescent gene from coral while this is from jellyfish
they did it with pigs
they did it with puppies
and in fact they did it with monkeys
and if you can do it with monkeys though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate is actually between monkeys and apes if they can do it in monkeys they can probably figure out how to do it in apes which means they can do it in human beings
in other words it is theoretically possible that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable of creating human beings that glow in the dark
be easier to find us at night
and in fact right now in many states you can go out and you can buy bioluminescent pets
these are zebra fish theyre normally black and silver
these are zebra fish that have been genetically engineered to be yellow green red and they are actually available now in certain states
other states have banned them
nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures
there is no area of the government not the epa or the fda that controls genetically engineered pets
and so some states have decided to allow them some states have decided to ban them
some of you may have read about the fdas consideration right now of genetically engineered salmon
the salmon on top is a genetically engineered chinook salmon using a gene from these salmon and from one other fish that we eat to make it grow much faster using a lot less feed
and right now the fda is trying to make a final decision on whether pretty soon you could be eating this fish itll be sold in the stores
and before you get too worried about it here in the united states the majority of food you buy in the supermarket already has genetically modified components to it
so even as we worry about it we have allowed it to go on in this country much different in europe without any regulation and even without any identification on the package
these are all the first cloned animals of their type
so in the lower right here you have dolly the first cloned sheep now happily stuffed in a museum in edinburgh ralph the rat the first cloned rat cc the cat for cloned cat snuppy the first cloned dog snuppy for seoul national university puppy created in south korea by the very same man that some of you may remember had to end up resigning in disgrace because he claimed he had cloned a human embryo which he had not
he actually was the first person to clone a dog which is a very difficult thing to do because dog genomes are very plastic
this is prometea the first cloned horse
its a haflinger horse cloned in italy a real gold ring of cloning because there are many horses that win important races who are geldings
in other words the equipment to put them out to stud has been removed
but if you can clone that horse you can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race and his identical genetic duplicate can then be put out to stud
these were the first cloned calves the first cloned grey wolves and then finally the first cloned piglets alexis chista carrel janie and dotcom
in addition weve started to use cloning technology to try to save endangered species
this is the use of animals now to create drugs and other things in their bodies that we want to create
so with antithrombin in that goat that goat has been genetically modified so that the molecules of its milk actually include the molecule of antithrombin that gtc genetics wants to create
and then in addition transgenic pigs knockout pigs from the national institute of animal science in south korea are pigs that they are going to use in fact to try to create all kinds of drugs and other industrial types of chemicals that they want the blood and the milk of these animals to produce for them instead of producing them in an industrial way
these are two creatures that were created in order to save endangered species
the guar is an endangered southeast asian ungulate
a somatic cell a body cell was taken from its body gestated in the ovum of a cow and then that cow gave birth to a guar
same thing happened with the mouflon where its an endangered species of sheep
it was gestated in a regular sheep body which actually raises an interesting biological problem
we have two kinds of dna in our bodies
we have our nucleic dna that everybody thinks of as our dna but we also have dna in our mitochondria which are the energy packets of the cell
that dna is passed down through our mothers
so really what you end up having here is not a guar and not a mouflon but a guar with cow mitochondria and therefore cow mitochondrial dna and a mouflon with another species of sheeps mitochondrial dna
these are really hybrids not pure animals
and it raises the question of how were going to define animal species in the age of biotechnology a question that were not really sure yet how to solve
this lovely creature is an asian cockroach
and what theyve done here is theyve put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain and then a transmitter on top and its on a big computer tracking ball
and now using a joystick they can send this creature around the lab and control whether it goes left or right forwards or backwards
theyve created a kind of insect bot or bugbot
it gets worse than that or perhaps better than that
this actually is one of darpas very important darpa is the defense research agency one of their projects
these goliath beetles are wired in their wings
they have a computer chip strapped to their backs and they can fly these creatures around the lab
they can make them go left right they can make them take off
they cant actually make them land
they put them about one inch above the ground and then they shut everything off and they go pfft
but its the closest they can get to a landing
and in fact this technology has gotten so developed that this creature this is a moth this is the moth in its pupa stage and thats when they put the wires in and they put in the computer technology so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth it is already prewired
the wires are already in its body and they can just hook it up to their technology and now theyve got these bugbots that they can send out for surveillance
they can put little cameras on them and perhaps someday deliver other kinds of ordinance to warzones
its not just insects
this is the ratbot or the robo rat by sanjiv talwar at suny downstate
again its got technology its got electrodes going into its left and right hemispheres its got a camera on top of its head
the scientists can make this creature go left right
they have it running through mazes controlling where its going
theyve now created an organic robot
the graduate students in sanjiv talwars lab said is this ethical
weve taken away the autonomy of this animal
ill get back to that in a minute
theres also been work done with monkeys
this is miguel nicolelis of duke
he took owl monkeys wired them up so that a computer watched their brains while they moved especially looking at the movement of their right arm
the computer learned what the monkey brain did to move its arm in various ways
they then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm which you see here in the picture put the arm in another room
pretty soon the computer learned by reading the monkeys brainwaves to make that arm in the other room do whatever the monkeys arm did
then he put a video monitor in the monkeys cage that showed the monkey this prosthetic arm and the monkey got fascinated
the monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm this prosthetic arm would do
and eventually she was moving it and moving it and eventually stopped moving her right arm and staring at the screen could move the prosthetic arm in the other room only with her brainwaves which means that monkey became the first primate in the history of the world to have three independent functional arms
and its not just technology that were putting into animals
this is thomas demarse at the university of florida
he took and then disaggregated rat neurons so these are just individual neurons from rats put them on a chip
they self aggregated into a network became an integrated chip
and he used that as the it piece of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator
so now we have organic computer chips made out of living self aggregating neurons
finally mussa ivaldi of northwestern took a completely intact independent lamprey eel brain
this is a brain from a lamprey eel
it is living fully intact brain in a nutrient medium with these electrodes going off to the sides attached photosensitive sensors to the brain put it into a cart heres the cart the brain is sitting there in the middle and using this brain as the sole processor for this cart when you turn on a light and shine it at the cart the cart moves toward the light when you turn it off it moves away
its photophilic
so now we have a complete living lamprey eel brain
is it thinking lamprey eel thoughts sitting there in its nutrient medium
i dont know but in fact it is a fully living brain that we have managed to keep alive to do our bidding
so we are now at the stage where we are creating creatures for our own purposes
this is a mouse created by charles vacanti of the university of massachusetts
he altered this mouse so that it was genetically engineered to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse and transplanted onto a human being
genetic engineering coupled with polymer physiotechnology coupled with xenotransplantation
this is where we are in this process
finally not that long ago craig venter created the first artificial cell where he took a cell took a dna synthesizer which is a machine created an artificial genome put it in a different cell the genome was not of the cell he put it in and that cell then reproduced as the other cell
in other words that was the first creature in the history of the world that had a computer as its parent it did not have an organic parent
and so asks the economist the first artificial organism and its consequences
so you may have thought that the creation of life was going to happen in something that looked like that
but in fact thats not what frankensteins lab looks like
this is what frankensteins lab looks like
this is a dna synthesizer and here at the bottom are just bottles of a t c and g the four chemicals that make up our dna chain
and so we need to ask ourselves some questions
for the first time in the history of this planet we are able to directly design organisms
we can manipulate the plasmas of life with unprecedented power and it confers on us a responsibility
is everything okay
is it okay to manipulate and create whatever creatures we want
do we have free reign to design animals
do we get to go someday to pets r us and say look i want a dog
id like it to have the head of a dachshund the body of a retriever maybe some pink fur and lets make it glow in the dark
does industry get to create creatures who in their milk in their blood and in their saliva and other bodily fluids create the drugs and industrial molecules we want and then warehouse them as organic manufacturing machines
do we get to create organic robots where we remove the autonomy from these animals and turn them just into our playthings
and then the final step of this once we perfect these technologies in animals and we start using them in human beings what are the ethical guidelines that we will use then
its already happening its not science fiction
we are not only already using these things in animals some of them were already beginning to use on our own bodies
we are now taking control of our own evolution
we are directly designing the future of the species of this planet
it confers upon us an enormous responsibility that is not just the responsibility of the scientists and the ethicists who are thinking about it and writing about it now
it is the responsibility of everybody because it will determine what kind of planet and what kind of bodies we will have in the future

title péter fankhauser meet rezero the dancing ballbot title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript engineering student péter fankhauser demonstrates rezero a robot that balances on a ball designed and built by students rezero is the first ballbot made to move quickly and gracefully and even dance description
let me introduce to you rezero
this little fellow was developed by a group of undergraduate students at the autonomous systems laboratory at eth zurich
our robot belongs to a family of robots called ballbots
instead of wheels a ballbot is balancing and moving on one single ball
the main characteristics of such a system is that theres one sole contact point to the ground
this means that the robot is inherently unstable
its like when i am trying to stand on one foot
you might ask yourself whats the usefulness of a robot thats unstable
now well explain that in a second
let me first explain how rezero actually keeps his balance
rezero keeps his balance by constantly measuring his pitch angle with a sensor
he then counteracts and avoids toppling over by turning the motors appropriately
this happens times per second and if anything fails in this process rezero would immediately fall to the ground
now to move and to balance rezero needs to turn the ball
the ball is driven by three special wheels that allow rezero to move into any direction and also move around his own axis at the same time
due to his instability rezero is always in motion now heres the trick
its indeed exactly this instability that allows a robot to move very
lets play a little
you may have wondered what happens if i give the robot a little push
in this mode hes trying to maintain his position
for the next demo id like you to introduce to my colleagues michael on the computer and thomas whos helping me onstage
in the next mode rezero is passive and we can move him around
with almost no force i can control his position and his velocity
i can also make him spin
in the next mode we can get rezero to follow a person
hes now keeping a constant distance to thomas
this works with a laser sensor thats mounted on top of rezero
with the same method we can also get him to circle a person
we call this the orbiting mode
all right thank you thomas
now whats the use of this technology
for now its an experiment but let me show you some possible future applications
rezero could be used in exhibitions or parks
with a screen it could inform people or show them around in a fun and entertaining way
in a hospital this device could be used to carry around medical equipment
due to the ballbot system it has a very small footprint and its also easy to move around
and of course who wouldnt like to take a ride on one of these
and these are more practical applications
but theres also a certain beauty within this technology
thank you

because the breast has become are very political organ
the truth has become lost in all the rhetoric coming from the press politicians radiologists and medical imaging companies
i will do my best this morning to tell you what i think is the truth
but first my disclosures
i am not a breast cancer survivor
im not a radiologist
i dont have any patents and ive never received any money from a medical imaging company and i am not seeking your vote
what i am is a doctor of internal medicine who became passionately interested in this topic about years ago when a patient asked me a question
she came to see me after discovering a breast lump
her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer in her
she and i were both very pregnant at that time and my heart just ached for her imagining how afraid she must be
fortunately her lump proved to be benign
but she asked me a question how confident was i that i would find a tumor early on her mammogram if she developed one
so i studied her mammogram and i reviewed the radiology literature and i was shocked to discover that in her case our chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogram were less than the toss of a coin
you may recall a year ago when a firestorm erupted after the united states preventive services task force reviewed the worlds mammography screening literature and issued a guideline recommending against screening mammograms in women in their
now everybody rushed to criticize the task force even though most of them werent in anyway familiar with the mammography studies
it took the senate just days to ban the use of the guidelines in determining insurance coverage
radiologists were outraged by the guidelines
the pre eminent mammographer in the united states issued the following quote to the washington post
the radiologists were in turn criticized for protecting their own financial self interest
but in my view the radiologists are heroes
theres a shortage of radiologists qualified to read mammograms and thats because mammograms are one of the most complex of all radiology studies to interpret and because radiologists are sued more often over missed breast cancer than any other cause
but that very fact is telling
where there is this much legal smoke there is likely to be some fire
the factor most responsible for that fire is breast density
breast density refers to the relative amount of fat pictured here in yellow versus connective and epithelial tissues pictured in pink
and that proportion is primarily genetically determined
two thirds of women in their have dense breast tissue which is why mammography doesnt work as well in them
and although breast density generally declines with age up to a third of women retain dense breast tissue for years after menopause
so how do you know if your breasts are dense
well you need to read the details of your mammography report
radiologists classify breast density into four categories based on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram
if the breast is less than percent dense thats called fatty replaced
the next category is scattered fibroglandular densities followed by heterogeneously dense and extremely dense
and breasts that fall into these two categories are considered dense
the problem with breast density is that its truly the wolf in sheeps clothing
both tumors and dense breast tissue appear white on a mammogram and the x ray often cant distinguish between the two
so its easy to see this tumor in the upper part of this fatty breast
but imagine how difficult it would be to find that tumor in this dense breast
thats why mammograms find over percent of tumors in fatty breasts but as few as percent in extremely dense breasts
now its bad enough that breast density makes it hard to find a cancer but it turns out that its also a powerful predictor of your risk for breast cancer
its a stronger risk factor than having a mother or a sister with breast cancer
at the time my patient posed this question to me breast density was an obscure topic in the radiology literature and very few women having mammograms or the physicians ordering them knew about this
but what else could i offer her
mammograms have been around since the and its changed very little
there have been surprisingly few innovations until digital mammography was approved in
digital mammography is still an x ray of the breast but the images can be stored and manipulated digitally just like we can with a digital camera
the u s has invested four billion dollars converting to digital mammography equipment and what have we gained from that investment
in a study funded by over million taxpayer dollars digital mammography was found to be no better over all than traditional mammography and in fact it was worse in older women
but it was better in one group and that was women under who were pre menopausal and had dense breasts and in those women digital mammography found twice as many cancers but it still only found percent
so digital mammography has been a giant leap forward for manufacturers of digital mammography equipment but its been a very small step forward for womankind
what about ultrasound
ultrasound generates more biopsies that are unnecessary relative to other technologies so its not widely used
and mri is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors but its also very expensive
if we think about disruptive technology we see an almost ubiquitous pattern of the technology getting smaller and less expensive
think about ipods compared to stereos
but its the exact opposite in health care
the machines get ever bigger and ever more expensive
screening the average young woman with an mri is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a hummer
its just way too much equipment
one mri scan costs times what a digital mammogram costs
and sooner or later were going to have to accept the fact that health care innovation cant always come at a much higher price
malcolm gladwell wrote an article in the new yorker on innovation and he made the case that scientific discoveries are rarely the product of one individuals genius
rather big ideas can be orchestrated if you can simply gather people with different perspectives in a room and get them to talk about things that they dont ordinarily talk about
its like the essence of ted
he quotes one innovator who says the only time a physician and a physicist get together is when the physicist gets sick
this makes no sense because physicians have all kinds of problems that they dont realize have solutions
and physicists have all kinds of solutions for things that they dont realize are problems
now take a look at this cartoon that accompanied gladwells article and tell me if you see something disturbing about this depiction of innovative thinkers
so if you will allow me a little creative license i will tell you the story of the serendipitous collision of my patients problem with a physicists solution
shortly after her visit i was introduced to a nuclear physicist at mayo named michael oconner who was a specialist in cardiac imaging something i had nothing to do with
and he happened to tell me about a conference hed just returned from in israel where they were talking about a new type of gamma detector
now gamma imaging has been around for a long time to image the heart and it had even been tried to image the breast
but the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge bulky tubes and they were filled with these scintillating crystals and you just couldnt get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors
but the potential advantage was that gamma rays unlike x rays are not influenced by breast density
but this technology could not find tumors when theyre small and finding a small tumor is critical for survival
if you can find a tumor when its less than a centimeter survival exceeds percent but drops off rapidly as tumor size increases
but michael told me about a new type of gamma detector that hed seen and this is it
its made not of a bulky tube but of a thin layer of a semiconductor material that serves as the gamma detector
and i started talking to him about this problem with breast density and we realized that we might be able to get this detector close enough around the breast to actually find small tumors
so after putting together a grid of these cubes with tape michael hacked off the x ray plate of a mammography machine that was about to be thrown out and we attached the new detector and we decided to call this machine molecular breast imaging or mbi
this is an image from our first patient
and you can see using the old gamma technology that it just looked like noise
but using our new detector we could begin to see the outline of a tumor
so here we were a nuclear physicist an internist soon joined by carrie hruska a biomedical engineer and two radiologists and we were trying to take on the entrenched world of mammography with a machine that was held together by duct tape
to say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system
this is our current detector
and you can see that it looks a lot different
the duct tape is gone and we added a second detector on top of the breast which has further improved our tumor detection
so how does this work
the patient receives an injection of a radio tracer thats taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells but not by normal cells and this is the key difference from mammography
mammography relies on differences in the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue and weve seen that those differences can be obscured in a dense breast
but mbi exploits the different molecular behavior of tumors and therefore its impervious to breast density
after the injection the patients breast is placed between the detectors
and if youve ever had a mammogram if youre old enough to have had a mammogram you know what comes next pain
you may be surprised to know that mammography is the only radiologic study thats regulated by federal law and the law requires that the equivalent of a pound car battery come down on your breast during this study
but with mbi we use just light pain free compression
and the detector then transmits the image to the computer
so heres an example
you can see on the right a mammogram showing a faint tumor the edges of which are blurred by the dense tissue
but the mbi image shows that tumor much more clearly as well as a second tumor which profoundly influence that patients surgical options
in this example although the mammogram found one tumor we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors one is small as three millimeters
our big break came in
after we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors we used these images to submit a grant to the susan g komen foundation
and we were elated when they took a chance on a team of completely unknown investigators and funded us to study women with dense breasts comparing a screening mammogram to an mbi
of the tumors that we found mammography found mbi found percent
heres an example from that screening study
the digital mammogram was read as normal and shows lots of dense tissue but the mbi shows an area of intense uptake which correlated with a two centimeter tumor
in this case a one centimeter tumor
and in this case a year old medical secretary at mayo who had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young wanted to enroll in our study
and her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue but her mbi showed an area of worrisome uptake which we can also see on a color image
and this corresponded to a tumor the size of a golf ball
but fortunately it was removed before it had spread to her lymph nodes
so now that we knew that this technology could find three times more tumors in a dense breast we had to solve one very important problem
we had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose and we have spent the last three years making modifications to every aspect of the imaging system to allow this
and im very happy to report that were now using a dose of radiation that is equivalent to the effective dose from one digital mammogram
and at this low dose were continuing this screening study and this image from three weeks ago in a year old woman shows a normal digital mammogram but an mbi image showing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer
so this is not just young women that its benefiting
its also older women with dense tissue
and were now routinely using one fifth the radiation dose thats used in any other type of gamma technology
mbi generates four images per breast
mri generates over a thousand
it takes a radiologist years of specialty training to become expert in differentiating the normal anatomic detail from the worrisome finding
but i suspect even the non radiologists in the room can find the tumor on the mbi image
but this is why mbi is so potentially disruptive its as accurate as mri its far less complex to interpret and its a fraction of the cost
but you can understand why there may be forces in the breast imaging world who prefer the status quo
after achieving what we felt were remarkable results our manuscript was rejected by four journals
after the fourth rejection we requested reconsideration of the manuscript because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology
our manuscript was then accepted and will be published later this month in the journal radiology
we still need to complete the screening study using the low dose and then our findings will need to be replicated at other institutions and this could take five or more years
if this technology is widely adopted i will not benefit financially in any way and that is very important to me because it allows me to continue to tell you the truth
but i recognize i recognize that the adoption of this technology will depend as much on economic and political forces as it will on the soundness of the science
the mbi unit has now been fda approved but its not yet widely available
so until something is available for women with dense breasts there are things that you should know to protect yourself
first know your density
ninety percent of women dont and percent of women dont know that it increases your breast cancer risk
the state of connecticut became the first and only state to mandate that women receive notification of their breast density after a mammogram
i was at a conference of people in breast imaging last week in chicago and i was stunned that there was a heated debate as to whether we should be telling women what their breast density is
of course we should
and if you dont know please ask your doctor or read the details of your mammography report
second if youre pre menopausal try to schedule your mammogram in the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle when breast density is relatively lower
third if you notice a persistent change in your breast insist on additional imaging
and fourth and most important the mammography debate will rage on but i do believe that all women and older should have an annual mammogram
mammography isnt perfect but its the only test thats been proven to reduce mortality from breast cancer
but this mortality banner is the very sword which mammographys most ardent advocates use to deter innovation
some women who develop breast cancer die from it many years later and most women thankfully survive
so it takes or more years for any screening method to demonstrate a reduction in mortality from breast cancer
mammographys the only one thats been around long enough to have a chance of making that claim
it is time for us to accept both the extraordinary successes of mammography and the limitations
we need to individualize screening based on density
for women without dense breasts mammography is the best choice
but for women with dense breasts we shouldnt abandon screening altogether we need to offer them something better
the babies that we were carrying when my patient first asked me this question are now both in middle school and the answer has been so slow to come
shes given me her blessing to share this story with you
after undergoing biopsies that further increased her risk for cancer and losing her sister to cancer she made the difficult decision to have a prophylactic mastectomy
we can and must do better not just in time for her granddaughters and my daughters but in time for you
thank you

dan holzman please throw out the beanbag chairs here we go
barry friedman there are all kinds of high tech chairs here today but this is really i think when it reached its peak as far as ergonomics comfort design flexibility
dh now obviously this is not something we do on our regular show its something we just kind of learned for this so were going to try but can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs
bf nice show daniel nice show you are the man
nice show man that was good
dh thank you
bf you know sometimes when people do those they go all the way down
you actually just did that
thats the kind of extra effort thats gotten us where we are today
dh all right lets show them something special
bf without a macarthur grant
yeah look at this you know all kinds of different
ted is about invention lets be honest right dh yeah it is
bf last night michael moschen showed some juggling props he has invented and working on
right now dans going to show something he actually invented
dh a type of juggling i actually invented right after i saw another juggler do it
bf shut up
dh and this is a small excerpt from a longer piece
folks this is shaker cup juggling its not a showstopper but it certainly slows it down
bf oh yeah it does
bf oh daniel
dh one more
perfect
perfect
bf ok dh oh all right
im now pushing my luck im skipping right to six cups
in order to do six cups i must have perfect control over three with my right hand
bf also three with his left
dh perfect
and now all six cups should i do it on the first try or should i miss once on purpose
bf first try once on purpose
dh how about if i try first and then decide
bf good idea lets leave that well leave that door open
dh hes looking at me
bf thats all right he does that all right
dh oh its time for richards help
oh good all right
bf you know over the years every year at the conference its kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous with richard and weve always done something with the bullwhips in our act its funny for years i did it with daniel holding balloons
and then we thought how stupid
dh excuse me could we work on the design of the microphone
bf i think thats the next session
dh next session
bf yeah and so weve actually found a way to incorporate richard in this
he actually assumes more of the danger in this
dh please stand up richard
dh now richard please
bf ok sorry
dh jesus christ richard please stand in front of me
richard wurman can i say something
bf sure
rw in all past years ive rehearsed with them the things that have happened to me i have no idea whats going to happen and thats the truth
dh all right please stand here in front
god i hate that put your hands out like this please
bf no come stay up with him
dan used to actually hold them but now hes got you for protection
its kind of neat ok

ok here we go
have him hold your wrist so i can
dh please hold my wrist will you bf yeah hold this a minute
there you go
ok
ok hold on
rw hmmm
dh first one
bf all those mid year phone calls are coming back to me now richard
dh so richard what were we on the list like
what happened there
bf i think we were just outside
dh sorry bf having some bad flashbacks
rw do you want me to hold you or not dh dont hold me that hard
bf here we go im taking it
dh one more one more
bf weve got one more were going to do
rw do i get to hold them
bf you dont want to hold these trust me
dh could you spread your legs a little bit
bf gloria you want to do it its very cool
one more try man i dont want to get too close
could you just push that
dh wow boy
bf thats cool i always wanted to try that
dh lets jump this way though
now we risked richards life its only fair we risk our own lives
so to do that i will juggle these three razor sharp sickles
and if that wasnt enough and judging by your response its not
dh wow bf hoping for a little more build
dh true barry
bf im going to run up behind him
dh leap over my shoulder
bf up and over his shoulders
dh grab the blades in mid air land right there in a pool of blood
still juggling
impossible you say
bf incredible you say
dh why bother you say
bf here we go
dh just do it juggler boys you say
bf this guy this guy invented air
dh i think so thats right
even the pencil
bf he invented the pencil
dh all right well do this trick but please remember it took us over years to perfect
bf ten years to perfect which youre about to see
dh its not that difficult we just dont like to practice that much
bf no its a hassle traveling too much
actually we will take a second to prove this could be fake that the blades are indeed razor sharp
dh will someone please throw a small farm animal up onto the stage
or a virgin for a sacrifice
bf anything
dh wheres gloria
bf no shes got farm animal
dh do you have a small farm animal
just trying to play the odds all right here we go
bf over the top over the top
dh how you feeling barry you feeling all right
bf yeah its all right
dh do you feel everythings ok the atmosphere the
bf yeah a little sketchy
dh everything up heres ok
bf yeah
dh then here we go
bf this ones a little whos doing the lights could you point that a little more directly into my eyeballs is that possible i can still see a little
dh and turn up the intensity were still pink in the middle
we went too far
bf yeah its too far its too much of a visual
the design of the body is a whole different thing
dh ready barry bf over the top
dh may we have our jumping music please
may we have it a bit louder
bf theyre a good crew whoa
dh whoa sorry all right
bf were going on
dh all right well try again
bf all right oh my gosh oh

bf one more quick thing
dh the french judge gives it a
bf well you know
dh there you go bf oh yeah another one coming in
dh tell them about our bio and stuff
bf yeah in our bio some of you may have read that weve won two world juggling championships
and believe it or not you dont win juggling champions for doing things with bullwhips or shaker cups
were going to show you right now an excerpt from a routine that we used to wipe out the other juggling team competition
dh thats right
bf good
dh i know what youre thinking other juggling teams must really suck
bf jugglings got a bad rap
dh but wait barry theres still one more club lying there by my foot
and look it has a twin
dh theres still one more by my foot
what do you want me to do with it
bf richard you tell him its your last year
dh thats a pretty good setup richard
bf yeah its a good setup thats a big setup
dh you cant get any better than that all right what i will do i will use my panther like reflexes
bf nice
dh i got that to reach down and grab that club in my grip of steel
bf nice
dh i touched it barry that should be enough
bf its progress thats the thing
dh how about that ill do it again
oh wait its on your side barry
and its awfully windy over there
bf it is its weird you wouldnt think it would affect half the stage but it is its weird
watch this what im going to do is slide the seventh one onto my foot
dh wow what a great trick barry
oh look how it lies there
oh barry is there nothing you cant do
you are my hero youre my jim shea jr
too much olympics
bf from my foot ill attempt to kick the seventh club here we go
dh where barry where tell us barry
eagerly awaits your next syllable what will it be
what gem of knowledge
what pearl of wisdom
do you want to buy a vowel barry
is that your final answer
bf all right you have to turn off the tv from time to time
dh i do i do
bf from my foot the kick up in the seven
dh we will juggle seven
bf from six to seven dh thats a worlds record bf really dh for us

title kevin stone the bio future of joint replacement title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript arthritis and injury grind down millions of joints but few get the best remedy real biological tissue kevin stone shows a treatment that could sidestep the high costs and donor shortfall of human to human transplants with a novel use of animal tissue description
so let me just start with my story
so i tore my knee joint meniscus cartilage playing soccer in college
then i went on to tear my acl the ligament in my knee and then developed an arthritic knee
and im sure that many of you in this audience have that same story and by the way i married a woman who has exactly the same story
so this motivated me to become an orthopedic surgeon and to see if i couldnt focus on solutions for those problems that would keep me playing sports and not limit me
so with that let me just show you a quick video to get you in the mood of what were trying to explain
narrator we are all aware of the risk of cancer but theres another disease thats destined to affect even more of us arthritis
cancer may kill you but when you look at the numbers arthritis ruins more lives
assuming you live a long life theres a percent chance youll develop arthritis
and its not just aging that causes arthritis
common injuries can lead to decades of pain until our joints quite literally grind to a halt
desperate for a solution weve turned to engineering to design artificial components to replace our worn out body parts but in the midst of the modern buzz around the promises of a bionic body shouldnt we stop and ask if theres a better more natural way
lets consider an alternative path
what if all the replacements our bodies need already exist in nature or within our own stem cells
this is the field of biologic replacements where we replace worn out parts with new natural ones
kevin stone and so the mission is how do i treat these things biologically
and lets talk about both what i did for my wife and what ive done for hundreds of other patients
first thing for my wife and the most common thing i hear from my patients particularly in the to year old age group year old age group is they come in and say hey doc isnt there just a shock absorber you can put in my knee
im not ready for joint replacement
and so for her i put in a human meniscus allograft donor right into that joint space
and replaces
and then for that unstable ligament we put in a human donor ligament to stabilize the knee
and then for the damaged arthritis on the surface we did a stem cell paste graft which we designed in to regrow that articular cartilage surface and give it back a smooth surface there
so heres my wifes bad knee on the left and her just hiking now four months later in aspen and doing well
and it works not just for my wife but certainly for other patients
the girl on the video jen hudak just won the superpipe in aspen just nine months after having destroyed her knee as you see in the other image and having a paste graft to that knee
and so we can regrow these surfaces biologically
so with all this success why isnt that good enough you might ask
well the reason is because theres not enough donor cycles
theres not enough young healthy people falling off their motorcycle and donating that tissue to us
and the tissues very expensive
and so thats not going to be a solution thats going to get us global with biologic tissue
but the solution is animal tissue because its plentiful its cheap you can get it from young healthy tissues but the barrier is immunology
and the specific barrier is a specific epitope called the galactosyl or gal epitope
so if were going to transplant animal tissues to people we have to figure out a way to get rid of that epitope
so my story in working with animal tissues starts in
and i started first with cow achilles tendon where we would take the cow achilles tendon which is type i collagen strip it of its antigens by degrading it with an acid and detergent wash and forming it into a regeneration template
we would then take that regeneration template and insert it into the missing meniscus cartilage to regrow that in a patients knee
weve now done that procedure and its been done worldwide in over cases so its an fda approved and worldwide accepted way to regrow the meniscus
and thats great when i can degrade the tissue
but what happens for your ligament when i need an intact ligament
i cant grind it up in a blender
so in that case i have to design and we designed with uri galili and tom turek an enzyme wash to wash away or strip those galactosyl epitopes with a specific enzyme
and we call that a gal stripping technique
what we do is humanize the tissue
its by gal stripping that tissue we humanize it and then we can put it back into a patients knee
and weve done that now weve taken pig ligament young healthy big tissue put it into patients in an fda approved trial and then one of our patients went on to have three canadian masters downhill championships on his pig lig as he calls it so we know it can work
and theres a wide clinical trial of this tissue now pending
so what about the next step
what about getting to a total biologic knee replacement not just the parts
how are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement
well heres how were going to do it
so what were going to do is take an articular cartilage from a young healthy pig strip it of its antigens load it with your stem cells then put it back on to that arthritic surface in your knee tack it on there have you heal that surface and then create a new biologic surface for your knee
so thats our biologic approach right now
were going to rebuild your knee with the parts
were going to resurface it with a completely new surface
but we have other advantages from the animal kingdom
theres a benefit of million years of ambulation
we can harness those benefits
we can use thicker younger better tissues than you might have injured in your knee or that you might have when youre or
we can do it as an outpatient procedure
we can strip that tissue very economically and so this is how we can get biologic knee replacement to go global
and so welcome to super biologics
its not hardware
its not software
its bioware
its version of you
and so with that coming to a coming to an operating theater near you soon i believe
thank you very much

title marcel dicke why not eat insects title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript marcel dicke makes an appetizing case for adding insects to everyones diet his message to squeamish chefs and foodies delicacies like locusts and caterpillars compete with meat in flavor nutrition and eco friendliness description
okay im going to show you again something about our diets
and i would like to know what the audience is and so who of you ever ate insects
thats quite a lot
but still youre not representing the overall population of the earth
because theres percent out there that really eats insects
but this is quite good
why not eat insects well first what are insects
insects are animals that walk around on six legs
and here you see just a selection
theres six million species of insects on this planet six million species
theres a few hundreds of mammals six million species of insects
in fact if we count all the individual organisms we would come at much larger numbers
in fact of all animals on earth of all animal species percent walks on six legs
but if we would count all the individuals and we take an average weight of them it would amount to something like to kilograms for each of you and me on earth
that means that in terms of biomass insects are more abundant than we are and were not on a planet of men but were on a planet of insects
insects are not only there in nature but they also are involved in our economy usually without us knowing
there was an estimation a conservative estimation a couple of years ago that the u s economy benefited by billion dollars per year
its a number very large a contribution to the economy of the united states for free
and so i looked up what the economy was paying for the war in iraq in the same year
it was billion u s dollars
well we know that that was not a cheap war
so insects just for free contribute to the economy of the united states with about the same order of magnitude just for free without everyone knowing
and not only in the states but in any country in any economy
what do they do
they remove dung they pollinate our crops
a third of all the fruits that we eat are all a result of insects taking care of the reproduction of plants
they control pests and theyre food for animals
theyre at the start of food chains
small animals eat insects
even larger animals eat insects
but the small animals that eat insects are being eaten by larger animals still larger animals
and at the end of the food chain we are eating them as well
theres quite a lot of people that are eating insects
and here you see me in a small provincial town in china lijiang about two million inhabitants
if you go out for dinner like in a fish restaurant where you can select which fish you want to eat you can select which insects you would like to eat
and they prepare it in a wonderful way
and here you see me enjoying a meal with caterpillars locusts bee pupae delicacies
and you can eat something new everyday
theres more than species of insects that are being eaten all around the globe
thats quite a bit more than just a few mammals that were eating like a cow or a pig or a sheep
more than species an enormous variety
and now you may think okay in this provincial town in china theyre doing that but not us
well weve seen already that quite some of you already ate insects maybe occasionally but i can tell you that every one of you is eating insects without any exception
youre eating at least grams per year
what are you eating
tomato soup peanut butter chocolate noodles any processed food that youre eating contains insects because insects are here all around us and when theyre out there in nature theyre also in our crops
some fruits get some insect damage
those are the fruits if theyre tomato that go to the tomato soup
if they dont have any damage they go to the grocery
and thats your view of a tomato
but theres tomatoes that end up in a soup and as long as they meet the requirements of the food agency there can be all kinds of things in there no problem
in fact why would we put these balls in the soup theres meat in there anyway
in fact all our processed foods contain more proteins than we would be aware of
so anything is a good protein source already
now you may say okay so were eating grams just by accident
were even doing this on purpose
in a lot of food items that we have i have only two items here on the slide pink cookies or surimi sticks or if you like campari a lot of our food products that are of a red color are dyed with a natural dye
the surimi sticks crabmeat or is being sold as crab meat is white fish thats being dyed with cochineal
cochineal is a product of an insect that lives off these cacti
its being produced in large amounts to metric tons per year in the canary islands in peru and its big business
one gram of cochineal costs about euros
one gram of gold is euros
so its a very precious thing that were using to dye our foods
now the situation in the world is going to change for you and me for everyone on this earth
the human population is growing very rapidly and is growing exponentially
where at the moment we have something between six and seven billion people it will grow to about nine billion in
that means that we have a lot more mouths to feed and this is something that worries more and more people
there was an fao conference last october that was completely devoted to this
how are we going to feed this world
and if you look at the figures up there it says that we have a third more mouths to feed but we need an agricultural production increase of percent
and thats especially because this world population is increasing and its increasing not only in numbers but were also getting wealthier and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more and also starts to eat more meat
and meat in fact is something that costs a lot of our agricultural production
our diet consists some part of animal proteins and at the moment most of us here get it from livestock from fish from game
and we eat quite a lot of it
in the developed world its on average kilograms per person per year which goes up to in the united states and a bit lower in some other countries but on average kilograms per person per year
in the developing world its much lower
its kilograms per person per year
but its increasing enormously
in china in the last years it increased from to and its still increasing
so if a third of the world population is going to increase its meat consumption from to on average and a third of the world population is living in china and in india were having an enormous demand on meat
and of course we are not there to say thats only for us its not for them
they have the same share that we have
now to start with i should say that we are eating way too much meat in the western world
we could do with much much less and i know ive been a vegetarian for a long time and you can easily do without anything
youll get proteins in any kind of food anyway
but then theres a lot of problems that come with meat production and were being faced with that more and more often
the first problem that were facing is human health
pigs are quite like us
theyre even models in medicine and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human
that means that pigs also share diseases with us
and a pig disease a pig virus and a human virus can both proliferate and because of their kind of reproduction they can combine and produce a new virus
this has happened in the netherlands in the during the classical swine fever outbreak
you get a new disease that can be deadly
we eat insects theyre so distantly related from us that this doesnt happen
so thats one point for insects
and theres the conversion factor
you take kilograms of feed you can get one kilogram of beef but you can get nine kilograms of locust meat
so if you would be an entrepreneur what would you do
with kilograms of input you can get either one or nine kg of output
so far were taking the one or up to five kilograms of output
were not taking the bonus yet
were not taking the nine kilograms of output yet
so thats two points for insects
and theres the environment
if we take kilograms of food and it results in one kilogram of beef the other nine kilograms are waste and a lot of that is manure
if you produce insects you have less manure per kilogram of meat that you produce
so less waste
furthermore per kilogram of manure you have much much less ammonia and fewer greenhouse gases when you have insect manure than when you have cow manure
so you have less waste and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign as it is with cow dung
so thats three points for insects
now theres a big if of course and it is if insects produce meat that is of good quality
well there have been all kinds of analyses and in terms of protein or fat or vitamins its very good
in fact its comparable to anything we eat as meat at the moment
and even in terms of calories it is very good
one kilogram of grasshoppers has the same amount of calories as hot dogs or six big macs
so thats four points for insects
i can go on and i could make many more points for insects but time doesnt allow this
so the question is why not eat insects
i gave you at least four arguments in favor
well have to
even if you dont like it youll have to get used to this because at the moment percent of all our agricultural land is being used to produce livestock
thats not only the land where the livestock is walking and feeding but its also other areas where the feed is being produced and being transported
we can increase it a bit at the expense of rainforests but theres a limitation very soon
and if you remember that we need to increase agricultural production by percent were not going to make it that way
we could much better change from meat from beef to insects
and then percent of the world already eats insects so we are just a minority in a country like the u k the usa the netherlands anywhere
on the left hand side you see a market in laos where they have abundantly present all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night
on the right hand side you see a grasshopper
so people there are eating them not because theyre hungry but because they think its a delicacy
its just very good food
you can vary enormously
it has many benefits
in fact we have delicacy thats very much like this grasshopper shrimps a delicacy being sold at a high price
who wouldnt like to eat a shrimp
there are a few people who dont like shrimp but shrimp or crabs or crayfish are very closely related
they are delicacies
in fact a locust is a shrimp of the land and it would make very good into our diet
so why are we not eating insects yet
well thats just a matter of mindset
were not used to it and we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us
thats why were changing the perception of insects
and im working very hard with my colleague arnold van huis in telling people what insects are what magnificent things they are what magnificent jobs they do in nature
and in fact without insects we would not be here in this room because if the insects die out we will soon die out as well
if we die out the insects will continue very happily
so we have to get used to the idea of eating insects
and some might think well theyre not yet available
well they are
there are entrepreneurs in the netherlands that produce them and one of them is here in the audience marian peeters whos in the picture
i predict that later this year youll get them in the supermarkets not visible but as animal protein in the food
and maybe by youll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that youre going to eat
and theyre being made in the most wonderful ways
a dutch chocolate maker
so theres even a lot of design to it
well in the netherlands we have an innovative minister of agriculture and she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry
and when she got all the ministers of agriculture of the e u
over to the hague recently she went to a high class restaurant and they ate insects all together
its not something that is a hobby of mine
its really taken off the ground
so why not eat insects
you should try it yourself
a couple of years ago we had people all together in a square in wageningen town and they ate insects at the same moment and this was still big big news
i think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects because its just a normal way of doing
so you can try it yourself today and i would say enjoy
and im going to show to bruno some first tries and he can have the first bite
bruno giussani look at them first look at them first
marcel dicke its all protein
bg thats exactly the same you saw in the video actually
and it looks delicious
they just make it nuts or something
md thank you

title lawrence lessig re examining the remix title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript former young republican larry lessig talks about what democrats can learn about copyright from their opposite party considered more conservative a surprising lens on remix culture description
i want to talk about what we learn from conservatives
and im at a stage in life where im yearning for my old days so i want to confess to you that when i was a kid indeed i was a conservative
i was a young republican a teenage republican a leader in the teenage republicans
indeed i was the youngest member of any delegation in the convention that elected ronald reagan to be the republican nominee for president
now i know what youre thinking
youre thinking thats not what the internets say
youre thinking wikipedia doesnt say this fact
and indeed this is just one of the examples of the junk that flows across the tubes in these internets here
wikipedia reports that this guy this former congressman from erie pennsylvania was at the age of one of the youngest people at the republican national convention but its just not true
indeed it drives me so nuts let me just change this little fact here
all right okay so perfect
perfect
okay speaker lawrence lessig right
okay
finally truth will be brought here
okay see its done its almost done here we go
youngest republican okay were finished
thats it please save this
great here we go
and wikipedia is fixed finally
okay but no this is really besides the point
but the thing i want you to think about when we think about conservatives not so much this issue of the convention the thing to think about is this they go to church
now you know i mean a lot of people go to church
im not talking about that only conservatives go to church
and im not talking about the god thing
i dont want to get into that you know thats not my point
they go to church by which i mean they do lots of things for free for each other
they hold potluck dinners
indeed they sell books about potluck dinners
they serve food to poor people
they share they give they give away for free
and its the very same people leading wall street firms who on sundays show up and share
and not only food right
these very same people are strong believers in lots of contexts in the limits on the markets
they are in many important places against markets
indeed they like all of us celebrate this kind of relationship
but theyre very keen that we dont let money drop into that relationship else it turns into something like this
they want to regulate us those conservatives to stop us from allowing the market to spread in those places
because they understand there are places for the market and places where the market should not exist where we should be free to enjoy the fellowship of others
they recognize both of these things have to live together
and the second great thing about conservatives they get ecology
right it was the first great republican president of the century who taught us about environmental thinking teddy roosevelt
they first taught us about ecology in the context of natural resources
and then they began to teach us in the context of innovation economics
they understand in that context free they understand free is an important essential part of the cultural ecology as well
thats the thing i want you to think about them
now i know you dont believe me really here
so heres exhibit number one
i want to share with you my latest hero julian sanchez a libertarian who works at the for many people evil cato institute
okay so julian made this video
hes a terrible producer of videos but its great content so im going to give you a little bit of it
so here he is beginning
julian sanchez im going to make an observation about the way remix culture seems to be evolving
larry lessig so what he does is he begins to tell us about these three videos
this is this fantastic brat pack remix set to lisztomania
which of course spread virally
hugely successful
and then some people from brooklyn saw it
they decided they wanted to do the same
and then of course people from san fransisco saw it
and san franciscans thought they had to do the same as well
and so theyre beautiful but this libertarian has some important lessons he wants us to learn from this
heres lesson number one
js theres obviously also something really deeply great about this
they are acting in the sense that theyre emulating the original mashup
and the guy who shot it obviously has a strong eye and some experience with video editing
but this is also basically just a group of friends having an authentic social moment and screwing around together
it should feel familiar and kind of resonate for anyone whos had a sing a long or a dance party with a group of good friends
ll or
js so thats importantly different from the earlier videos we looked at because here remix isnt just about an individual doing something alone in his basement it becomes an act of social creativity
and its not just that it yields a different kind of product at the end its that potentially it changes the way that we relate to each other
all of our normal social interactions become a kind of invitation to this sort of collective expression
its our real social lives themselves that are transmuted into art
ll and so then what this libertarian draws from these two points
js one remix is about individuals using our shared culture as a kind of language to communicate something to an audience
stage two social remix is really about using it to mediate peoples relationships to each other
first within each video the brat pack characters are used as a kind of template for performing the social reality of each group
but theres also a dialogue between the videos where once the basic structure is established it becomes a kind of platform for articulating the similarities and differences between the groups social and physical worlds
ll and then heres for me the critical key to what julian has to say
js copyright policy isnt just about how to incentivize the production of a certain kind of artistic commodity its about what level of control were going to permit to be exercised over our social realities social realities that are now inevitably permeated by pop culture
i think its important that we keep these two different kinds of public goods in mind
if were only focused on how to maximize the supply of one i think we risk suppressing this different and richer and in some ways maybe even more important one
ll right bingo point
freedom needs this opportunity to both have the commercial success of the great commercial works and the opportunity to build this different kind of culture
and for that to happen you need ideas like fair use to be central and protected to enable this kind of innovation as this libertarian tells us between these two creative cultures a commercial and a sharing culture
the point is they he here gets that culture
now my concern is we dems too often not so much
all right take for example this great company
in the good old days when this republican ran that company their greatest work was work that built on the past right
all of the great disney works were works that took works that were in the public domain and remixed them or waited until they entered the public domain to remix them to celebrate this add on remix creativity
indeed mickey mouse himself of course as steamboat willie is a remix of the then very dominant very popular steamboat bill by buster keaton
this man was a remixer extraordinaire
he is the celebration and ideal of exactly this kind of creativity
but then the company passes through this dark stage to this democrat
wildly different
this is the mastermind behind the eventual passage of what we call the sonny bono copyright term extension act extending the term of existing copyrights by years so that no one could do to disney what disney did to the brothers grimm
now when we tried to challenge this going to the supreme court getting the supreme court the bunch of conservatives there if we could get them to wake up to this to strike it down we had the assistance of nobel prize winners including this right wing nobel prize winner milton friedman who said he would join our brief only if the word no brainer was in the brief somewhere
but apparently no brains existed in this place when democrats passed and signed this bill into law
now tiny little quibble of a footnote sonny bono you might say was a republican but i dont buy it
this guy is no republican
okay for a second example think about this cultural hero icon on the left creator of this character
look at the site that he built star wars mashups inviting people to come and use their creative energy to produce a new generation of attention towards this extraordinarily important cultural icon
read the license
the license for these remixers assigns all of the rights to the remix back to lucas
the mashup is owned by lucas
indeed anything you add to the mashup music you might add lucas has a worldwide perpetual right to exploit that for free
there is no creator here to be recognized
the creator doesnt have any rights
the creator is a sharecropper in this story
and we should remember who employed the sharecroppers the democrats right
so the point is the republicans here recognize that theres a certain need of ownership a respect for ownership the respect we should give the creator the remixer the owner the property owner the copyright owner of this extraordinarily powerful stuff and not a generation of sharecroppers
now i think there are lessons we should learn here lessons about openness
our lives are sharing activities at least in part
even for the head of goldman sachs at least in part
and for that sharing activity to happen we have to have well protected spaces of fair use
thats number one number two this ecology of sharing needs freedom within which to create
freedom which means without permission from anyone the ability to create
and number three we need to respect the creator the creator of these remixes through rights that are directly tied to them
now this explains the right wing nonprofit creative commons
actually its not a right wing nonprofit but of course let me just tie it here the creative commons which is offering authors this simple way to mark their content with the freedoms they intended to carry
so that we go from a all rights reserved world to a some rights reserved world so that people can know the freedoms they have attached to the content building and creating on the basis of this creative copyrighted work
these tools that we built enable this sharing in parts through licenses that make it clear and a freedom to create without requiring permission first because the permission has already been granted and a respect for the creator because it builds upon a copyright the creator has licensed freely
and it explains the vast right wing conspiracy thats obviously developed around these licenses as now more than million digital objects are out there licensed freely in this way
now that picture of an ecology of creativity the picture of an ecology of balanced creativity is that the ecology of creativity we have right now
well as you all know not many of us believe we do
i tripped on the reality of this ecology of creativity just last week
i created a video which was based on a wireside chat that id given and i uploaded it to youtube
i then got this email from youtube weirdly notifying me that there was content in that owned by the mysterious wmg that matched their content id
so i didnt think much about it
and then on twitter somebody said to me your talk on youtube was dmcad was that your purpose
imagining that i had this deep conspiracy to reveal the obvious flaws in the dmca
i answered no i didnt even think about it
but then i went to the site and all of the audio in my site had been silenced
my whole minute video had been silenced because there were snippets in that video a video about fair use that included warner music group music
now interestingly they still sold ads for that music if you played the silent video
you could still buy the music but you couldnt hear anything because it had been silenced
so i did what the current regime says i must do to be free to use youtube to talk about fair use
i went to this site and i had to answer these questions
and then in an extraordinarily bart simpson like juvenile way youve actually got to type out these words and get them right to reassert your freedom to speak
and i felt like i was in third grade again
i will not put tacks on the teachers chair
i will not put tacks on the teachers chair
this is absurd
it is outrageous
it is an extraordinary perversion of the system of freedom we should be encouraging
and the question i ask you is whos fighting it
well interestingly in the last presidential election who was the number one active opponent of this system of regulation in online speech
john mccain
letter after letter attacking youtubes refusal to be more respectful of fair use with their extraordinary notice and take down system that led his campaign so many times to be thrown off the internet
now that was the story of me then my good old days of right wing lunacy
let me come back to now now when im a little leftist im certainly left handed so at least a lefty and i wonder can we on the left expect to build this ecology of freedom now in a world where we know the extraordinarily powerful influences against it where even icons of the left like this entertain and push bills that would effectively ban the requirement of open access for government funded research
the president who has supported a process that secretly negotiates agreements which effectively lock us into the insane system of dmca that we have adopted and likely lock us down a path of three strikes youre out that of course the rest of the world are increasingly adopting
not a single example of reform has been produced yet
and were not going to see this change in this system anytime soon
so heres the lessons of openness that i think we need to learn
openness is a commitment to a certain set of values
we need to speak of those values
the value of freedom its a value of community
its a value of the limits in regulation
its a value respecting the creator
now if we can learn those values from at least some influences on the right if we can take them and incorporate them maybe we could do a little trade
we learn those values on the left and maybe theyll do health care or global warming legislation or something in the right
anyway please join me in teaching these values
thank you very much

title chris bangle great cars are great art title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript american designer chris bangle explains his philosophy that car design is an art form in its own right with an entertaining and ultimately moving account of the bmw groups deep blue project intended to create the suv of the future description
what i want to talk about is as background is the idea that cars are art
this is actually quite meaningful to me because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole we dont do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it and cars are thought so much as a product that its a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art
and so cars as art brings it into an emotional plane if you accept that that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital a
now at this point youre going to see a picture of michelangelo
this is completely different than automobiles
automobiles are self moving things right elevators are automobiles
and theyre not very emotional they solve a purpose and certainly automobiles have been around for years and have made our lives functionally a lot better in many ways theyve also been a real pain in the ass because automobiles are really the thing we have to solve
we have to solve the pollution we have to solve the congestion but thats not what interests me in this speech
what interests me in this speech is cars automobiles may be what you use but cars are what we are in many ways
and as long as we can solve the problems of automobiles and i believe we can with fuel cells or hydrogen like bmw is really hip on and lots of other things then i think we can look past that and try and understand why this hook is in many of us of this car y ness and what that means what we can learn from it
thats what i want to get to cars are not a suit of clothes cars are an avatar cars are an expansion of yourself they take your thoughts your ideas your emotions and they multiply it your anger whatever its an avatar
its a super waldo that you happen to be inside of and if you feel sexy the car is sexy and if youre full of road rage youve got a chevy like a rock right
cars are a sculpture did you know this
that every car you see out there is sculpted by hand
many people think well its computers and its done by machines and stuff like that
well they reproduce it but the originals are all done by hand
its done by men and women who believe a lot in their craft
and they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car that you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum
that tension between the need to express the need to discover then you put something new into it and at the same time you have bounds of craftsmanship
rules that say this is how you handle surfaces this is what control is all about this is how you show youre a master of your craft
and that tension that discovery that push for something new and at the same time that sense of obligation to the regards of craftsmanship thats as strong in cars as it is in anything
we work in clay which hasnt changed much since michelangelo started screwing around with it and theres a very interesting analogy to that too
real quickly michelangelo once said hes there to discover the figure within ok
there we go the automobile
that was years right there did you catch that
between that one there and that one there it changed a lot didnt it
ok its not marketing theres a very interesting car concept here but the marketing part is not what i want to talk about here
i want to talk about this
why it means you have to wash a car what is it that sensuality you have to touch about it thats the sculpture that goes into it that sensuality
and its done by men and women working just like this making cars
now this little quote about sculpture from henry moore i believe that that pressure within that moores talking about at least when it comes to cars comes right back to this idea of the mean
its that will to live that need to survive to express itself that comes in a car and takes over people like me
and we tell other people do this do this do this until this thing comes alive
we are completely infected and beauty can be the result of this infectiousness its quite wonderful
this sculpture is of course at the heart of all of it and its really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars
and its not a whole lot different really when theyre working like this or when somebody works like this
its that same kind of commitment that same kind of beauty
now now i get to the point i want to talk about cars as art
art in the platonic sense is truth its beauty and love
now this is really where designers in car business diverge from the engineers
we dont really have a problem talking about love
we dont have a problem talking about truth or beauty in that sense
thats what were searching for when were working our craft we are really trying to find that truth out there
were not trying to find vanity and beauty
were trying to find the beauty in the truth
however engineers tend to look at things a little bit more newtonian instead of this quantum approach
were dealing with irrationalisms and were dealing with paradoxes that we admit exist and the engineers tend to look things a little bit more like two and two is four and if you get its better and is even better
and that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence in why were doing what were doing
weve pretty much accepted the fact though that we are the women in the organization at bmw bmw is a very manly type business men men men its engineers
and were kind of the female side to that thats ok thats cool you go off and be manly were going to be a little bit more female
because what were interested in is finding form thats more than just a function
were interested in finding beauty thats more than just an aesthetic its really a truth
and i think this idea of soul as being at the heart of great cars is very applicable you all know it you know a car when youve seen it with soul you know how strong this is
well this experience of love and the experience of design to me are interchangeable and now im coming to my story
i discovered something about love and design through a project called deep blue
and first of all you have to go with me for a second and say you know you could take the word love out of a lot of things in our society put the word design in and it still works like this quote here you know it kind of works you know
you can understand that it works in truisms
all is fair in design and war
certainly we live in a competitive society
i think this one here theres a pop song that really describes philippe starck for me you know this is like you know this is like puppy love you know this is cool right
toothbrush cool
it really only gets serious when you look at something like this ok
this is one substitution that i believe all of us in design management are guilty of
and this idea that there is more to love more to design when it gets down to your neighbor your other it can be physical like this and maybe in the future it will be
but right now its in dealing with our own people our own teams who are doing the creating so to my story
the idea of people work is what we work with here and i have to make a bond with my designers when were creating bmws
we have to have a shared intimacy a shared vision that means we have to work as one family we have to understand ourselves that way
theres good times theres interesting times and theres some stress times too
you want to do cars youve got to go outside
youve got to do cars in the rain youve got to do cars in the snow
thats by the way is a presentation we made to our board of directors
we haul their butts out in the snow too you want to know cars outside
well youve got to stand outside to do this
and because these are artists they have very artistic temperaments
all right now one thing about art is art is discovery and art is discovering yourself through your art right
and one thing about cars is were all a little bit like pygmalion we are completely in love with our own creations
this is one of my favorite paintings it really describes our relationship with cars
this is sick beyond belief
but because of this the intimacy with which we work together as a team takes on a new dimension a new meaning
we have a shared center we have a shared focus that car stays at the middle of all our relationships
and its my job in the competitive process to narrow this down
i heard today about josephs death genes that have to go in and kill cell reproduction
you know thats what i have to do sometimes
we start out with cars we narrow it down to five cars down to three cars down to two cars down to one car and im in the middle of that killing basically
someones love someones baby
this is very difficult and you have to have a bond with your team that permits you to do this because their life is wrapped up in that too
theyve got that gene infected in them as well and they want that to live more than anything else
well this project deep blue put me in contact with my team in a way that i never expected and i want to pass it on to you because i want you to reflect on this perhaps in your own relationships
we wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap of faith for bmw
we wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way wed done it that i only had a phone number that connected me to them
so what we did was instead of having a staff of artists that are just your wrist we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers to find out whats the successor to the suv phenomenon in america
this is we did this project and so we sent them off with this team name deep blue now many people know deep blue from ibm we actually stole it from them because we figured if anybody read our faxes theyd think were talking about computers
it turned out it was quite clever because deep blue in a company like bmw has a hook deep blue wow cool name
so people get wrapped up in it and we took a team of designers and we sent them off to america and we gave them a budget what we thought was a set of deliverables a timetable and nothing else
like i said i just had a phone number that connected me to them
and a group of engineers worked in germany and the idea was they would work separately on this problem of whats the successor to the suv
they would come together compare notes then they would work apart come together and they would produce together a monumental set of diverse opinions that didnt pollute each others ideas but at the same time came together and resolved the problems
hopefully really understand the customer at its heart where the customer is live with them in america so sent the team off and actually something different happened they went other places
they disappeared quite honestly and all i got was postcards
now i got some postcards of these guys in las vegas and i got some postcards of these guys in the grand canyon and i got these postcards of niagara falls and pretty soon theyre in new york and i dont know where else
and im telling myself this is going to be a great car theyre doing research that ive never even thought about before
right and they decided that instead of like having a studio and six or seven apartments it was cheaper to rent elizabeth taylors ex house in malibu
and at least they told me it was her house i guess it was at one time she had a party there or something
but anyway this was the house and they all lived there
now this is living half a dozen people whod left their some had left their wives behind and families behind and they literally lived in this house for the entire six months the project was in america but the first three months were the most intensive
and one of the young women in the project she was a fantastic lady she actually built her room in the bathroom
the bathroom was so big she built the bed over the bathtub its quite fascinating
on the other hand i didnt know anything about this ok
nothing this is all going on and all im getting is postcards of these guys in las vegas or whatever saying dont worry chris this is really going to be good ok
so my concept of what a design studio was probably i wasnt up to speed on where these guys were
however the engineers back in munich had taken on this kind of newtonian solution and they were trying to find how many cup holders can dance on the head of a pin and you know these really serious questions that are confronting the modern consumer
and one was hoping that these two teams would get together and this collusion of incredible creativity under these incredible surroundings and these incredibly stressed out engineers would create some incredible solutions
well what i didnt know was and what we found out was these guys they cant even like talk to each other under those conditions
you get a divergence of newtonian and quantum thinking at that point you have a split in your dialog that is so deep and so far that they cannot bring this together at all
and so we had our first meeting after three months in tiburon which is just up the road from here you know tiburon
and the idea was after the first three months of this independent research they would present it all to dr goschel who is now my boss and at that time he was co mentor on the project and they would present their results
we would see where we were going we would see the first indication of what could be the successive phenomenon to the suv in america
and so i had these ideas in my head that this is going to be great
i mean im going to see so much work its so intense i know probably las vegas meant a lot about it and im not really sure where the grand canyon came in either but somehow all this is going to come together and im going to see some really great product
so we went to tiburon after three months and the team had gotten together the week before many days ahead of time
the engineers flew over and designers got together with them and they put their presentation together
well it turns out that the engineers hadnt done anything
and they hadnt done anything because kind of like in car business engineers are there to solve problems and we were asking them to create a problem
and the engineers were waiting for the designers to say this is the problem that weve created now help us solve it
and they couldnt talk about it so what happened was the engineers showed up with nothing
and the engineers told the designers if you go in with all your stuff well walk out well walk right out of the project
so i didnt know any of this and we got a presentation that had an agenda looked like this
there was a whole lot of dialog
we spent four hours being told all about vocabulary that needs to be built between engineers and designers
and here im expecting at any moment ok theyre going to turn the page and im going to see the cars im going to see the sketches im going to see maybe some idea of where its going
dialog kept on going with mental maps of words and pretty soon it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance i was seriously being baffled with bullshit
and if you can imagine what this is like to have these months of postcard indication of how great this team is working and theyre out there spending all this money and theyre learning and theyre doing all this stuff
i went fucking ballistic right i went nuts
you can probably remember tiburon it used to look like this
after four hours of this i stood up and i took this team apart
i screamed at them i yelled at them what the hell are you doing
youre letting me down youre my designers youre supposed to be the creative ones what the hell is going on around here
it was probably one of my better tirades i have some good ones but this was probably one of my better ones and i went into these people how could they take bmws money how could they have a holiday for three months and produce nothing nothing
because of course they didnt tell us that they had three station wagons full of drawings model concepts pictures everything i wanted theyd locked up in the cars because they had shown solidarity with the engineers and theyd decided not to show me anything in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start because they hadnt realized of course that they couldnt do problem creating
so we went to lunch and ive got to tell you this was one seriously quiet lunch
the engineers all sat at one end of the table the designers and i sat at the other end of the table really quiet
and i was just fucking furious furious ok
probably because they had all the fun and i didnt you know
thats what you get furious about right
and somebody asked me about catherine my wife you know did she fly out with me or something
i said no and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife
and i recalled that when catherine and i were married the priest gave a very nice sermon and he said something very important
he said love is not selfish he said love does not mean counting how many times i say i love you it doesnt mean you had sex this many times this month and its two times less than last month so that means you dont love me as much
love is not selfish and i thought about this and i thought you know im not showing love here im seriously not showing love
im in the air im in the air without trust
this cannot be this cannot be that im expecting a certain number of sketches and to me thats my quantification method for qualifying a team
this cannot be
so i told them this story i said guys im thinking about something here this isnt right i cant have a relationship with you guys based on a premise that is a quantifiable one
based on a dictate premise that says im a boss you do what i say without trust i said this cant be
actually we all broke down into tears to be quite honest about it because they still could not tell me how much frustration they had built up inside of them not being able to show me what i wanted and merely having to ask me to trust them that it would come
and i think we felt much closer that day we cut a lot of strings that didnt need to be there and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about
we put the car back at the center of our thoughts and we put love i think truly back into the center of the process
by the way that team went on to create six different concepts for the next model of what would be the proposal for the next generation after suvs in america
one of those was the idea of a crossover coupes you see it downstairs the x coupe they had a lot of fun with that
it was the rendition of our motorcycle the gs as carl magnusson says brute iful as the idea of what could be a motorcycle if you add two more wheels
and so in conclusion my lesson that i wanted to pass on to you was this one here im also going to steal a little quote out of little prince
theres a lot to be said about trust and love if you know that those two words are synonymous for design
i had a very very meaningful relationship with my team that day and its stayed that way ever since
and i hope that you too find that theres more to design and more towards the art of the design than doing it yourself
its true that the trust and the love that makes it worthwhile
thanks so much

title cameron sinclair the refugees of boom and bust title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript at tedglobal u cameron sinclair shows the unreported cost of real estate megaprojects gone bust thousands of migrant construction laborers left stranded and penniless to his fellow architects he says there is only one ethical response description
a few years ago my eyes were opened to the dark side of the construction industry
in young qatari students took me to go and see the migrant worker camps
and since then ive followed the unfolding issue of worker rights
in the last six months more than skyscrapers in the uae have been put on hold or canceled
behind the headlines that lay behind these buildings is the fate of the often indentured construction worker
million of them
mainly indian pakistani sri lankan and nepalese these laborers risk everything to make money for their families back home
they pay a middle man thousands of dollars to be there
and when they arrive they find themselves in labor camps with no water no air conditioning and their passports taken away
while its easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities percent of these people are hired by the private sector and so therefore were equally if not more accountable
groups like buildsafe uae have emerged but the numbers are simply overwhelming
in august uae public officials noted that percent of the countrys labor camps had violated minimum health and fire safety regulations
and last summer more than workers protested for the non payment of wages for the poor quality of food and inadequate housing
and then the financial collapse happened
when the contractors have gone bust as theyve been overleveraged like everyone else the difference is everything goes missing documentation passports and tickets home for these workers
currently right now thousands of workers are abandoned
there is no way back home
and there is no way and no proof of arrival
these are the boom and bust refugees
the question is as a building professional as an architect an engineer as a developer if you know this is going on as we go to the sights every single week are you complacent or complicit in the human rights violations
so lets forget your environmental footprint
lets think about your ethical footprint
what good is it to build a zero carbon energy efficient complex when the labor producing this architectural gem is unethical at best
now recently ive been told ive been taking the high road
but quite frankly on this issue there is no other road
so lets not forget who is really paying the price of this financial collapse
and that as we worry about our next job in the office the next design that we can get to keep our workers
lets not forget these men who are truly dying to work
thank you

title tyler dewitt hey science teachers make it fun title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript high school science teacher tyler dewitt was ecstatic about a lesson plan on bacteria and devastated when his students hated it the problem was the textbook it was impossible to understand he delivers a rousing call for science teachers to ditch the jargon and extreme precision and instead make science sing through stories and demonstrations description
let me tell you a story
its my first year as a new high school science teacher and im so eager
im so excited im pouring myself into my lesson plans
but im slowly coming to this horrifying realization that my students just might not be learning anything
this happens one day id just assigned my class to read this textbook chapter about my favorite subject in all of biology viruses and how they attack
and so im so excited to discuss this with them and i come in and i say can somebody please explain the main ideas and why this is so cool
theres silence
finally my favorite student she looks me straight in the eye and she says the reading sucked
and then she clarified she said you know what i dont mean that it sucks it means that i didnt understand a word of it
its boring um who cares and it sucks
these sympathetic smiles spread all throughout the room now and i realize that all of my other students are in the same boat that maybe they took notes or they memorized definitions from the textbook but not one of them really understood the main ideas
not one of them can tell me why this stuff is so cool why its so important
im totally clueless
i have no idea what to do next
so the only thing i can think of is say listen let me tell you a story
the main characters in the story are bacteria and viruses
these guys are blown up a couple million times
the real bacteria and viruses are so small we cant see them without a microscope and you guys might know bacteria and viruses because they both make us sick
but what a lot of people dont know is that viruses can also make bacteria sick
now the story that i start telling my kids it starts out like a horror story
once upon a time theres this happy little bacterium
dont get too attached to him
maybe hes floating around in your stomach or in some spoiled food somewhere and all of a sudden he starts to not feel so good
maybe he ate something bad for lunch and then things get really horrible as his skin rips apart and he sees a virus coming out from his insides
and then it gets horrible when he bursts open and an army of viruses floods out from his insides
if ouch is right if you see this and youre a bacterium this is like your worst nightmare
but if youre a virus and you see this you cross those little legs of yours and you think we rock
because it took a lot of crafty work to infect this bacterium
heres what had to happen
a virus grabbed onto a bacterium and it slipped its dna into it
the next thing is that virus dna made stuff that chopped up the bacteria dna
and now that weve gotten rid of the bacteria dna the virus dna takes control of the cell and it tells it to start making more viruses
because you see dna is like a blueprint that tells living things what to make
so this is kind of like going into a car factory and replacing the blueprints with blueprints for killer robots
the workers still come the next day they do their job but theyre following different instructions
so replacing the bacteria dna with virus dna turns the bacteria into a factory for making viruses that is until its so filled with viruses that it bursts
but thats not the only way that viruses infect bacteria
some are much more crafty
when a secret agent virus infects a bacterium they do a little espionage
here this cloaked secret agent virus is slipping his dna into the bacterial cell but heres the kicker it doesnt do anything harmful not at first
instead it silently slips into the bacterias own dna and it just stays there like a terrorist sleeper cell waiting for instructions
and whats interesting about this is now whenever this bacteria has babies the babies also have the virus dna in them
so now we have a whole extended bacteria family filled with virus sleeper cells
theyre just happily living together until a signal happens and bam all of the dna pops out
it takes control of these cells turns them into virus making factories and they all burst a huge extended bacteria family all dying with viruses spilling out of their guts the viruses taking over the bacterium
so now you understand how viruses can attack cells
there are two ways on the left is what we call the lytic way where the viruses go right in and take over the cells
on the is the lysogenic way that uses secret agent viruses
so this stuff is not that hard right
and now all of you understand it
but if youve graduated from high school i can almost guarantee youve seen this information before
but i bet it was presented in a way that it didnt exactly stick in your mind
so when my students were first learning this why did they hate it so much
well there were a couple of reasons
first of all i can guarantee you that their textbooks didnt have secret agent viruses and they didnt have horror stories
you know in the communication of science there is this obsession with seriousness
it kills me im not kidding
i used to work for an educational publisher and as a writer i was always told never to use stories or fun engaging language because then my work might not be viewed as serious and scientific
right i mean because god forbid somebody have fun when theyre learning science
so we have this field of science thats all about slime and color changes check this out
and then we have of course as any good scientist has to have explosions
but if a textbook seems too much fun its somehow unscientific
now another problem was that the language in their textbook was truly incomprehensible
if we want to summarize that story that i told you earlier we could start by saying something like these viruses make copies of themselves by slipping their dna into a bacterium
the way this showed up in the textbook it looked like this bacteriophage replication is initiated through the introduction of viral nucleic acid into a bacterium
thats great perfect for year olds
but heres the thing there are plenty of people in science education who would look at this and say theres no way that we could ever give that to students because it contains some language that isnt completely accurate
for example i told you that viruses have dna
well a very tiny fraction of them dont
they have something called rna instead
so a professional science writer would circle that and say that has to go
we have to change it to something much more technical
and after a team of professional science editors went over this really simple explanation theyd find fault with almost every word ive used and theyd have to change anything that wasnt serious enough and theyd have to change everything that wasnt percent perfect
then it would be accurate but it would be completely impossible to understand
this is horrifying
you know i keep talking about this idea of telling a story and its like science communication has taken on this idea of what i call the tyranny of precision where you cant just tell a story
its like science has become that horrible storyteller that we all know who gives us all the details nobody cares about where youre like oh i met my friend for lunch the other day and she was wearing these ugly jeans
i mean they werent really jeans they were more kind of like leggings but like i guess theyre actually kind of more like jeggings like but i think and youre just like oh my god
what is the point
or even worse science education is becoming like that guy who always says actually
right you want to be like oh dude we had to get up in the middle of the night and drive a hundred miles in total darkness
and that guys like actually it was miles
and youre like actually shut up
im just trying to tell a story
because good storytelling is all about emotional connection
we have to convince our audience that what were talking about matters
but just as important is knowing which details we should leave out so that the main point still comes across
im reminded of what the architect mies van der rohe said and i paraphrase when he said that sometimes you have to lie in order to tell the truth
i think this sentiment is particularly relevant to science education
now finally i am often so disappointed when people think that im advocating a dumbing down of science
thats not true at all
im currently a ph d student at mit and i absolutely understand the importance of detailed specific scientific communication between experts but not when were trying to teach year olds
if a young learner thinks that all viruses have dna thats not going to ruin their chances of success in science
but if a young learner cant understand anything in science and learns to hate it because it all sounds like this that will ruin their chances of success
this needs to stop and i wish that the change could come from the institutions at the top that are perpetuating these problems and i beg them i beseech them to just stop it
but i think thats unlikely
so we are so lucky that we have resources like the internet where we can circumvent these institutions from the bottom up
theres a growing number of online resources that are dedicated to just explaining science in simple understandable ways
i dream of a wikipedia like website that would explain any scientific concept you can think of in simple language any middle schooler can understand
and i myself spend most of my free time making these science videos that i put on youtube
i explain chemical equilibrium using analogies to awkward middle school dances and i talk about fuel cells with stories about boys and girls at a summer camp
the feedback that i get is sometimes misspelled and its often written in lolcats but nonetheless its so appreciative so thankful that i know this is the right way we should be communicating science
theres still so much work left to be done though and if youre involved with science in any way i urge you to join me
pick up a camera start to write a blog whatever but leave out the seriousness leave out the jargon
make me laugh make me care
leave out those annoying details that nobody cares about and just get to the point
how should you start
why dont you say listen let me tell you a story
thank you

title kevin surace eco friendly drywall title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript kevin surace suggests we rethink basic construction materials such as the familiar wallboard to reduce the huge carbon footprint generated by the manufacturing and construction of our buildings he introduces ecorock a clean recyclable and energy efficient drywall created by his team at serious materials description
whats happening to the climate
it is unbelievably bad
this is obviously that famous view now of the arctic which is likely to be gone at this point in the next three or four or five years very very very scary
so we all look at what we can do
and when you look at the worldwide sources of percent are tied to buildings
only nine percent is passenger cars interestingly enough
so we ran off to a sushi bar
and at that sushi bar we came up with a great idea
and it was something called ecorock
and we said we could redesign the year old gypsum drywall process that generates billion pounds of a year
so it was a big idea we wanted to reduce that by percent which is exactly what weve done
we started r amp d in
decided to use recycled content from cement and steel manufacturing
there is the inside of our lab we havent shown this before
but our people had to do some different mixes to get this right to hit our targets
and they worked absolutely very very very hard
so then we went forward and built our production line in china
we dont build this production equipment any longer in the u s unfortunately
we did the line install over the summer
we started right there with absolutely nothing
youre seeing for the first time a brand new drywall production line not made using gypsum at all
thats the finished production line there
we got our first panel out on december third
that is the slurry being poured onto paper basically thats the line running
the exciting thing is look at the faces of the people
these are people who worked this project for two to three years
and they are so excited thats the first board off the line
our vice president of operation kissing the board obviously very very excited
but this has a huge huge impact on the environment
we signed the first panel just a few weeks after that had a great signing ceremony leading to people hopefully using these products across the world
and weve got cradle to cradle gold on this thing
we happened to win just recently the green product of the year for the re invention of drywall from popular science
thank you thank you
so here is what we learned gallons of gas equivalent to build one house
you probably had no idea its like driving around the world six times
we must change everything
look around the room chairs wood everything around us has to change or were not going to lick this problem
dont listen to the people who say you cant do this because anyone can
and these job losses we can fix them with green collar jobs
weve got four plants were building this stuff around the country
were going as fast as we can
two and a half million cars worth of gypsum you know generated right
so what will you do ill tell you what i did and why i did it and i know my times up
those are my kids natalie and david
when they have their kids theyd better look back at grandpa and say hey you gave it a good shot you did the best you could with the team that you had
so my hope is that when you leave ted you will look at reducing your carbon footprint in however you can do it
and if you dont know how please find me i will help you
last but not least bill gates i know you invented windows
wait till you see maybe next year what kind of windows weve invented
thank you so much

title shigeru ban emergency shelters made from paper title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript long before sustainability was a buzzword pritzker prize winning architect shigeru ban had begun his experiments with ecologically sound building materials such as cardboard tubes his remarkable structures are often intended as temporary housing for disaster struck nations such as haiti rwanda japan yet often the buildings remain a beloved part of the landscape long after they have served their intended purpose description
hi i am an architect
i am the only architect in the world making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube and this exhibition is the first one i did using paper tubes
much much longer before people started talking about ecological issues and environmental issues i just started testing the paper tube in order to use this as a building structure
its very complicated to test the new material for the building but this is much stronger than i expected and also its very easy to waterproof and also because its industrial material its also possible to fireproof
then i built the temporary structure
this is the first temporary building made out of paper
there are tubes diameter there are only tubes with a diameter of centimeters or four feet wide
as you see it in the photo inside is the toilet
in case youre finished with toilet paper you can tear off the inside of the wall
so its very useful
year there was a big expo in germany
i was asked to design the building because the theme of the expo was environmental issues
so i was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes recyclable paper
my goal of the design is not when its completed
my goal was when the building was demolished because each country makes a lot of pavilions but after half a year we create a lot of industrial waste so my building has to be reused or recycled
after the building was recycled
so that was the goal of my design
then i was very lucky to win the competition to build the second pompidou center in france in the city of metz
because i was so poor i wanted to rent an office in paris but i couldnt afford it so i decided to bring my students to paris to build our office on top of the pompidou center in paris by ourselves
so we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints to complete the meter long office
we stayed there for six years without paying any rent
thank you i had one big problem
because we were part of the exhibition even if my friend wanted to see me they had to buy a ticket to see me
that was the problem
then i completed the pompidou center in metz
its a very popular museum now and i created a big monument for the government
but then i was very disappointed at my profession as an architect because we are not helping we are not working for society but we are working for privileged people rich people government developers
they have money and power
those are invisible
so they hire us to visualize their power and money by making monumental architecture
that is our profession even historically its the same even now we are doing the same
so i was very disappointed that we are not working for society even though there are so many people who lost their houses by natural disasters
but i must say they are no longer natural disasters
for example earthquakes never kill people but collapse of the buildings kill people
thats the responsibility of architects
then people need some temporary housing but there are no architects working there because we are too busy working for privileged people
so i thought even as architects we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing
we can make it better
so that is why i started working in disaster areas
there was a big disaster in rwanda africa
two tribes hutu and tutsi fought each other
over two million people became refugees
but i was so surprised to see the shelter refugee camp organized by the u n
theyre so poor and they are freezing with blankets during the rainy season in the shelters built by the u n they were just providing a plastic sheet and the refugees had to cut the trees and just like this
but over two million people cut trees
it just became big heavy deforestation and an environmental problem
that is why they started providing aluminum pipes aluminum barracks
very expensive they throw them out for money then cutting trees again
so i proposed my idea to improve the situation using these recycled paper tubes because this is so cheap and also so strong but my budget is only u s dollars per unit
we built units to do that as a monitoring test for the durability and moisture and termites so on
and then year afterward in kobe japan we had a big earthquake
nearly people were killed and the city like this nagata district all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake
and also i found out theres many vietnamese refugees suffering and gathering at a catholic church all the building was totally destroyed
so i went there and also i proposed to the priests why dont we rebuild the church out of paper tubes
and he said oh god are you crazy
after a fire what are you proposing
so he never trusted me but i didnt give up
i started commuting to kobe and i met the society of vietnamese people
they were living like this with very poor plastic sheets in the park
so i proposed to rebuild i raised did fundraising
i made a paper tube shelter for them and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demolish i used beer crates as a foundation
i asked the kirin beer company to propose because at that time the asahi beer company made their plastic beer crates red which doesnt go with the color of the paper tubes
the color coordination is very important
and also i still remember we were expecting to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate but it came empty
so i remember it was so disappointing
so during the summer with my students we built over units of the shelters
finally the priest finally he trusted me to rebuild
he said as long as you collect money by yourself bring your students to build you can do it
so we spent five weeks rebuilding the church
it was meant to stay there for three years but actually it stayed there years because people loved it
then in taiwan they had a big earthquake and we proposed to donate this church so we dismantled them we sent them over to be built by volunteer people
it stayed there in taiwan as a permanent church even now
so this building became a permanent building
then i wonder what is a permanent and what is a temporary building
even a building made in paper can be permanent as long as people love it
even a concrete building can be very temporary if that is made to make money
in in turkey the big earthquake i went there to use the local material to build a shelter
in west india i built also a shelter
in in sri lanka after the sumatra earthquake and tsunami i rebuilt islamic fishermens villages
and in in chengdu sichuan area in china nearly people were killed and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor
i was asked to rebuild the temporary church
i brought my japanese students to work with the chinese students
in one month we completed nine classrooms over square meters
its still used even after the current earthquake in china
in in italy laquila also they had a big earthquake
and this is a very interesting photo former prime minister berlusconi and japanese former former former former prime minister mr aso you know because we have to change the prime minister ever year
and they are very kind affording my model
i proposed a big rebuilding a temporary music hall because laquila is very famous for music and all the concert halls were destroyed so musicians were moving out
so i proposed to the mayor id like to rebuild the temporary auditorium
he said as long as you bring your money you can do it
and i was very lucky
mr berlusconi brought summit and our former prime minister came so they helped us to collect money and i got half a million euros from the japanese government to rebuild this temporary auditorium
year in haiti there was a big earthquake but its impossible to fly over so i went to santo domingo next door country to drive six hours to get to haiti with the local students in santo domingo to build units of shelter out of local paper tubes
this is what happened in japan two years ago in northern japan
after the earthquake and tsunami people had to be evacuated in a big room like a gymnasium
but look at this theres no privacy
people suffer mentally and physically
so we went there to build partitions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain
however some of the facility authority doesnt want us to do it because they said simply its become more difficult to control them
but its really necessary to do it
they dont have enough flat area to build standard government single story housing like this one
look at this even civil government is doing such poor construction of the temporary housing so dense and so messy because there is no storage nothing water is leaking so i thought we have to make multi story building because theres no land and also its not very comfortable
so i proposed to the mayor while i was making partitions
finally i met a very nice mayor in onagawa village in miyagi
he asked me to build three story housing on baseball
i used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same but much more comfortable
many of the people want to stay here forever
i was very happy to hear that
now i am working in new zealand christchurch
about days before the japanese earthquake happened also they had a big earthquake and many japanese students were also killed and the most important cathedral of the city the symbol of christchurch was totally destroyed
and i was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral
so this is under construction
and id like to keep building monuments that are beloved by people
thank you very much

title zeresenay alemseged the search for humanitys roots title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript paleoanthropologist zeresenay alemseged looks for the roots of humanity in ethiopias badlands here he talks about finding the oldest skeleton of a humanoid child and how africa holds the clues to our humanity description
i have minutes to tell you what happened over the past six million years
all right
we all have come from a long way here in africa and converged in this region of africa which is a place where percent of our evolutionary process took place
and i say that not because i am african but its in africa that you find the earliest evidence for human ancestors upright walking traces even the first technologies in the form of stone tools
so we all are africans and welcome home
all right
im a paleoanthropologist and my job is to define mans place in nature and explore what makes us human
and today i will use selam the earliest child ever discovered to tell you a story of all of us
selam is our most complete skeleton of a three year old girl who lived and died million years ago
she belongs to the species known as australopithecus afarensis
you dont need to remember that
thats the lucy species and was found by my research team in december of in an area called dikika
its in the northeastern part of ethiopia
and selam means peace in many ethiopian languages
we use that name to celebrate peace in the region and in the planet
and the fact that it was the cover story of all these famous magazines gives you already an idea of her significance i think
after i was invited by ted i did some digging because thats what we do to know about my host
you dont just jump into an invitation
and i learned that the first technology appeared in the form of stone tools million years ago
first entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are years old
and evidence for first design comes years old beads
and you can do the same with your genes and track them back in time
and dna analysis of living humans and chimpanzees teaches us today that we diverged sometime around seven million years ago and that these two species share over percent of the same genetic material
i think knowing this is a very useful context within which we can think of our ancestry
however dna analysis informs us only about the beginning and the end telling us nothing about what happened in the middle
so for us paleoanthropologists our job is to find the hard evidence the fossil evidence to fill in this gap and see the different stages of development
because its only when you do that that you can talk about its only when you do that you can talk about how we looked like and how we behaved at different times and how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time
that then gives you an access to explore the biological mechanisms and forces that are responsible for this gradual change that made us what we are today
but finding the hard evidence is a very complicated endeavor
its a systematic and scientific approach which takes you to places that are remote hot hostile and often with no access
just to give you an example when i went to dikika where selam was found in and its about kilometers from addis ababa the capital of ethiopia
it took us only seven hours to do the first kilometers of the but took four solid hours to do the last only kilometers
with the help of the locals and using just shovels and picks i made my way
i was the first person to actually drive a car to the spot
when you get there this is what you see and its the vastness of the place which makes you feel helpless and vulnerable
and once you make it there the big question is where to start
and you find nothing for years and years
when i go to places like this which are paleontological sites its like going to a game park an extinct game park
but what you find are not the human remains such as selam and lucy on a day to day basis
you find elephants rhinos monkeys pigs etc
but you could ask how could these large mammals live in this desert environment
of course they cannot but im telling you already that the environment and the carrying capacity of this region was drastically different from what we have today
a very important environmental lesson could be learned from this
anyway once we made it there then its a game park as i said an extinct game park
and our ancestors lived in that game park but were just the minorities they were not as successful and as widespread as the homo sapiens that we are
to tell you just an example an anecdote about their rarity i was going to this place every year and would do fieldwork here and the assistants of course helped me do the surveys
they would find a bone and tell me here is what youre looking for
i would say no thats an elephant
again another one thats a monkey thats a pig etc
so one of my assistants who never went to school said to me listen zeray
you either dont know what youre looking for or youre looking in the wrong place he said
and i said why because there were elephants and lions and the people were scared and went somewhere else
lets go somewhere else
well he was very tired and its really tiring
it was then after such hard work and many frustrating years that we found selam and you see the face here covered by sandstone
and here is actually the spinal column and the whole torso encased in a sandstone block because she was buried by a river
what you have here seems to be nothing but contains an incredible amount of scientific information that helps us explore what makes us human
this is the earliest and most complete juvenile human ancestor ever found in the history of paleoanthropology an amazing piece of our long long history
there were these three people and me and i am taking the pictures thats why i am not in
how would you feel if you were me you have something extraordinary in your hand but you are in the middle of nowhere
the feeling i had was a deep and quiet happiness and excitement of course accompanied by a huge sense of responsibility of making sure everything is safe
here is a close up of the fossil after five years of cleaning preparation and description which was very long as i had to expose the bones from the sandstone block i just showed you in the previous slide
it took five years
in a way this was like the second birth for the child after million years but the labor was very long
and here is full scale its a tiny bone
and in the middle is the minister of ethiopian tourism who came to visit the national museum of ethiopia while i was working there
and you see me worried and trying to protect my child because you dont leave anyone with this kind of child even a minister
so then once youve done that the next stage is to know what it is
once that was done then it was possible to compare
we were able to tell that she belonged to the human family tree because the legs the foot and some features clearly showed that she walked upright and upright walking is a hallmark in humanity
but in addition if you compare the skull with a comparably aged chimpanzee and little george bush here you see that you have vertical forehead
and you see that in humans because of the development of the pre frontal cortex its called
you dont see that in chimpanzees and you dont see this very projecting canine
so she belongs to our family tree but within that of course you do detailed analysis and we know now that she belongs to the lucy species known as australopithecus afarensis
the next exciting question is girl or boy
and how old was she when she died
you can determine the sex of the individual based on the size of the teeth
how
you know in primates there is this phenomenon called sexual dimorphism which simply means males are larger than females and males have larger teeth than the females
but to do that you need the permanent dentition which you dont see here because what you have here are the baby teeth
but using the ct scanning technology which is normally used for medical purposes you can go deep into the mouth and come up with this beautiful image showing you both the baby teeth here and the still growing adult teeth here
so when you measure those teeth it was clear that she turned out to be a girl with very small canine teeth
and to know how old she was when she died what you do is you do an informed estimate and you say how much time would be required to form this amount of teeth and the answer was three
so this girl died when she was about three million years ago
so with all that information the big question is what do we actually what does she tell us
to answer this question we can phrase another question
what do we actually know about our ancestors
we want to know how they looked like how they behaved how they walked around and how they lived and grew up
and among the answers that you can get from this skeleton are included first this skeleton documents for the first time how infants looked over three million years ago
and second she tells us that she walked upright but had some adaptation for tree climbing
and more interesting however is the brain in this child was still growing
at age three if you have a still growing brain its a human behavior
in chimps by age three the brain is formed over percent
thats why they can cope with their environment very easily after birth faster than us anyway
but in humans we continue to grow our brains
thats why we need care from our parents
but that care means also you learn
you spend more time with your parents
and thats very characteristic of humans and its called childhood which is this extended dependence of human children on their family or parents
so the still growing brain in this individual tells us that childhood which requires an incredible social organization a very complex social organization emerged over three million years ago
so by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history selam unites us all and gives us a unique account on what makes us human
but not everything was human and i will give you a very exciting example
this is called the hyoid bone its a bone which is right here
it supports your tongue from behind
its in a way your voice box
it determines the type of voice you produce
it was not known in the fossil record and we have it in this skeleton
when we did the analysis of this bone it was clear that it looked very chimp like chimpanzee like
so if you were there million years ago to hear when this girl was crying out for her mother she would have sounded more like a chimpanzee than a human
maybe youre wondering so you see this ape feature human feature ape feature
what does that tell us
you know that is very exciting for us because it demonstrates that things were changing slowly and progressively and that evolution is in the making
to summarize the significance of this fossil we can say the following
up to now the knowledge that we had about our ancestors came essentially from adult individuals because the fossils the baby fossils were missing
they dont preserve well as you know
so the knowledge that we had about our ancestors on how they looked like how they behaved was kind of biased toward adults
imagine somebody coming from mars and his job is to report on the type of people occupying our planet earth and you hide all the babies the children and he goes back and reports
can you imagine how much biased his report would be
thats what somehow we were doing so far in the absence of the fossil children so i think the new fossil fixes this problem
so i think the most important question at the end is what do we actually learn from specimens like this and from our past in general
of course in addition to extracting this huge amount of scientific information as to what makes us human you know the many human ancestors that have existed over the past six million years and there are more than they did not have the knowledge the technology and sophistications that we homo sapiens have today
but if this species ancient species would travel in time and see us today they would very much be very proud of their legacy because they became the ancestors of the most successful species in the universe
and they were probably not aware of this future legacy but they did great
now the question is we homo sapiens today are in a position to decide about the future of our planet possibly more
so the question is are we up to the challenge
and can we really do better than these primitive small brained ancestors
among the most pressing challenges that our species is faced with today are the chronic problems of africa
needless to list them here and there are more competent people to talk about this
still in my opinion we have two choices
one is to continue to see a poor ill crying africa carrying guns that depends on other people forever or to promote an africa which is confident peaceful independent but cognizant of its huge problems and great values at the same time
i am for the second option and im sure many of you are
and the key is to promote a positive african attitude towards africa
thats because we africans concentrate i am from ethiopia by the way we concentrate too much on how we are seen from elsewhere or from outside
i think its important to promote in a more positive way on how we see ourselves
thats what i call positive african attitude
so finally i would like to say so lets help africa walk upright and forward then we all can be proud of our future legacy as a species
thank you

title neil burgess how your brain tells you where you are title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript how do you remember where you parked your car how do you know if youre moving in the right direction neuroscientist neil burgess studies the neural mechanisms that map the space around us and how they link to memory and imagination description
when we park in a big parking lot how do we remember where we parked our car
heres the problem facing homer
and were going to try to understand whats happening in his brain
so well start with the hippocampus shown in yellow which is the organ of memory
if you have damage there like in alzheimers you cant remember things including where you parked your car
its named after latin for seahorse which it resembles
and like the rest of the brain its made of neurons
so the human brain has about a hundred billion neurons in it
and the neurons communicate with each other by sending little pulses or spikes of electricity via connections to each other
the hippocampus is formed of two sheets of cells which are very densely interconnected
and scientists have begun to understand how spatial memory works by recording from individual neurons in rats or mice while they forage or explore an environment looking for food
so were going to imagine were recording from a single neuron in the hippocampus of this rat here
and when it fires a little spike of electricity theres going to be a red dot and a click
so what we see is that this neuron knows whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment
and it signals to the rest of the brain by sending a little electrical spike
so we could show the firing rate of that neuron as a function of the animals location
and if we record from lots of different neurons well see that different neurons fire when the animal goes in different parts of its environment like in this square box shown here
so together they form a map for the rest of the brain telling the brain continually where am i now within my environment
place cells are also being recorded in humans
so epilepsy patients sometimes need the electrical activity in their brain monitoring
and some of these patients played a video game where they drive around a small town
and place cells in their hippocampi would fire become active start sending electrical impulses whenever they drove through a particular location in that town
so how does a place cell know where the rat or person is within its environment
well these two cells here show us that the boundaries of the environment are particularly important
so the one on the top likes to fire sort of midway between the walls of the box that their rats in
and when you expand the box the firing location expands
the one below likes to fire whenever theres a wall close by to the south
and if you put another wall inside the box then the cell fires in both place wherever theres a wall to the south as the animal explores around in its box
so this predicts that sensing the distances and directions of boundaries around you extended buildings and so on is particularly important for the hippocampus
and indeed on the inputs to the hippocampus cells are found which project into the hippocampus which do respond exactly to detecting boundaries or edges at particular distances and directions from the rat or mouse as its exploring around
so the cell on the left you can see it fires whenever the animal gets near to a wall or a boundary to the east whether its the edge or the wall of a square box or the circular wall of the circular box or even the drop at the edge of a table which the animals are running around
and the cell on the right there fires whenever theres a boundary to the south whether its the drop at the edge of the table or a wall or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart
so thats one way in which we think place cells determine where the animal is as its exploring around
we can also test where we think objects are like this goal flag in simple environments or indeed where your car would be
so we can have people explore an environment and see the location they have to remember
and then if we put them back in the environment generally theyre quite good at putting a marker down where they thought that flag or their car was
but on some trials we could change the shape and size of the environment like we did with the place cell
in that case we can see how where they think the flag had been changes as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment
and what you see for example if the flag was where that cross was in a small square environment and then if you ask people where it was but youve made the environment bigger where they think the flag had been stretches out in exactly the same way that the place cell firing stretched out
its as if you remember where the flag was by storing the pattern of firing across all of your place cells at that location and then you can get back to that location by moving around so that you best match the current pattern of firing of your place cells with that stored pattern
that guides you back to the location that you want to remember
but we also know where we are through movement
so if we take some outbound path perhaps we park and we wander off we know because our own movements which we can integrate over this path roughly what the heading direction is to go back
and place cells also get this kind of path integration input from a kind of cell called a grid cell
now grid cells are found again on the inputs to the hippocampus and theyre a bit like place cells
but now as the rat explores around each individual cell fires in a whole array of different locations which are laid out across the environment in an amazingly regular triangular grid
and if you record from several grid cells shown here in different colors each one has a grid like firing pattern across the environment and each cells grid like firing pattern is shifted slightly relative to the other cells
so the red one fires on this grid and the green one on this one and the blue on on this one
so together its as if the rat can put a virtual grid of firing locations across its environment a bit like the latitude and longitude lines that youd find on a map but using triangles
and as it moves around the electrical activity can pass from one of these cells to the next cell to keep track of where it is so that it can use its own movements to know where it is in its environment
do people have grid cells
well because all of the grid like firing patterns have the same axes of symmetry the same orientations of grid shown in orange here it means that the net activity of all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain should change according to whether were running along these six directions or running along one of the six directions in between
so we can put people in an mri scanner and have them do a little video game like the one i showed you and look for this signal
and indeed you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats
so back to homer
hes probably remembering where his car was in terms of the distances and directions to extended buildings and boundaries around the location where he parked
and that would be represented by the firing of boundary detecting cells
hes also remembering the path he took out of the car park which would be represented in the firing of grid cells
now both of these kinds of cells can make the place cells fire
and he can return to the location where he parked by moving so as to find where it is that best matches the firing pattern of the place cells in his brain currently with the stored pattern where he parked his car
and that guides him back to that location irrespective of visual cues like whether his cars actually there
maybe its been towed
but he knows where it was so he knows to go and get it
so beyond spatial memory if we look for this grid like firing pattern throughout the whole brain we see it in a whole series of locations which are always active when we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks like remembering the last time you went to a wedding for example
so it may be that the neural mechanisms for representing the space around us are also used for generating visual imagery so that we can recreate the spatial scene at least of the events that have happened to us when we want to imagine them
so if this was happening your memories could start by place cells activating each other via these dense interconnections and then reactivating boundary cells to create the spatial structure of the scene around your viewpoint
and grid cells could move this viewpoint through that space
another kind of cell head direction cells which i didnt mention yet they fire like a compass according to which way youre facing
they could define the viewing direction from which you want to generate an image for your visual imagery so you can imagine what happened when you were at this wedding for example
so this is just one example of a new era really in cognitive neuroscience where were beginning to understand psychological processes like how you remember or imagine or even think in terms of the actions of the billions of individual neurons that make up our brains
thank you very much

title nigel marsh how to make work life balance work title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript work life balance says nigel marsh is too important to be left in the hands of your employer marsh lays out an ideal day balanced between family time personal time and productivity and offers some stirring encouragement to make it happen description
what i thought i would do is i would start with a simple request
id like all of you to pause for a moment you wretched weaklings and take stock of your miserable existence
now that was the advice that st benedict gave his rather startled followers in the fifth century
it was the advice that i decided to follow myself when i turned
up until that moment i had been that classic corporate warrior i was eating too much i was drinking too much i was working too hard and i was neglecting the family
and i decided that i would try and turn my life around
in particular i decided i would try to address the thorny issue of work life balance
so i stepped back from the workforce and i spent a year at home with my wife and four young children
but all i learned about work life balance from that year was that i found it quite easy to balance work and life when i didnt have any work
not a very useful skill especially when the money runs out
so i went back to work and ive spent these seven years since struggling with studying and writing about work life balance
and i have four observations id like to share with you today
the first is if societys to make any progress on this issue we need an honest debate
but the trouble is so many people talk so much rubbish about work life balance
all the discussions about flexi time or dress down fridays or paternity leave only serve to mask the core issue which is that certain job and career choices are fundamentally incompatible with being meaningfully engaged on a day to day basis with a young family
now the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the reality of the situation youre in
and the reality of the society that were in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet screaming desperation where they work long hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they dont need to impress people they dont like
its my contention that going to work on friday in jeans and t shirt isnt really getting to the nub of the issue
the second observation id like to make is we need to face the truth that governments and corporations arent going to solve this issue for us
we should stop looking outside
its up to us as individuals to take control and responsibility for the type of lives that we want to lead
if you dont design your life someone else will design it for you and you may just not like their idea of balance
its particularly important this isnt on the world wide web is it im about to get fired its particularly important that you never put the quality of your life in the hands of a commercial corporation
now im not talking here just about the bad companies the abattoirs of the human soul as i call them
im talking about all companies
because commercial companies are inherently designed to get as much out of you they can get away with
its in their nature its in their dna its what they do even the good well intentioned companies
on the one hand putting childcare facilities in the workplace is wonderful and enlightened
on the other hand its a nightmare it just means you spend more time at the bloody office
we have to be responsible for setting and enforcing the boundaries that we want in our life
the third observation is we have to be careful with the time frame that we choose upon which to judge our balance
before i went back to work after my year at home i sat down and i wrote out a detailed step by step description of the ideal balanced day that i aspired to
and it went like this wake up well rested after a good nights sleep
have sex
walk the dog
have breakfast with my wife and children
have sex again
drive the kids to school on the way to the office
do three hours work
play a sport with a friend at lunchtime
do another three hours work
meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink
drive home for dinner with my wife and kids
meditate for half an hour
have sex
walk the dog have sex again
go to bed
how often do you think i have that day
we need to be realistic
you cant do it all in one day
we need to elongate the time frame upon which we judge the balance in our life but we need to elongate it without falling into the trap of the ill have a life when i retire when my kids have left home when my wife has divorced me my health is failing ive got no mates or interests left
a day is too short after i retire is too long
theres got to be a middle way
a fourth observation we need to approach balance in a balanced way
a friend came to see me last year and she doesnt mind me telling this story a friend came to see me last year and said nigel ive read your book
and i realize that my life is completely out of balance
its totally dominated by work
i work hours a day i commute two hours a day
all of my relationships have failed
theres nothing in my life apart from my work
so ive decided to get a grip and sort it out
so i joined a gym
now i dont mean to mock but being a fit hour a day office rat isnt more balanced its more fit
lovely though physical exercise may be there are other parts to life theres the intellectual side theres the emotional side theres the spiritual side
and to be balanced i believe we have to attend to all of those areas not just do stomach crunches
now that can be daunting
because people say bloody hell mate i havent got time to get fit
you want me to go to church and call my mother
and i understand
i truly understand how that can be daunting
but an incident that happened a couple of years ago gave me a new perspective
my wife who is somewhere in the audience today called me up at the office and said nigel you need to pick our youngest son harry up from school
because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening
so i left work an hour early that afternoon and picked harry up at the school gates
we walked down to the local park messed around on the swings played some silly games
i then walked him up the hill to the local cafe and we shared a pizza for two then walked down the hill to our home and i gave him his bath and put him in his batman pajamas
i then read him a chapter of roald dahls james and the giant peach
i then put him to bed tucked him in gave him a kiss on his forehead and said goodnight mate and walked out of his bedroom
as i was walking out of his bedroom he said dad i went yes mate
he went dad this has been the best day of my life ever
i hadnt done anything hadnt taken him to disney world or bought him a playstation
now my point is the small things matter
being more balanced doesnt mean dramatic upheaval in your life
with the smallest investment in the right places you can radically transform the quality of your relationships and the quality of your life
moreover i think it can transform society
because if enough people do it we can change societys definition of success away from the moronically simplistic notion that the person with the most money when he dies wins to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well lived looks like
and that i think is an idea worth spreading

title sam harris science can answer moral questions title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript questions of good and evil right and wrong are commonly thought unanswerable by science but sam harris argues that science can and should be an authority on moral issues shaping human values and setting out what constitutes a good life description
im going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values
now its generally understood that questions of morality questions of good and evil and right and wrong are questions about which science officially has no opinion
its thought that science can help us get what we value but it can never tell us what we ought to value
and consequently most people i think most people probably here think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life questions like what is worth living for
what is worth dying for
what constitutes a good life
so im going to argue that this is an illusion that the separation between science and human values is an illusion and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history
now its often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values because science deals with facts and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres
its often thought that theres no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be
but i think this is quite clearly untrue
values are a certain kind of fact
they are facts about the well being of conscious creatures
why is it that we dont have ethical obligations toward rocks
why dont we feel compassion for rocks
its because we dont think rocks can suffer and if were more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects as indeed we are its because we think theyre exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering
now the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim this is something that we could be right or wrong about and if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects
and theres no notion no version of human morality and human values that ive ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible changes
even if you get your values from religion even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death either to an eternity of happiness with god or an eternity of suffering in hell you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes
and to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim which of course may or may not be true
now to speak about the conditions of well being in this life for human beings we know that there is a continuum of such facts
we know that its possible to live in a failed state where everything that can go wrong does go wrong where mothers cannot feed their children where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration where people are murdered indiscriminately
and we know that its possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable
and we know we know that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space
would adding cholera to the water be a good idea
probably not
would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors probably not
there are truths to be known about how human communities flourish whether or not we understand these truths
and morality relates to these truths
so in talking about values we are talking about facts
now of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements
but if were going to talk about human well being we are of necessity talking about the human brain
because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain whatever happens after death
even if the suicide bomber does get virgins in the afterlife in this life his personality his rather unfortunate personality is the product of his brain
so the contributions of culture if culture changes us as indeed it does it changes us by changing our brains
and so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can at least in principle be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind neuroscience psychology etc
so what im arguing is that values reduced to facts to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings
and we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings
and i think of this as kind of a moral landscape with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well being of conscious creatures both personal and collective
and one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well being that we rarely access that few people access
and these await our discovery
perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual
perhaps there are other states that we cant access because of how our minds are structured but other minds possibly could access them
now let me be clear about what im not saying im not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question
i dont think for instance that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child or whether we should bomb irans nuclear facilities or whether you can deduct the full cost of ted as a business expense
but if questions affect human well being then they do have answers whether or not we can find them
and just admitting this just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish will change the way we talk about morality and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future
for instance there are states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board hard and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin
and hundreds of thousands of children incidentally are subjected to this every year
the locations of these enlightened districts i think will fail to surprise you
were not talking about connecticut
and the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious
the creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod lest we spoil the child this is in proverbs and and i believe
but we can ask the obvious question is it a good idea generally speaking to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior
is there any doubt that this question has an answer and that it matters
now many of you might worry that the notion of well being is truly undefined and seemingly perpetually open to be re construed
and so how therefore can there be an objective notion of well being
well consider by analogy the concept of physical health
the concept of physical health is undefined
as we just heard from michael specter it has changed over the years
when this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably
its now around in the developed world
there may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age will be considered a profound disability
people will send you donations when youre in that condition
notice that the fact that the concept of health is open genuinely open for revision does not make it vacuous
the distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science
another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape there may be equivalent ways to thrive there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing
now why wouldnt this undermine an objective morality
well think of how we talk about food i would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat
there is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food
but theres nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison
the fact that there are many right answers to the question what is food
does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition
many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions
so for instance if its really wrong to lie it must always be wrong to lie and if you can find an exception well then theres no such thing as moral truth
why would we think this
consider by analogy the game of chess
now if youre going to play good chess a principle like dont lose your queen is very good to follow
but it clearly admits some exceptions
there are moments when losing your queen is a brilliant thing to do
there are moments when it is the only good thing you can do
and yet chess is a domain of perfect objectivity
the fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all
now this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere
consider the great problem of womens bodies what to do about them
well this is one thing you can do about them you can cover them up
now it is the position generally speaking of our intellectual community that while we may not like this we might think of this as wrong in boston or palo alto who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags
and who are we to say even that theyre wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way
well who are we not to say this
who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well being that we have to be non judgmental about a practice like this
im not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil women should be able to wear whatever they want as far as im concerned
but what does voluntary mean in a community where when a girl gets raped her fathers first impulse rather often is to murder her out of shame
just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute your daughter gets raped and what you want to do is kill her
what are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing
now to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society
for instance this is what its like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world
now granted for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images
but if we are in a reflective mood we can ask is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and womens bodies
i mean is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children
probably not ok so perhaps theres some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance
perhaps there are many such places again given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape
but the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak
now the irony from my perspective is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another
and of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well being
in fact the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering
this is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue
but the demagogues are right about one thing we need a universal conception of human values
now what stands in the way of this
well one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality especially secular academic scientist types
when talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we dont in any other area of our lives
so for instance the dalai lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness
on the other hand we have someone like ted bundy ted bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women
so we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use ones time
most western intellectuals look at this situation and say well theres nothing for the dalai lama to be really right about really right about or for ted bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science
he likes chocolate he likes vanilla
theres nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other
notice that we dont do this in science
on the left you have edward witten
hes a string theorist
if you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around in my experience half of them will say ed witten
the other half will tell you they dont like the question
so what would happen if i showed up at a physics conference and said string theory is bogus
it doesnt resonate with me its not how i chose to view the universe at a small scale
im not a fan
well nothing would happen because im not a physicist i dont understand string theory
im the ted bundy of string theory
i wouldnt want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member
but this is just the point
whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded
that is what it is to have a domain of expertise
that is what it is for knowledge to count
how have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise or moral talent or moral genius even
how have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count
how have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering
does the taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering no
how is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well being
so this i think is what the world needs now
it needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing and morality relates to that domain of facts
it is possible for individuals and even for whole cultures to care about the wrong things which is to say that its possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering
just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality
we live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less and they will one day mean nothing
we live in a world filled with destructive technology and this technology cannot be uninvented it will always be easier to break things than to fix them
it seems to me therefore patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human well being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes
we simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life
and to do that we have to admit that these questions have answers
thank you very much
chris anderson so some combustible material there
whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world hearing some of this may well be doing the screaming with rage thing after as well some of them
language seems to be really important here
when youre talking about the veil youre talking about women dressed in cloth bags
ive lived in the muslim world spoken with a lot of muslim women
and some of them would say something else they would say no you know this is a celebration of female specialness it helps build that and its a result of the fact that and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view that male lust is not to be trusted
i mean can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist
sam harris yeah well i think i tried to broach this in a sentence watching the clock ticking but the question is what is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations and youre guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you dont veil yourself
and so if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil or a very funny hat or tattoo their face i think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under
and so i think we shouldnt be so eager to always take their word for it especially when its degrees out and youre wearing a full burqa
ca a lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress
but can you reconcile that
i think i understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesnt become one dimensional where we all have to think the same
paint your picture of what rolling the clock years forward years forward how you would like to think of the world balancing moral progress with richness
sh well i think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail
so were going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion and were going to understand the factors that encourage it whether theyre genetic whether theyre how people talk to one another whether theyre economic systems and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on that fact space
so everything is not going to be up for grabs
its not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well educated in the context of men who do desire women
i mean i dont think we need an nsf grant to know that compulsory veiling is a bad idea but at a certain point were going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them
do people love their daughters just as much in these systems
and i think there are clearly right answers to that
ca and if the results come out that actually they do are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues
sh well yeah modulo one obvious fact that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system
so you can say like because i knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend i chopped his head off and that was the most compassionate thing i could do
if you get all those parts aligned yes i think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love
but again then we have to talk about well being in a larger context
its all of us in this together not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus
ca sam this is a conversation i would actually love to continue for hours
we dont have that but maybe another time thank you for coming to ted
sh really an honor thank you

title kavita ramdas radical women embracing tradition title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript investing in women can unlock infinite potential around the globe but how can women walk the line between western style empowerment and traditional culture kavita ramdas of the global fund for women talks about three encounters with powerful women who fight to make the world better while preserving the traditions that sustain them description
salaam namaskar
good morning
given my ted profile you might be expecting that im going to speak to you about the latest philanthropic trends the one thats currently got wall street and the world bank buzzing how to invest in women how to empower them how to save them
not me
i am interested in how women are saving us
theyre saving us by redefining and re imagining a future that defies and blurs accepted polarities polarities weve taken for granted for a long time like the ones between modernity and tradition first world and third world oppression and opportunity
in the midst of the daunting challenges we face as a global community theres something about this third way raga that is making my heart sing
what intrigues me most is how women are doing this despite a set of paradoxes that are both frustrating and fascinating
why is it that women are on the one hand viciously oppressed by cultural practices and yet at the same time are the preservers of cultures in most societies
is the hijab or the headscarf a symbol of submission or resistance
when so many women and girls are beaten raped maimed on a daily basis in the name of all kinds of causes honor religion nationality what allows women to replant trees to rebuild societies to lead radical non violent movements for social change
is it different women who are doing the preserving and the radicalizing
or are they one and the same
are we guilty as chimamanda adichie reminded us at the ted conference in oxford of assuming that there is a single story of womens struggles for their rights while there are in fact many
and what if anything do men have to do with it
much of my life has been a quest to get some answers to these questions
its taken me across the globe and introduced me to some amazing people
in the process ive gathered a few fragments that help me shed some light on this puzzle
among those whove helped open my eyes to a third way are a devout muslim in afghanistan a group of harmonizing lesbians in croatia and a taboo breaker in liberia
im indebted to them as i am to my parents who for some set of misdemeanors in their last life were blessed with three daughters in this one
and for reasons equally unclear to me seem to be inordinately proud of the three of us
i was born and raised here in india and i learned from an early age to be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles who would bend down pat us on the head and then say to my parents with no problem at all poor things you only have three daughters
but youre young you could still try again
my sense of outrage about womens rights was brought to a boil when i was about
my aunt an incredibly articulate and brilliant woman was widowed early
a flock of relatives descended on her
they took off her colorful sari
they made her wear a white one
they wiped her bindi off her forehead
they broke her bangles
her daughter rani a few years older than me sat in her lap bewildered not knowing what had happened to the confident woman she once knew as her mother
late that night i heard my mother begging my father please do something ramu cant you intervene
and my father in a low voice muttering im just the youngest brother theres nothing i can do
this is tradition
thats the night i learned the rules about what it means to be female in this world
women dont make those rules but they define us and they define our opportunities and our chances
and men are affected by those rules too
my father who had fought in three wars could not save his own sister from this suffering
by under the excellent tutelage of my mother i was therefore as you might expect defiantly feminist
on the streets chanting we are the women of india
we are not flowers we are sparks of change
by the time i got to beijing in it was clear to me the only way to achieve gender equality was to overturn centuries of oppressive tradition
soon after i returned from beijing i leapt at the chance to work for this wonderful organization founded by women to support womens rights organizations around the globe
but barely six months into my new job i met a woman who forced me to challenge all my assumptions
her name is sakena yacoobi
she walked into my office at a time when no one knew where afghanistan was in the united states
she said to me it is not about the burka
she was the most determined advocate for womens rights i had ever heard
she told me women were running underground schools in her communities inside afghanistan and that her organization the afghan institute of learning had started a school in pakistan
she said the first thing anyone who is a muslim knows is that the koran requires and strongly supports literacy
the prophet wanted every believer to be able to read the koran for themselves
had i heard right
was a womens rights advocate invoking religion
but sakena defies labels
she always wears a headscarf but ive walked alongside with her on a beach with her long hair flying in the breeze
she starts every lecture with a prayer but shes a single feisty financially independent woman in a country where girls are married off at the age of
she is also immensely pragmatic
this headscarf and these clothes she says give me the freedom to do what i need to do to speak to those whose support and assistance are critical for this work
when i had to open the school in the refugee camp i went to see the imam
i told him im a believer and women and children in these terrible conditions need their faith to survive she smiles slyly
he was flattered
he began to come twice a week to my center because women could not go to the mosque
and after he would leave women and girls would stay behind
we began with a small literacy class to read the koran then a math class then an english class then computer classes
in a few weeks everyone in the refugee camp was in our classes
sakena is a teacher at a time when to educate women is a dangerous business in afghanistan
she is on the talibans hit list
i worry about her every time she travels across that country
she shrugs when i ask her about safety
kavita jaan we cannot allow ourselves to be afraid
look at those young girls who go back to school when acid is thrown in their face
and i smile and i nod realizing im watching women and girls using their own religious traditions and practices turning them into instruments of opposition and opportunity
their path is their own and it looks towards an afghanistan that will be different
being different is something the women of lesbor in zagreb croatia know all too well
to be a lesbian a dyke a homosexual in most parts of the world including right here in our country india is to occupy a place of immense discomfort and extreme prejudice
in post conflict societies like croatia where a hyper nationalism and religiosity have created an environment unbearable for anyone who might be considered a social outcast
so enter a group of out dykes young women who love the old music that once spread across that region from macedonia to bosnia from serbia to slovenia
these folk singers met at college at a gender studies program
many are in their some are mothers
many have struggled to come out to their communities in families whose religious beliefs make it hard to accept that their daughters are not sick just queer
as leah one of the founders of the group says i like traditional music very much
i also like rock and roll
so lesbor we blend the two
i see traditional music like a kind of rebellion in which people can really speak their voice especially traditional songs from other parts of the former yugoslav republic
after the war lots of these songs were lost but they are a part of our childhood and our history and we should not forget them
improbably this lgbt singing choir has demonstrated how women are investing in tradition to create change like alchemists turning discord into harmony
their repertoire includes the croatian national anthem a bosnian love song and serbian duets
and leah adds with a grin kavita we especially are proud of our christmas music because it shows we are open to religious practices even though catholic church hates us lgbt
their concerts draw from their own communities yes but also from an older generation a generation that might be suspicious of homosexuality but is nostalgic for its own music and the past it represents
one father who had initially balked at his daughter coming out in such a choir now writes songs for them
in the middle ages troubadours would travel across the land singing their tales and sharing their verses lesbor travels through the balkans like this singing connecting people divided by religion nationality and language
bosnians croats and serbs find a rare shared space of pride in their history and lesbor reminds them that the songs one group often claims as theirs alone really belong to them all
yesterday mallika sarabhai showed us that music can create a world more accepting of difference than the one we have been given
the world leymah gbowee was given was a world at war
liberia had been torn apart by civil strife for decades
leymah was not an activist she was a mother of three
but she was sick with worry she worried her son would be abducted and taken off to be a child soldier she worried her daughters would be raped she worried for their lives
one night she had a dream
she dreamt she and thousands of other women ended the bloodshed
the next morning at church she asked others how they felt
they were all tired of the fighting
we need peace and we need our leaders to know we will not rest until there is peace
among leymahs friends was a policewoman who was muslim
she promised to raise the issue with her community
at the next friday sermon the women who were sitting in the side room of the mosque began to share their distress at the state of affairs
what does it matter they said a bullet doesnt distinguish between a muslim and a christian
this small group of women determined to bring an end to the war and they chose to use their traditions to make a point liberian women usually wear lots of jewelry and colorful clothing
but no for the protest they dressed all in white no makeup
as leymah said we wore the white saying we were out for peace
they stood on the side of the road on which charles taylors motorcade passed every day
they stood for weeks first just then then then hundreds of women wearing white singing dancing saying they were out for peace
eventually opposing forces in liberia were pushed to hold peace talks in ghana
the peace talks dragged on and on and on
leymah and her sisters had had enough
with their remaining funds they took a small group of women down to the venue of the peace talks and they surrounded the building
in a now famous cnn clip you can see them sitting on the ground their arms linked
we know this in india its called a
then things get tense
the police are called in to physically remove the women
as the senior officer approaches with a baton leymah stands up with deliberation reaches her arms up over her head and begins very slowly to untie her headdress that covers her hair
you can see the policemans face
he looks embarrassed he backs away
and the next thing you know the police have disappeared
leymah said to me later its a taboo you know in west africa
if an older woman undresses in front of a man because she wants to the mans family is cursed
she said i dont know if he did it because he believed but he knew we were not going to leave
we were not going to leave until the peace accord was signed
and the peace accord was signed
and the women of liberia then mobilized in support of ellen johnson sirleaf a woman who broke a few taboos herself becoming the first elected woman head of state in africa in years
when she made her presidential address she acknowledged these brave women of liberia who allowed her to win against a football star thats soccer for you americans no less
women like sakena and leah and leymah have humbled me and changed me and made me realize that i should not be so quick to jump to assumptions of any kind
theyve also saved me from my righteous anger by offering insights into this third way
a filipina activist once said to me how do you cook a rice cake
with heat from the bottom and heat from the top
the protests the marches the uncompromising position that womens rights are human rights full stop
thats the heat from the bottom
thats malcolm x and the suffragists and gay pride parades
but we also need the heat from the top
and in most parts of the world that top is still controlled by men
so to paraphrase marx women make change but not in circumstances of their own choosing
they have to negotiate
they have to subvert tradition that once silenced them in order to give voice to new aspirations
and they need allies from their communities
allies like the imam allies like the father who now writes songs for a lesbian group in croatia allies like the policeman who honored a taboo and backed away allies like my father who couldnt help his sister but has helped three daughters pursue their dreams
maybe this is because feminism unlike almost every other social movement is not a struggle against a distinct oppressor its not the ruling class or the occupiers or the colonizers its against a deeply held set of beliefs and assumptions that we women far too often hold ourselves
and perhaps this is the ultimate gift of feminism that the personal is in fact the political
so that as eleanor roosevelt said once of human rights the same is true of gender equality that it starts in small places close to home
on the streets yes but also in negotiations at the kitchen table and in the marital bed and in relationships between lovers and parents and sisters and friends
and then you realize that by integrating aspects of tradition and community into their struggles women like sakena and leah and leymah but also women like sonia gandhi here in india and michelle bachelet in chile and shirin ebadi in iran are doing something else
theyre challenging the very notion of western models of development
they are saying we dont have to be like you to make change
we can wear a sari or a hijab or pants or a boubou and we can be party leaders and presidents and human rights lawyers
we can use our tradition to navigate change
we can demilitarize societies and pour resources instead into reservoirs of genuine security
it is in these little stories these individual stories that i see a radical epic being written by women around the world
it is in these threads that are being woven into a resilient fabric that will sustain communities that i find hope
and if my heart is singing its because in these little fragments every now and again you catch a glimpse of a whole of a whole new world
and she is definitely on her way
thank you

title kathryn schulz on being wrong title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript most of us will do anything to avoid being wrong but what if were wrong about that wrongologist kathryn schulz makes a compelling case for not just admitting but embracing our fallibility description
so its im in college and a friend and i go on a road trip from providence rhode island to portland oregon
and you know were young and unemployed so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests basically the longest route we can possibly take
and somewhere in the middle of south dakota i turn to my friend and i ask her a question thats been bothering me for miles
whats up with the chinese character i keep seeing by the side of the road
my friend looks at me totally blankly
theres actually a gentleman in the front row whos doing a perfect imitation of her look
and im like you know all the signs we keep seeing with the chinese character on them
she just stares at me for a few moments and then she cracks up because she figures out what im talking about
and what im talking about is this
right the famous chinese character for picnic area
ive spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us and how we behave when that happens and what all of this can tell us about human nature
in other words as you heard chris say ive spent the last five years thinking about being wrong
this might strike you as a strange career move but it actually has one great advantage no job competition
in fact most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong
we get it in the abstract
we all know everybody in this room makes mistakes
the human species in general is fallible okay fine
but when it comes down to me right now to all the beliefs i hold here in the present tense suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window and i cant actually think of anything im wrong about
and the thing is the present tense is where we live
we go to meetings in the present tense we go on family vacations in the present tense we go to the polls and vote in the present tense
so effectively we all kind of wind up traveling through life trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything
i think this is a problem
i think its a problem for each of us as individuals in our personal and professional lives and i think its a problem for all of us collectively as a culture
so what i want to do today is first of all talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right
and second why its such a problem
and finally i want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so it is the single greatest moral intellectual and creative leap you can make
so why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right
one reason actually has to do with a feeling of being wrong
so let me ask you guys something or actually let me ask you guys something because youre right here how does it feel emotionally how does it feel to be wrong
dreadful thumbs down
embarrassing okay wonderful great
dreadful thumbs down embarrassing thank you these are great answers but theyre answers to a different question
you guys are answering the question how does it feel to realize youre wrong
realizing youre wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things right
i mean it can be devastating it can be revelatory it can actually be quite funny like my stupid chinese character mistake
but just being wrong doesnt feel like anything
ill give you an analogy
do you remember that loony tunes cartoon where theres this pathetic coyote whos always chasing and never catching a roadrunner
in pretty much every episode of this cartoon theres a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner and the roadrunner runs off a cliff which is fine hes a bird he can fly
but the thing is the coyote runs off the cliff right after him
and whats funny at least if youre six years old is that the coyotes totally fine too
he just keeps running right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that hes in mid air
thats when he falls
when were wrong about something not when we realize it but before that were like that coyote after hes gone off the cliff and before he looks down
you know were already wrong were already in trouble but we feel like were on solid ground
so i should actually correct something i said a moment ago
it does feel like something to be wrong it feels like being right
so this is one reason a structural reason why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness
i call this error blindness
most of the time we dont have any kind of internal cue to let us know that were wrong about something until its too late
but theres a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well and this one is cultural
think back for a moment to elementary school
youre sitting there in class and your teacher is handing back quiz papers and one of them looks like this
this is not mine by the way
so there you are in grade school and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper
its the dumb kid the troublemaker the one who never does his homework
so by the time you are nine years old youve already learned first of all that people who get stuff wrong are lazy irresponsible dimwits and second of all that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes
we learn these really bad lessons really well
and a lot of us and i suspect especially a lot of us in this room deal with them by just becoming perfect little a students perfectionists over achievers
right mr cfo astrophysicist ultra marathoner
youre all cfo astrophysicists ultra marathoners it turns out
okay so fine
except that then we freak out at the possibility that weve gotten something wrong
because according to this getting something wrong means theres something wrong with us
so we just insist that were right because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe
so let me tell you a story
a couple of years ago a woman comes into beth israel deaconess medical center for a surgery
beth israels in boston
its the teaching hospital for harvard one of the best hospitals in the country
so this woman comes in and shes taken into the operating room
shes anesthetized the surgeon does his thing stitches her back up sends her out to the recovery room
everything seems to have gone fine
and she wakes up and she looks down at herself and she says why is the wrong side of my body in bandages
well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one
when the vice president for health care quality at beth israel spoke about this incident he said something very interesting
he said for whatever reason the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient
the point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous
this internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world
and when we act like it is and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong well thats when we end up doing things like dumping million gallons of oil into the gulf of mexico or torpedoing the global economy
so this is a huge practical problem
but its also a huge social problem
think for a moment about what it means to feel right
it means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality
and when you feel that way youve got a problem to solve which is how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you
it turns out most of us explain those people the same way by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions
the first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume theyre ignorant
they dont have access to the same information that we do and when we generously share that information with them theyre going to see the light and come on over to our team
when that doesnt work when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us then we move on to a second assumption which is that theyre idiots
they have all the right pieces of the puzzle and they are too moronic to put them together correctly
and when that doesnt work when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart then we move on to a third assumption they know the truth and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes
so this is a catastrophe
this attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly
but to me whats most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human
its like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds
and we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing
that is not true and if it were life would be incredibly boring
the miracle of your mind isnt that you can see the world as it is
its that you can see the world as it isnt
we can remember the past and we can think about the future and we can imagine what its like to be some other person in some other place
and we all do this a little differently which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this
and yeah it is also why we get things wrong
years before descartes said his famous thing about i think therefore i am this guy st augustine sat down and wrote fallor ergo sum i err therefore i am
augustine understood that our capacity to screw up its not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system something we can eradicate or overcome
its totally fundamental to who we are
because unlike god we dont really know whats going on out there
and unlike all of the other animals we are obsessed with trying to figure it out
to me this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity
last year for various reasons i found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the public radio show this american life
and so im listening and im listening and at some point i start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong
and my first thought was ive lost it
ive become the crazy wrongness lady
i just imagined it everywhere which has happened
but a couple of months later i actually had a chance to interview ira glass whos the host of the show
and i mentioned this to him and he was like no actually thats true
in fact he says as a staff we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto theme
and the crypto theme is i thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead and the thing is says ira glass we need this
we need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work
and for the rest of us audience members as listeners as readers we eat this stuff up
we love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings
when it comes to our stories we love being wrong
but you know our stories are like this because our lives are like this
we think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead
george bush thought he was going to invade iraq find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction liberate the people and bring democracy to the middle east
and something else happened instead
and hosni mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of egypt for the rest of his life until he got too old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son
and something else happened instead
and maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together
and something else happened instead
and i have to tell you that i thought i was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize
and something else happened instead
i mean this is life
for good and for ill we generate these incredible stories about the world around us and then the world turns around and astonishes us
no offense but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong
we just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements
because half the stuff thats the most mind boggling and world altering ted eh
didnt really work out that way did it
wheres my jet pack chris
so here we are again
and thats how it goes
we come up with another idea
we tell another story
we hold another conference
the theme of this one as you guys have now heard seven million times is the rediscovery of wonder
and to me if you really want to rediscover wonder you need to step outside of that tiny terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say wow i dont know
maybe im wrong
thank you
thank you guys

title leymah gbowee unlock the intelligence passion greatness of girls title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript nobel peace prize winner leymah gbowee has two powerful stories to tell of her own lifes transformation and of the untapped potential of girls around the world can we transform the world by unlocking the greatness of girls description
many times i go around the world to speak and people ask me questions about the challenges my moments some of my regrets
a single mother of four three months after the birth of my fourth child i went to do a job as a research assistant
i went to northern liberia
and as part of the work the village would give you lodgings
and they gave me lodging with a single mother and her daughter
this girl happened to be the only girl in the entire village who had made it to the ninth grade
she was the laughing stock of the community
her mother was often told by other women you and your child will die poor
after two weeks of working in that village it was time to go back
the mother came to me knelt down and said leymah take my daughter
i wish for her to be a nurse
dirt poor living in the home with my parents i couldnt afford to
with tears in my eyes i said no
two months later i go to another village on the same assignment and they asked me to live with the village chief
the womens chief of the village has this little girl fair color like me totally dirty
and all day she walked around only in her underwear
when i asked who is that
she said thats wei
the meaning of her name is pig
her mother died while giving birth to her and no one had any idea who her father was
for two weeks she became my companion slept with me
i bought her used clothes and bought her her first doll
the night before i left she came to the room and said leymah dont leave me here
i wish to go with you
i wish to go to school
dirt poor no money living with my parents i again said no
two months later both of those villages fell into another war
till today i have no idea where those two girls are
fast forward in the peak of our activism the minister of gender liberia called me and said leymah i have a nine year old for you
i want you to bring her home because we dont have safe homes
the story of this little girl she had been raped by her paternal grandfather every day for six months
she came to me bloated very pale
every night id come from work and lie on the cold floor
shed lie beside me and say auntie i wish to be well
i wish to go to school
a young woman stands before president sirleaf and gives her testimony of how she and her siblings live together their father and mother died during the war
shes her dream is to go to college to be able to support them
shes highly athletic
one of the things that happens is that she applies for a scholarship
full scholarship she gets it
her dream of going to school her wish of being educated is finally here
she goes to school on the first day
the director of sports whos responsible for getting her into the program asks her to come out of class
and for the next three years her fate will be having sex with him every day as a favor for getting her in school
globally we have policies international instruments work leaders
great people have made commitments we will protect our children from want and from fear
the u n has the convention on the rights of the child
countries like america weve heard things like no child left behind
other countries come with different things
there is a millennium development called three that focuses on girls
all of these great works by great people aimed at getting young people to where we want to get them globally i think has failed
in liberia for example the teenage pregnancy rate is three to every girls
teen prostitution is at its peak
in one community were told you wake up in the morning and see used condoms like used chewing gum paper
girls as young as being prostituted for less than a dollar a night
its disheartening its sad
and then someone asked me just before my tedtalk a few days ago so where is the hope
several years ago a few friends of mine decided we needed to bridge the disconnect between our generation and the generation of young women
its not enough to say you have two nobel laureates from the republic of liberia when your girls kids are totally out there and no hope or seemingly no hope
we created a space called the young girls transformative project
we go into rural communities and all we do like has been done in this room is create the space
when these girls sit you unlock intelligence you unlock passion you unlock commitment you unlock focus you unlock great leaders
today weve worked with over
and some of those girls who walked in the room very shy have taken bold steps as young mothers to go out there and advocate for the rights of other young women
one young woman i met teen mother of four never thought about finishing high school graduated successfully never thought about going to college enrolled in college
one day she said to me my wish is to finish college and be able to support my children
shes at a place where she cant find money to go to school
she sells water sells soft drinks and sells recharge cards for cellphones
and you would think she would take that money and put it back into her education
juanita is her name
she takes that money and finds single mothers in her community to send back to school
says leymah my wish is to be educated
and if i cant be educated when i see some of my sisters being educated my wish has been fulfilled
i wish for a better life
i wish for food for my children
i wish that sexual abuse and exploitation in schools would stop
this is the dream of the african girl
several years ago there was one african girl
this girl had a son who wished for a piece of doughnut because he was extremely hungry
angry frustrated really upset about the state of her society and the state of her children this young girl started a movement a movement of ordinary women banding together to build peace
i will fulfill the wish
this is another african girls wish
i failed to fulfill the wish of those two girls
i failed to do this
these were the things that were going through the head of this other young woman i failed i failed i failed
so i will do this
women came out protested a brutal dictator fearlessly spoke
not only did the wish of a piece of doughnut come true the wish of peace came true
this young woman wished also to go to school
she went to school
this young woman wished for other things to happen it happened for her
today this young woman is me a nobel laureate
im now on a journey to fulfill the wish in my tiny capacity of little african girls the wish of being educated
we set up a foundation
were giving full four year scholarships to girls from villages that we see with potential
i dont have much to ask of you
ive also been to places in this u s and i know that girls in this country also have wishes a wish for a better life somewhere in the bronx a wish for a better life somewhere in downtown l a a wish for a better life somewhere in texas a wish for a better life somewhere in new york a wish for a better life somewhere in new jersey
will you journey with me to help that girl be it an african girl or an american girl or a japanese girl fulfill her wish fulfill her dream achieve that dream
because all of these great innovators and inventors that weve talked to and seen over the last few days are also sitting in tiny corners in different parts of the world and all theyre asking us to do is create that space to unlock the intelligence unlock the passion unlock all of the great things that they hold within themselves
lets journey together lets journey together
thank you
chris anderson thank you so much
right now in liberia what do you see as the main issue that troubles you
lg ive been asked to lead the liberian reconciliation initiative
as part of my work im doing these tours in different villages and towns hours on dirt roads and there is no community that ive gone into that i havent seen intelligent girls
but sadly the vision of a great future or the dream of a great future is just a dream because you have all of these vices
teen pregnancy like i said is epidemic
so what troubles me is that i was at that place and somehow im at this place and i just dont want to be the only one at this place
im looking for ways for other girls to be with me
i want to look back years from now and see that theres another liberian girl ghanaian girl nigerian girl ethiopian girl standing on this ted stage
and maybe just maybe saying because of that nobel laureate im here today
so im troubled when i see them like theres no hope
but im also not pessimistic because i know it doesnt take a lot to get them charged up
ca and in the last year tell us one hopeful thing that youve seen happening
lg i can tell you many hopeful things that ive seen happening
but in the last year where president sirleaf comes from her village we went there to work with these girls
and we could not find girls in high school
all of these girls went to the gold mine and they were predominantly prostitutes doing other things
we took of those girls and we worked with them
and this was at the beginning of elections
this is one place where women were never even the older ones barely sat in the circle with the men
these girls banded together and formed a group and launched a campaign for voter registration
this is a real rural village
and the theme they used was even pretty girls vote
they were able to mobilize young women
but not only did they do that they went to those who were running for seats to ask them what is it that you will give the girls of this community when you win
and one of the guys who already had a seat was very because liberia has one of the strongest rape laws and he was one of those really fighting in parliament to overturn that law because he called it barbaric
rape is not barbaric but the law he said was barbaric
and when the girls started engaging him he was very hostile towards them
these little girls turned to him and said we will vote you out of office
hes out of office today
ca leymah thank you thank you so much for coming to ted
lg youre welcome

title leslie t chang the voices of chinas workers title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript in the ongoing debate about globalization whats been missing is the voices of workers the millions of people who migrate to factories in china and other emerging countries to make goods sold all over the world reporter leslie t chang sought out women who work in one of chinas booming megacities and tells their stories description
hi so id like to talk a little bit about the people who make the things we use every day our shoes our handbags our computers and cell phones
now this is a conversation that often calls up a lot of guilt
imagine the teenage farm girl who makes less than a dollar an hour stitching your running shoes or the young chinese man who jumps off a rooftop after working overtime assembling your ipad
we the beneficiaries of globalization seem to exploit these victims with every purchase we make and the injustice feels embedded in the products themselves
after all whats wrong with a world in which a worker on an iphone assembly line cant even afford to buy one
its taken for granted that chinese factories are oppressive and that its our desire for cheap goods that makes them so
so this simple narrative equating western demand and chinese suffering is appealing especially at a time when many of us already feel guilty about our impact on the world but its also inaccurate and disrespectful
we must be peculiarly self obsessed to imagine that we have the power to drive tens of millions of people on the other side of the world to migrate and suffer in such terrible ways
in fact china makes goods for markets all over the world including its own thanks to a combination of factors its low costs its large and educated workforce and a flexible manufacturing system that responds quickly to market demands
by focusing so much on ourselves and our gadgets we have rendered the individuals on the other end into invisibility as tiny and interchangeable as the parts of a mobile phone
chinese workers are not forced into factories because of our insatiable desire for ipods
they choose to leave their homes in order to earn money to learn new skills and to see the world
in the ongoing debate about globalization whats been missing is the voices of the workers themselves
here are a few
bao yongxiu my mother tells me to come home and get married but if i marry now before i have fully developed myself i can only marry an ordinary worker so im not in a rush
chen ying when i went home for the new year everyone said i had changed they asked me what did you do that you have changed so much
i told them that i studied and worked hard if you tell them more they wont understand anyway
wu chunming even if i make a lot of money it wont satisfy me
just to make money is not enough meaning in life
xiao jin now after i get off work i study english because in the future our customers wont be only chinese so we must learn more languages
all of these speakers by the way are young women or years old
so i spent two years getting to know assembly line workers like these in the south china factory city called dongguan
certain subjects came up over and over how much money they made what kind of husband they hoped to marry whether they should jump to another factory or stay where they were
other subjects came up almost never including living conditions that to me looked close to prison life or workers in one room people sharing a single bathroom days and nights ruled by the factory clock
everyone they knew lived in similar circumstances and it was still better than the dormitories and homes of rural china
the workers rarely spoke about the products they made and they often had great difficulty explaining what exactly they did
when i asked lu qingmin the young woman i got to know best what exactly she did on the factory floor she said something to me in chinese that sounded like qiu xi
only much later did i realize that she had been saying qc or quality control
she couldnt even tell me what she did on the factory floor
all she could do was parrot a garbled abbreviation in a language she didnt even understand
karl marx saw this as the tragedy of capitalism the alienation of the worker from the product of his labor
unlike say a traditional maker of shoes or cabinets the worker in an industrial factory has no control no pleasure and no true satisfaction or understanding in her own work
but like so many theories that marx arrived at sitting in the reading room of the british museum he got this one wrong
just because a person spends her time making a piece of something does not mean that she becomes that a piece of something
what she does with the money she earns what she learns in that place and how it changes her these are the things that matter
what a factory makes is never the point and the workers could not care less who buys their products
journalistic coverage of chinese factories on the other hand plays up this relationship between the workers and the products they make
many articles calculate how long would it take for this worker to work in order to earn enough money to buy what hes making
for example an entry level line assembly line worker in china in an iphone plant would have to shell out two and a half months wages for an iphone
but how meaningful is this calculation really
for example i recently wrote an article in the new yorker magazine but i cant afford to buy an ad in it
but who cares i dont want an ad in the new yorker and most of these workers dont really want iphones
their calculations are different
how long should i stay in this factory
how much money can i save
how much will it take to buy an apartment or a car to get married or to put my child through school
the workers i got to know had a curiously abstract relationship with the product of their labor
about a year after i met lu qingmin or min she invited me home to her family village for the chinese new year
on the train home she gave me a present a coach brand change purse with brown leather trim
i thanked her assuming it was fake like almost everything else for sale in dongguan
after we got home min gave her mother another present a pink dooney amp bourke handbag and a few nights later her sister was showing off a maroon lesportsac shoulder bag
slowly it was dawning on me that these handbags were made by their factory and every single one of them was authentic
mins sister said to her parents in america this bag sells for dollars
her parents who are both farmers looked on speechless
and thats not all coach is coming out with a new line she said one bag will sell for
she paused and said i dont know if thats yuan or american dollars but anyway its
mins sisters boyfriend who had traveled home with her for the new year said it doesnt look like its worth that much
mins sister turned to him and said some people actually understand these things you dont understand shit
in mins world the coach bags had a curious currency
they werent exactly worthless but they were nothing close to the actual value because almost no one they knew wanted to buy one or knew how much it was worth
once when mins older sisters friend got married she brought a handbag along as a wedding present
another time after min had already left the handbag factory her younger sister came to visit bringing two coach signature handbags as gifts
i looked in the zippered pocket of one and i found a printed card in english which read an american classic
in the burnished patina of an all american baseball glove inspired the founder of coach to create a new collection of handbags from the same luxuriously soft gloved hand leather
six skilled leatherworkers crafted signature handbags with perfect proportions and a timeless flair
they were fresh functional and women everywhere adored them a new american classic was born
i wonder what karl marx would have made of min and her sisters
their relationship with the product of their labor was more complicated surprising and funny than he could have imagined
and yet his view of the world persists and our tendency to see the workers as faceless masses to imagine that we can know what theyre really thinking
the first time i met min she had just turned and quit her first job on the assembly line of an electronics factory
over the next two years i watched as she switched jobs five times eventually landing a lucrative post in the purchasing department of a hardware factory
later she married a fellow migrant worker moved with him to his village gave birth to two daughters and saved enough money to buy a secondhand buick for herself and an apartment for her parents
she recently returned to dongguan on her own to take a job in a factory that makes construction cranes temporarily leaving her husband and children back in the village
in a recent email to me she explained a person should have some ambition while she is young so that in old age she can look back on her life and feel that it was not lived to no purpose
across china there are million workers like her one third of them women who have left their villages to work in the factories the hotels the restaurants and the construction sites of the big cities
together they make up the largest migration in history and it is globalization this chain that begins in a chinese farming village and ends with iphones in our pockets and nikes on our feet and coach handbags on our arms that has changed the way these millions of people work and marry and live and think
very few of them would want to go back to the way things used to be
when i first went to dongguan i worried that it would be depressing to spend so much time with workers
i also worried that nothing would ever happen to them or that they would have nothing to say to me
instead i found young women who were smart and funny and brave and generous
by opening up their lives to me they taught me so much about factories and about china and about how to live in the world
this is the coach purse that min gave me on the train home to visit her family
i keep it with me to remind me of the ties that tie me to the young women i wrote about ties that are not economic but personal in nature measured not in money but in memories
this purse is also a reminder that the things that you imagine sitting in your office or in the library are not how you find them when you actually go out into the world
thank you
chris anderson thank you leslie that was an insight that a lot of us havent had before
but im curious if you had a minute say with apples head of manufacturing what would you say
leslie chang one minute
ca one minute
lc you know what really impressed me about the workers is how much theyre self motivated self driven resourceful and the thing that struck me what they want most is education to learn because most of them come from very poor backgrounds
they usually left school when they were in or grade
their parents are often illiterate and then they come to the city and they on their own at night during the weekends theyll take a computer class theyll take an english class and learn really really rudimentary things you know like how to type a document in word or how to say really simple things in english
so if you really want to help these workers start these small very focused very pragmatic classes in these schools and whats going to happen is all your workers are going to move on but hopefully theyll move on into higher jobs within apple and you can help their social mobility and their self improvement
when you talk to workers thats what they want
they do not say i want better hot water in the showers
i want a nicer room i want a tv set
i mean it would be nice to have those things but thats not why theyre in the city and thats not what they care about
ca was there a sense from them of a narrative that things were kind of tough and bad or was there a narrative of some kind of level of growth that things over time were getting better
lc oh definitely definitely i mean you know it was interesting because i spent basically two years hanging out in this city dongguan and over that time you could see immense change in every persons life upward downward sideways but generally upward
if you spend enough time its upward and i met people who had moved to the city years ago and who are now basically urban middle class people so the trajectory is definitely upward
its just hard to see when youre suddenly sucked into the city it looks like everyones poor and desperate but thats not really how it is
certainly the factory conditions are really tough and its nothing you or i would want to do but from their perspective where theyre coming from is much worse and where theyre going is hopefully much better and i just wanted to give that context of whats going on in their minds not what necessarily is going on in yours
ca thanks so much for your talk
thank you very much

title neil macgregor years of history in one object title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript a clay cylinder covered in akkadian cuneiform script damaged and broken the cyrus cylinder is a powerful symbol of religious tolerance and multi culturalism in this enthralling talk neil macgregor director of the british museum traces years of middle eastern history through this single object description
the things we make have one supreme quality they live longer than us
we perish they survive we have one life they have many lives and in each life they can mean different things
which means that while we all have one biography they have many
i want this morning to talk about the story the biography or rather the biographies of one particular object one remarkable thing
it doesnt i agree look very much
its about the size of a rugby ball
its made of clay and its been fashioned into a cylinder shape covered with close writing and then baked dry in the sun
and as you can see its been knocked about a bit which is not surprising because it was made two and a half thousand years ago and was dug up in
but today this thing is i believe a major player in the politics of the middle east
and its an object with fascinating stories and stories that are by no means over yet
the story begins in the iran iraq war and that series of events that culminated in the invasion of iraq by foreign forces the removal of a despotic ruler and instant regime change
and i want to begin with one episode from that sequence of events that most of you would be very familiar with belshazzars feast because were talking about the iran iraq war of bc
and the parallels between the events of bc and and in between are startling
what youre looking at is rembrandts painting now in the national gallery in london illustrating the text from the prophet daniel in the hebrew scriptures
and you all know roughly the story
belshazzar the son of nebuchadnezzar nebuchadnezzar whod conquered israel sacked jerusalem and captured the people and taken the jews back to babylon
not only the jews hed taken the temple vessels
hed ransacked desecrated the temple
and the great gold vessels of the temple in jerusalem had been taken to babylon
belshazzar his son decides to have a feast
and in order to make it even more exciting he added a bit of sacrilege to the rest of the fun and he brings out the temple vessels
hes already at war with the iranians with the king of persia
and that night daniel tells us at the height of the festivities a hand appeared and wrote on the wall you are weighed in the balance and found wanting and your kingdom is handed over to the medes and the persians
and that very night cyrus king of the persians entered babylon and the whole regime of belshazzar fell
it is of course a great moment in the history of the jewish people
its a great story its story we all know
the writing on the wall is part of our everyday language
what happened next was remarkable and its where our cylinder enters the story
cyrus king of the persians has entered babylon without a fight the great empire of babylon which ran from central southern iraq to the mediterranean falls to cyrus
and cyrus makes a declaration
and that is what this cylinder is the declaration made by the ruler guided by god who had toppled the iraqi despot and was going to bring freedom to the people
in ringing babylonian it was written in babylonian he says i am cyrus king of all the universe the great king the powerful king king of babylon king of the four quarters of the world
theyre not shy of hyperbole as you can see
this is probably the first real press release by a victorious army that weve got
and its written as well see in due course by very skilled p r consultants
so the hyperbole is not actually surprising
and what is the great king the powerful king the king of the four quarters of the world going to do
he goes on to say that having conquered babylon he will at once let all the peoples that the babylonians nebuchadnezzar and belshazzar have captured and enslaved go free
hell let them return to their countries
and more important he will let them all recover the gods the statues the temple vessels that had been confiscated
all the peoples that the babylonians had repressed and removed will go home and theyll take with them their gods
and theyll be able to restore their altars and to worship their gods in their own way in their own place
this is the decree this object is the evidence for the fact that the jews after the exile in babylon the years theyd spent sitting by the waters of babylon weeping when they remembered jerusalem those jews were allowed to go home
they were allowed to return to jerusalem and to rebuild the temple
its a central document in jewish history
and the book of chronicles the book of ezra in the hebrew scriptures reported in ringing terms
this is the jewish version of the same story
thus said cyrus king of persia all the kingdoms of the earth have the lord god of heaven given thee and he has charged me to build him a house in jerusalem
who is there among you of his people
the lord god be with him and let him go up go up aaleh
the central element still of the notion of return a central part of the life of judaism
as you all know that return from exile the second temple reshaped judaism
and that change that great historic moment was made possible by cyrus the king of persia reported for us in hebrew in scripture and in babylonian in clay
two great texts what about the politics
what was going on was the fundamental shift in middle eastern history
the empire of iran the medes and the persians united under cyrus became the first great world empire
cyrus begins in the bc
and by the time of his son darius the whole of the eastern mediterranean is under persian control
this empire is in fact the middle east as we now know it and its what shapes the middle east as we now know it
it was the largest empire the world had known until then
much more important it was the first multicultural multifaith state on a huge scale
and it had to be run in a quite new way
it had to be run in different languages
the fact that this decree is in babylonian says one thing
and it had to recognize their different habits different peoples different religions different faiths
all of those are respected by cyrus
cyrus sets up a model of how you run a great multinational multifaith multicultural society
and the result of that was an empire that included the areas you see on the screen and which survived for years of stability until it was shattered by alexander
it left a dream of the middle east as a unit and a unit where people of different faiths could live together
the greek invasions ended that
and of course alexander couldnt sustain a government and it fragmented
but what cyrus represented remained absolutely central
the greek historian xenophon wrote his book cyropaedia promoting cyrus as the great ruler
and throughout european culture afterward cyrus remained the model
this is a century image to show you how widespread his veneration actually was
and xenophons book on cyrus on how you ran a diverse society was one of the great textbooks that inspired the founding fathers of the american revolution
jefferson was a great admirer the ideals of cyrus obviously speaking to those century ideals of how you create religious tolerance in a new state
meanwhile back in babylon things had not been going well
after alexander the other empires babylon declines falls into ruins and all the traces of the great babylonian empire are lost until when the cylinder is discovered by a british museum exhibition digging in babylon
and it enters now another story
it enters that great debate in the middle of the century are the scriptures reliable can we trust them
we only knew about the return of the jews and the decree of cyrus from the hebrew scriptures
no other evidence
suddenly this appeared
and great excitement to a world where those who believed in the scriptures had had their faith in creation shaken by evolution by geology here was evidence that the scriptures were historically true
its a great century moment
but and this of course is where it becomes complicated the facts were true hurrah for archeology but the interpretation was rather more complicated
because the cylinder account and the hebrew bible account differ in one key respect
the babylonian cylinder is written by the priests of the great god of bablyon marduk
and not surprisingly they tell you that all this was done by marduk
marduk we hold called cyrus by his name
marduk takes cyrus by the hand calls him to shepherd his people and gives him the rule of babylon
marduk tells cyrus that he will do these great generous things of setting the people free
and this is why we should all be grateful to and worship marduk
the hebrew writers in the old testament you will not be surprised to learn take a rather different view of this
for them of course it cant possibly by marduk that made all this happen
it can only be jehovah
and so in isaiah we have the wonderful texts giving all the credit of this not to marduk but to the lord god of israel the lord god of israel who also called cyrus by name also takes cyrus by the hand and talks of him shepherding his people
its a remarkable example of two different priestly appropriations of the same event two different religious takeovers of a political fact
god we know is usually on the side of the big battalions
the question is which god was it
and the debate unsettles everybody in the century to realize that the hebrew scriptures are part of a much wider world of religion
and its quite clear the cylinder is older than the text of isaiah and yet jehovah is speaking in words very similar to those used by marduk
and theres a slight sense that isaiah knows this because he says this is god speaking of course i have called thee by thy name though thou hast not known me
i think its recognized that cyrus doesnt realize that hes acting under orders from jehovah
and equally hed have been surprised that he was acting under orders from marduk
because interestingly of course cyrus is a good iranian with a totally different set of gods who are not mentioned in any of these texts
thats
years on and were in and the cylinder enters a different world
this time the real politics of the contemporary world the year of the balfour declaration the year when the new imperial power in the middle east britain decides that it will declare a jewish national home it will allow the jews to return
and the response to this by the jewish population in eastern europe is rhapsodic
and across eastern europe jews display pictures of cyrus and of george v side by side the two great rulers who have allowed the return to jerusalem
and the cyrus cylinder comes back into public view and the text of this as a demonstration of why what is going to happen after the war is over in is part of a divine plan
you all know what happened
the state of israel is setup and years later in the late its clear that britains role as the imperial power is over
and another story of the cylinder begins
the region the u k and the u s decide has to be kept safe from communism and the superpower that will be created to do this would be iran the shah
and so the shah invents an iranian history or a return to iranian history that puts him in the center of a great tradition and produces coins showing himself with the cyrus cylinder
when he has his great celebrations in persepolis he summons the cylinder and the cylinder is lent by the british museum goes to tehran and is part of those great celebrations of the pahlavi dynasty
cyrus cylinder guarantor of the shah
years later another story iranian revolution
islamic revolution no more cyrus were not interested in that history were interested in islamic iran until iraq the new superpower that weve all decided should be in the region attacks
then another iran iraq war
and it becomes critical for the iranians to remember their great past their great past when they fought iraq and won
it becomes critical to find a symbol that will pull together all iranians muslims and non muslims christians zoroastrians jews living in iran people who are devout not devout
and the obvious emblem is cyrus
so when the british museum and tehran national musuem cooperate and work together as weve been doing the iranians ask for one thing only as a loan
its the only object they want
they want to borrow the cyrus cylinder
and last year the cyrus cylinder went to tehran for the second time
its shown being presented here put into its case by the director of the national museum of tehran one of the many women in iran in very senior positions mrs ardakani
it was a huge event
this is the other side of that same picture
its seen in tehran by between one and two million people in the space of a few months
this is beyond any blockbuster exhibition in the west
and its the subject of a huge debate about what this cylinder means what cyrus means but above all cyrus as articulated through this cylinder cyrus as the defender of the homeland the champion of course of iranian identity and of the iranian peoples tolerant of all faiths
and in the current iran zoroastrians and christians have guaranteed places in the iranian parliament something to be very very proud of
to see this object in tehran thousands of jews living in iran came to tehran to see it
it became a great emblem a great subject of debate about what iran is at home and abroad
is iran still to be the defender of the oppressed
will iran set free the people that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated
this is heady national rhetoric and it was all put together in a great pageant launching the return
here you see this out sized cyrus cylinder on the stage with great figures from iranian history gathering to take their place in the heritage of iran
it was a narrative presented by the president himself
and for me to take this object to iran to be allowed to take this object to iran was to be allowed to be part of an extraordinary debate led at the highest levels about what iran is what different irans there are and how the different histories of iran might shape the world today
its a debate thats still continuing and it will continue to rumble because this object is one of the great declarations of a human aspiration
it stands with the american constitution
it certainly says far more about real freedoms than magna carta
it is a document that can mean so many things for iran and for the region
a replica of this is at the united nations
in new york this autumn it will be present when the great debates about the future of the middle east take place
and i want to finish by asking you what the next story will be in which this object figures
it will appear certainly in many more middle eastern stories
and what story of the middle east what story of the world do you want to see reflecting what is said what is expressed in this cylinder
the right of peoples to live together in the same state worshiping differently freely a middle east a world in which religion is not the subject of division or of debate
in the world of the middle east at the moment the debates are as you know shrill
but i think its possible that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all of them may well be the voice of this mute thing the cyrus cylinder
thank you

title joshua klein a thought experiment on the intelligence of crows title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript hacker and writer joshua klein is fascinated by crows after a long amateur study of corvid behavior hes come up with an elegant thought experiment a machine that could form a new bond between animal and human description
how many of you have seen the alfred hitchcock film the birds
any of you get really freaked out by that
you might want to leave now
so this is a vending machine for crows
and over the past few days many of you have been asking me how did you come to this how did you get started doing this
and it started as with many great ideas or many ideas you cant get rid of anyway at a cocktail party
about years ago i was at a cocktail party with a friend of mine and were sitting there and he was complaining about the crows that he had seen that were all over his yard and making a big mess
and he was telling me that really we ought to try and eradicate these things
we gotta kill them because theyre making a mess
i said that was stupid you know maybe we should just train them to do something useful
and he said that was impossible
and im sure im in good company in finding that tremendously annoying when someone tells you its impossible
so i spent the next years reading about crows in my spare time
and after years of this my wife eventually said look you know you gotta do this thing youve been talking about and build the vending machine
so i did
but part of the reason that i found this interesting is that i started noticing that we are very aware of all the species that are going extinct on the planet as a result of human habitation expansion and no one seems to be paying attention to all the species that are actually living that are surviving
and im talking specifically about synanthropic species which are species that have adapted specifically for human ecologies species like rats and cockroaches and crows
and as i started looking at them i was finding that they had hyper adapted
theyd become extremely adept at living with us
and in return we just tried to kill them all the time
and in doing so we were breeding them for parasitism
we were giving them all sorts of reasons to adapt new ways
so for example rats are incredibly responsive breeders
and cockroaches as anyone whos tried to get rid of them knows have become really immune to the poisons that were using
so i thought lets build something thats mutually beneficial
well then lets build something that we can both benefit from and find some way to make a new relationship with these species
and so i built the vending machine
but the story of the vending machine is a little more interesting if you know more about crows
it turns out that crows arent just surviving with human beings theyre actually really thriving
theyre found everywhere on the planet except for the arctic and the southern tip of south america
and in all that area theyre only rarely found breeding more than five kilometers away from human beings
so we may not think about them but theyre always around
and not surprisingly given the human population growth more than half of the human population is living in cities now
and out of those nine tenths of the human growth population is occurring in cities
were seeing a population boom with crows
so bird counts are indicating that we might be seeing up to exponential growth in their numbers
so thats no great surprise
but what was really interesting to me was to find out that the birds were adapting in a pretty unusual way
and ill give you an example of that
so this is betty shes a new caledonian crow
and these crows use sticks in the wild to get insects and whatnot out of pieces of wood
here shes trying to get a piece of meat out of a tube
but the researchers had a problem
they messed up and left just a stick of wire in there
and she hadnt had the opportunity to do this before
you see it wasnt working very well
so she adapted
now this is completely unprompted she had never seen this done before
no one taught her to bend this into a hook had shown her how it could happen
but she did it all on her own
so keep in mind that shes never seen this done
right
yeah all right
thats the part where the researchers freak out
so it turns out weve been finding more and more that crows are really really intelligent
their brains are proportionate in the same proportion as chimpanzee brains are
there are all kinds of anecdotes for different kinds of intelligence they have
for example in sweden crows will wait for fishermen to drop lines through holes in the ice
and when the fishermen move off the crows fly down reel up the lines and eat the fish or the bait
its pretty annoying for the fishermen
on an entirely different tack at university of washington they a few years ago were doing an experiment where they captured some crows on campus
some students went out and netted some crows brought them in and were weighed them and measured them and whatnot and then let them back out again
and were entertained to discover that for the rest of the week these crows whenever these particular students walked around campus these crows would caw at them and run around and make their life kind of miserable
they were significantly less entertained when this went on for the next week
and the next month and after summer break
until they finally graduated and left campus and glad to get away im sure came back sometime later and found the crows still remembered them
so the moral being dont piss off crows
so now students at the university of washington that are studying these crows do so with a giant wig and a big mask
its fairly interesting
so we know that these crows are really smart but the more i dug into this the more i found that they actually have an even more significant adaptation
video crows have become highly skilled at making a living in these new urban environments
in this japanese city they have devised a way of eating a food that normally they cant manage drop it among the traffic
the problem now is collecting the bits without getting run over
wait for the light to stop the traffic
then collect your cracked nut in safety
joshua klein yeah yeah pretty interesting
so whats significant about this isnt that crows are using cars to crack nuts
in fact thats old hat for crows
this happened about years ago in a place called sendai city at a driving school in the suburbs of tokyo
and since that time all of the crows in the neighborhood are picking up this behavior
and now every crow within five kilometers is standing by a sidewalk waiting to collect its lunch
so theyre learning from each other and research bears this out
parents seem to be teaching their young
theyve learned from their peers theyve learned from their enemies
if i have a little extra time ill tell you about a case of crow infidelity that illustrates that nicely
the point being that theyve developed cultural adaptation
and as we heard yesterday thats the pandoras box thats getting human beings in trouble and were starting to see it with them
theyre able to very quickly and very flexibly adapt to new challenges and new resources in their environment which is really useful if you live in a city
so we know that theres lots of crows
we found out theyre really smart and we found out that they can teach each other
and when all this became clear to me i realized the only obvious thing to do is build a vending machine
so thats what we did
this is a vending machine for crows
and it uses skinnerian training to shape their behavior over four stages
its pretty simple
basically what happens is that we put this out in a field or someplace where theres lots of crows and we put coins and peanuts all around the base of the machine
and crows eventually come by and eat the peanuts and get used to the machine being there
and eventually they eat up all the peanuts
and then they see that there are peanuts here on the feeder tray and they hop up and help themselves
and then they leave and the machine spits up more coins and peanuts and life is really dandy if youre a crow
then you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut
so when they get really used to that we move on to the crows coming back
now theyre used to the sound of the machine and they keep coming back and digging out these peanuts from amongst the pile of coins thats there
and when they get really happy about this we go ahead and stymie them
and we move to the third stage where we only give them a coin
now like most of us who have gotten used to a good thing this really pisses them off
so they do what they do in nature when theyre looking for something they sweep things out of the way with their beak
and they do that here and that knocks the coins down the slot and when that happens they get a peanut
and so this goes on for some time
the crows learn that all they have to do is show up wait for the coin to come out put the coin in the slot and then they get their peanut
and when theyre really good and comfortable with that we move to the final stage in which they show up and nothing happens
and this is where we see the difference between crows and other animals
squirrels for example would show up look for the peanut go away
come back look for the peanut go away
they do this maybe half a dozen times before they get bored and then they go off and play in traffic
crows on the other hand show up and they try and figure it out
they know that this machines been messing with them through three different stages of behavior
they figure its gotta have more to it
so they poke at it and peck at it and whatnot
and eventually some crow gets a bright idea that hey theres lots of coins lying around from the first stage lying around on the ground hops down picks it up drops it in the slot
and then were off to the races
that crow enjoys a temporary monopoly on peanuts until his friends figure out how to do it and then there we go
so whats significant about this to me isnt that we can train crows to pick up peanuts
mind you theres million dollars worth of change lost every year but im not sure i can depend on that roi from crows
instead i think we should look a little bit larger
i think that crows can be trained to do other things
for example why not train them to pick up garbage after stadium events
or find expensive components from discarded electronics
or maybe do search and rescue
the main thing the main point of all this for me is that we can find mutually beneficial systems for these species
we can find ways to interact with these other species that doesnt involve exterminating them but involves finding an equilibrium with them thats a useful balance
thanks very much

title david logan tribal leadership title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript david logan talks about the five kinds of tribes that humans naturally form in schools workplaces even the drivers license bureau by understanding our shared tribal tendencies we can help lead each other to become better individuals description
what were really here to talk about is the how
okay so how exactly do we create this world shattering if you will innovation
now i want to tell you a quick story
well go back a little more than a year
in fact the date im curious to know if any of you know what happened on this momentous date
it was february
anyone remember what happened february
super bowl i heard it over here it was the date of the super bowl
and the reason that this date was so momentous is that what my colleagues john king and halee fischer wright and i noticed as we began to debrief various super bowl parties is that it seemed to us that across the united states if you will tribal councils had convened
and they had discussed things of great national importance
like do we like the budweiser commercial
and do we like the nachos and who is going to win
but they also talked about which candidate they were going to support
and if you go back in time to february it looked like hilary clinton was going to get the democratic nomination
and there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way
but when we talked to people it appeared that a funnel effect had happened in these tribes all across the united states
now what is a tribe a tribe is a group of about so kind of more than a team to about people
and its within these tribes that all of our work gets done
but not just work its within these tribes that societies get built that important things happen
and so as we surveyed the if you will representatives from various tribal councils that met also known as super bowl parties we sent the following email off to newspaper editors the following day
february we posted it on our website this was before super tuesday
we said the tribes that were in are saying its going to be obama
now the reason we knew that was because we spent the previous years studying tribes studying these naturally occurring groups
all of you are members of tribes
in walking around at the break many of you had met members of your tribe and you were talking to them
and many of you were doing what great if you will tribal leaders do which is to find someone who is a member of a tribe and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe and make introductions
that is in fact what great tribal leaders do
so here is the bottom line
if you focus in on a group like this this happens to be a usc game and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors so you could see individual people you would in fact see not a single crowd just like there is not a single crowd here but you would see these tribes that are then coming together
and from a distance it appears that its a single group
and so people form tribes
they always have they always will
just as fish swim and birds fly people form tribes its just what we do
but heres the rub
not all tribes are the same and what makes the difference is the culture
now here is the net out of this
youre all a member of tribes
if you can find a way to take the tribes that youre in and nudge them forward along these tribal stages to what we call stage five which is the top of the mountain
but were going to start with what we call stage one
now this is the lowest of the stages
you dont want this okay
this is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen
but its one that i think we need to learn from
stage one produces people who do horrible things
this is the kid who shot up virginia tech
stage one is a group where people systematically sever relationships from functional tribes and then pool together with people who think like they do
stage one is literally the culture of gangs and it is the culture of prisons
now again we dont often deal with stage one
and i want to make the point that as members of society we need to
its not enough to simply write people off
but lets move on to stage two
now stage one youll notice says in effect life sucks
so this other book that steve mentioned that just came out called the three laws of performance my colleague steve zaffron and i argue that as people see the world so they behave
well if people see the world in such a way that life sucks then their behavior will follow automatically from that
it will be despairing hostility
theyll do whatever it takes to survive even if that means undermining other people
now my birthday is coming up shortly and my drivers license expires
and the reason that thats relevant is that very soon i will be walking into what we call a stage two tribe which looks like this
now am i saying that in every department of motor vehicles across the land you find a stage two culture
no but in the one near me where i have to go in just a few days what i will say when im standing in line is how can people be so dumb and yet live
now am i saying that there are dumb people working here
actually no im not
but im saying the culture makes people dumb
so in a stage two culture and we find these in all sorts of different places you find them in fact in the best organizations in the world
you find them in all places in society
ive come across them at the organizations that everybody raves about as being best in class
but here is the point if you believe and you say to people in your tribe in effect my life sucks
i mean if i got to go to tedx usc my life wouldnt suck but i dont so it does
if thats how you talked imagine what kind of work would get done
what kind of innovation would get done
the amount of world changing behavior that would happen
in fact it would be basically nil
now when we go on to stage three this is the one that hits closest to home for many of us
because it is in stage three that many of us move
and we park and we stay
stage three says im great and youre not
im great and youre not
now imagine having a whole room of people saying in effect im great and youre not
or im going to find some way to compete with you and come out on top as a result of that
a whole group of people communicating that way talking that way
i know this sounds like a joke three doctors walk into a bar
but in this case three doctors walk into an elevator
i happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book
and one doctor said to the others did you see my article in the new england journal of medicine
and the other said no thats great congratulations
the next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said well while you were you know doing your research notice the condescending tone while you were off doing your research i was off doing more surgeries than anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution
and the third one got the same wry smile and said well while you were off doing your research and you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery that eventually well train monkeys to do or cells or robots or maybe not even need to do it at all i was off running the future of the residency program which is really the future of medicine
and they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back
and the elevator door opened and they all walked out
that is a meeting of a stage three tribe
now we find these in places where really smart successful people show up
like oh i dont know tedx usc
here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation
it is moving from stage three to stage four
lets take a look at a quick video snippet
this is from a company called zappos located outside las vegas
and my question on the other side is just going to be what do you think they value
it was not christmas time there was a christmas tree
this is their lobby
employees volunteer time in the advice booth
notice it looks like something out of a peanuts cartoon
okay were going through the hallway here at zappos
this is a call center notice how its decorated
notice people are applauding for us
they dont know who we are and they dont care and if they did they probably wouldnt applaud
but youll notice the level of excitement
notice again how they decorate their office
now whats important to people at zappos these may not be the things that are important to you
but they value things like fun and they value creativity
one of their stated values is be a little bit weird
and youll notice they are a little bit weird
so when individuals come together and find something that unites them thats greater than their individual competence then something very important happens
the group gels and it changes from a group of highly motivated but fairly individually centric people into something larger into a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence
stage four tribes can do remarkable things
but youll notice were not at the top of the mountain yet
there is in fact another stage
now some of you may not recognize the scene thats up here
and if you take a look at the headline of stage five which is life is great this may seem a little incongruous
this is a scene or snippet from the truth and reconciliation process in south africa for which desmond tutu won the nobel prize
now think about that south africa terrible atrocities had happened in the society
and people came together focused only on those two values truth and reconciliation
there was no road map no one had ever done anything like this before
and in this atmosphere where the only guidance was peoples values and their noble cause what this group accomplished was historic
and people at the time feared that south africa would end up going the way that rwanda has gone descending into one skirmish after another in a civil war that seems to have no end
in fact south africa has not gone down that road
largely because people like desmond tutu set up a stage five process to involve the thousands and perhaps millions of tribes in the country to bring everyone together
so people hear this and they conclude the following as did we in doing the study
okay got it i dont want to talk stage one
thats like you know life sucks who wants to talk that way
i dont want to talk like they do at the particular dmv thats close to where dave lives
i really dont want to just say im great because that kind of sounds narcissistic and then i wont have any friends
saying were great that sounds pretty good
but i should really talk stage five right life is great
well in fact there are three somewhat counter intuitive findings that come out of all this
the first one if you look at the declaration of independence and actually read it the phrase that sticks in many of our minds is things about inalienable rights
i mean thats stage five right life is great oriented only by our values no other guidance
in fact most of the document is written at stage two
my life sucks because i live under a tyrant also known as king george
were great who is not great england
sorry
well what about other great leaders what about gandhi
what about martin luther king
i mean surely these were just people who preached life is great right
just one little bit of happiness and joy after another
in fact martin luther kings most famous line was at stage three
he didnt say we have a dream he said i have a dream
why did he do that because most people are not at stage five
two percent are at stage one
about percent are at stage two saying in effect my life sucks
percent of working tribes say these are employed tribes say im great and youre not
and we have to duke it out every day so we resort to politics
only about percent of tribes are at stage four oriented by our values saying were great
and our values are beginning to unite us
only two percent only two percent of tribes get to stage five
and those are the ones that change the world
so the first little finding from this is that leaders need to be able to talk all the levels so that you can touch every person in society
but you dont leave them where you found them okay
tribes can only hear one level above and below where they are
so we have to have the ability to talk all the levels to go to where they are
and then leaders nudge people within their tribes to the next level
id like to show you some examples of this
one of the people we interviewed was frank jordan former mayor of san francisco before that he was chief of police in san francisco
and he grew up essentially in stage one
and you know what changed his life it was walking into one of these a boys and girls club
now here is what happened to this person who eventually became mayor of san francisco
he went from being alive and passionate at stage one remember life sucks despairing hostility i will do whatever it takes to survive to walking into a boys and girls club folding his arms sitting down in a chair and saying wow my life really sucks
i dont know anybody
i mean if i was into boxing like they were then my life wouldnt suck but i dont so it does
so im going to sit here in my chair and not do anything
in fact thats progress
we move people from stage one to stage two by getting them in a new tribe and then over time getting them connected
so what about moving from stage three to stage four
i want to argue that were doing that right here
ted represents a set of values and as we unite around these values something really interesting begins to emerge
if you want this experience to live on as something historic then at the reception tonight id like to encourage you to do something beyond what people normally do and call networking
which is not just to meet new people and extend your reach extend your influence but instead find someone you dont know and find someone else you dont know and introduce them
thats called a triadic relationship
see people who build world changing tribes do that
they extend the reach of their tribes by connecting them not just to myself so that my following is greater but i connect people who dont know each other to something greater than themselves
and ultimately that adds to their values
but were not done yet because then how do we go from stage four which is great to stage five
the story that i like to end with is this it comes out of a place called the gallup organization
you know they do polls right
so its stage four were great who is not great
pretty much everybody else who does polls
if gallup releases a poll on the same day that nbc releases a poll people will pay attention to the gallup poll okay we understand that
so they were bored
they wanted to change the world so here is the question someone asked
how could we instead of just polling what asia thinks or what the united states thinks or who thinks what about obama versus mccain or something like that what does the entire world think
and they found a way to do the first ever world poll
they had people involved who were nobel laureates in economics who reported being bored
and suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper and were trying to figure out how do we survey the population of sub saharan africa
how do we survey populations that dont have access to technology and speak languages we dont speak and we dont know anyone who speaks those languages because in order to achieve on this great mission we have to be able to do it
incidentally they did pull it off
and they released the first ever world poll
so id like to leave you with these thoughts
first of all we all form tribes all of us
youre in tribes here hopefully youre extending the reach of the tribes that you have
but the question on the table is this what kind of an impact are the tribes that you are in making
youre hearing one presentation after another often representing a group of people a tribe about how they have changed the world
if you do what weve talked about you listen for how people actually communicate in the tribes that youre in
and you dont leave them where they are you nudge them forward
you remember to talk all five culture stages
because weve got people in all five around us
and the question that id like to leave you with is this will your tribes change the world
thank you very much

title frederick balagadde bio lab on a microchip title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript drugs alone cant stop disease in sub saharan africa we need diagnostic tools to match ted senior fellow frederick balagadde shows how we can multiply the power and availability of an unwieldy expensive diagnostic lab by miniaturizing it to the size of a chip description
the greatest irony in global health is that the poorest countries carry the largest disease burden
if we resize the countries of the globe in proportion to the subject of interest we see that sub saharan africa is the worst hit region by hiv aids
this is the most devastating epidemic of our time
we also see that this region has the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease
there are very few doctors and quite frankly these countries do not have the resources that are needed to cope with such epidemics
so what the western countries developed countries have generously done is they have proposed to provide free drugs to all people in third world countries who actually cant afford these medications
and this has already saved millions of lives and it has prevented entire economies from capsizing in sub saharan africa
but there is a fundamental problem that is killing the efforts in fighting this disease because if you keep throwing drugs out at people who dont have diagnostic services you end up creating a problem of drug resistance
this is already beginning to happen in sub saharan africa
the problem is that what begins as a tragedy in the third world could easily become a global problem
and the last thing we want to see is drug resistant strains of hiv popping up all over the world because it will make treatment more expensive and it could also restore the pre arv carnage of hiv aids
i experienced this firsthand as a high school student in uganda
this was in the during the peak of the hiv epidemic before there were any arvs in sub saharan africa
and during that time i actually lost more relatives as well as the teachers who taught me to hiv aids
so this became one of the driving passions of my life to help find real solutions that could address these kinds of problems
we all know about the miracle of miniaturization
back in the day computers used to fill this entire room and people actually used to work inside the computers
but what electronic miniaturization has done is that it has allowed people to shrink technology into a cell phone
and im sure everyone here enjoys cell phones that can actually be used in the remote areas of the world in the third world countries
the good news is that the same technology that allowed miniaturization of electronics is now allowing us to miniaturize biological laboratories
so right now we can actually miniaturize biological and chemistry laboratories onto microfluidic chips
i was very lucky to come to the us right after high school and was able to work on this technology and develop some devices
this is a microfluidic chip that i developed
a close look at how the technology works these are channels that are about the size of a human hair so you have integrated valves pumps mixers and injectors so you can fit entire diagnostic experiments onto a microfluidic system
so what i plan to do with this technology is to actually take the current state of the technology and build an hiv kit in a microfluidic system
so with one microfluidic chip which is the size of an iphone you can actually diagnose patients at the same time
for each patient we will be able to do up to different viral loads per patient
and this is only done in four hours times faster than the current state of the art at a cost that will be five to times cheaper than the current options
so this will allow us to create personalized medicines in the third world at a cost that is actually achievable and make the world a safer place
i invite your interest as well as your involvement in driving this vision to a point of practical reality
thank you very much

title jonathan drori the beautiful tricks of flowers title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript in this visually dazzling talk jonathan drori shows the extraordinary ways flowering plants over a quarter million species have evolved to attract insects to spread their pollen growing landing strips to guide the insects in shining in ultraviolet building elaborate traps and even mimicking other insects in heat description
do you know how many species of flowering plants there are
there are a quarter of a million at least those are the ones we know about a quarter of a million species of flowering plants
and flowers are a real bugger
theyre really difficult for plants to produce
they take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources
why would they go to that bother
and the answer of course like so many things in the world is sex
i know whats on your mind when youre looking at these pictures
and the reason that sexual reproduction is so important there are lots of other things that plants can do to reproduce
you can take cuttings they can sort of have sex with themselves they can pollinate themselves
but they really need to spread their genes to mix with other genes so that they can adapt to environmental niches
evolution works that way
now the way that plants transmit that information is through pollen
some of you may have seen some of these pictures before
as i say every home should have a scanning electron microscope to be able to see these
and there is as many different kinds of pollen as there are flowering plants
and thats actually rather useful for forensics and so on
most pollen that causes hay fever for us is from plants that use the wind to disseminate the pollen and thats a very inefficient process which is why it gets up our noses so much
because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it hoping that your sex cells your male sex cells which are held within the pollen will somehow reach another flower just by chance
so all the grasses which means all of the cereal crops and most of the trees have wind borne pollen
but most species actually use insects to do their bidding and thats more intelligent in a way because the pollen they dont need so much of it
the insects and other species can take the pollen transfer it directly to where its required
so were aware obviously of the relationship between insects and plants
theres a symbiotic relationship there whether its flies or birds or bees theyre getting something in return and that something in return is generally nectar
sometimes that symbiosis has led to wonderful adaptations the hummingbird hawk moth is beautiful in its adaptation
the plant gets something and the hawk moth spreads the pollen somewhere else
plants have evolved to create little landing strips here and there for bees that might have lost their way
there are markings on many plants that look like other insects
these are the anthers of a lily cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with
and theres an orchid that might look to you as if its got jaws and in a way it has it forces the insect to crawl out getting covered in pollen that it takes somewhere else
orchids there are at least species of orchids amazingly amazingly diverse
and they get up to all sorts of tricks
they have to try and attract pollinators to do their bidding
this orchid known as darwins orchid because its one that he studied and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it you can see that theres a very long nectar tube that descends down from the orchid
and basically what the insect has to do were in the middle of the flower it has to stick its little proboscis right into the middle of that and all the way down that nectar tube to get to the nectar
and darwin said looking at this flower i guess something has coevolved with this
and sure enough theres the insect
and i mean normally it kind of rolls it away but in its erect form thats what it looks like
now you can imagine that if nectar is such a valuable thing and expensive for the plant to produce and it attracts lots of pollinators then just as in human sex people might start to deceive
they might say ive got a bit of nectar do you want to come and get it
now this is a plant
this is a plant here that insects in south africa just love and theyve evolved with a long proboscis to get the nectar at the bottom
and this is the mimic
so this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant
and here is the long probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic because the mimic doesnt give it any nectar it thought it would get some
so not only has the fly not got the nectar from the mimic plant its also if you look very closely just at the head end you can see that its got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant if only some botanist hadnt come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card
now deceit carries on through the plant kingdom
this flower with its black dots they might look like black dots to us but if i tell you to a male insect of the right species that looks like two females who are really really hot to trot
and when the insect gets there and lands on it dousing itself in pollen of course that its going to take to another plant if you look at the every home should have one scanning electron microscope picture you can see that there are actually some patterning there which is three dimensional
so it probably even feels good for the insect as well as looking good
and these electron microscope pictures heres one of an orchid mimicking an insect you can see that different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures to our eye have very very different textures to what an insect might perceive
and this one is evolved to mimic a glossy metallic surface you see on some beetles
and under the scanning electron microscope you can see the surface there really quite different from the other surfaces we looked at
sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect even to us
i mean i think that looks like some sort of flying animal or beast
its a wonderful amazing thing
this ones clever its called obsidian
i think of it as insidium sometimes
to the right species of bee this looks like another very aggressive bee and it goes and bonks it on the head lots and lots of times to try and drive it away and of course covers itself with pollen
the other thing it does is that this plant mimics another orchid that has a wonderful store of food for insects
and this one doesnt have anything for them
so its deceiving on two levels fabulous
here we see ylang ylang the component of many perfumes
i actually smelt someone with some on earlier
and the flowers dont really have to be that gaudy
theyre sending out a fantastic array of scent to any insect thatll have it
this one doesnt smell so good
this is a flower that really really smells pretty nasty and is designed again evolved to look like carrion
so flies love this
they fly in and they pollinate
this which is helicodiceros is also known as dead horse arum
i dont know what a dead horse actually smells like but this one probably smells pretty much like it
its really horrible
and blowflies just cant help themselves
they fly into this thing and they fly all the way down it
they lay their eggs in it thinking its a nice bit of carrion and not realizing that theres no food for the eggs that the eggs are going to die but the plant meanwhile has benefited because the bristles release and the flies disappear to pollinate the next flower fantastic
heres arum arum maculatum lords and ladies or cuckoo pint in this country
i photographed this thing last week in dorset
this thing heats up by about degrees above ambient temperature amazing
and if you look down into it theres this sort of dam past the spadix flies get attracted by the heat which is boiling off volatile chemicals little midges and they get trapped underneath in this container
they drink this fabulous nectar and then theyre all a bit sticky
at night they get covered in pollen which showers down over them and then the bristles that we saw above they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out covered in pollen fabulous thing
now if you think thats fabulous this is one of my great favorites
this is the philodendron selloum
for anyone here from brazil youll know about this plant
this is the most amazing thing
that sort of phallic bit there is about a foot long
and it does something that no other plant that i know of does and that is that when it flowers thats the spadix in the middle there for a period of about two days it metabolizes in a way which is rather similar to mammals
so instead of having starch which is the food of plants it takes something rather similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate that its burning fat metabolizing about the rate of a small cat
and thats twice the energy output weight for weight than a hummingbird absolutely astonishing
this thing does something else which is unusual
not only will it raise itself to fahrenheit or degrees centigrade for two days but it keeps constant temperature
theres a thermoregulation mechanism in there that keeps constant temperature
now why does it do this i hear you ask
now wouldnt you know it theres some beetles that just love to make love at that temperature
and they get inside and they get it all on
and the plant showers them with pollen and off they go and pollinate
and what a wonderful thing it is
now most pollinators that we think about are insects but actually in the tropics many birds and butterflies pollinate
and many of the tropical flowers are red and thats because butterflies and birds see similarly to us we think and can see the color red very well
but if you look at the spectrum birds and us we see red green and blue and see that spectrum
insects see green blue and ultraviolet and they see various shades of ultraviolet
so theres something that goes on off the end there
and wouldnt it be great if we could somehow see what that is i hear you ask
well yes we can
so what is an insect seeing
last week i took these pictures of rock rose helianthemum in dorset
these are little yellow flowers like we all see little yellow flowers all over the place
and this is what it looks like with visible light
this is what it looks like if you take out the red
most bees dont perceive red
and then i put some ultraviolet filters on my camera and took a very very long exposure with the particular frequencies of ultraviolet light and this is what i got
and thats a real fantastic bulls eye
now we dont know exactly what a bee sees any more than you know what im seeing when i call this red
we cant know whats going on in let alone an insects another human beings mind
but the contrast will look something like that so standing out a lot from the background
heres another little flower different range of ultraviolet frequencies different filters to match the pollinators
and thats the sort of thing that it would be seeing
just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property no flower was damaged in the process of this shot it was just attached to the tripod not killed then under ultraviolet light look at that
and that could be the basis of a sunscreen because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light
so maybe the chemical in that would be useful
finally theres one of evening primrose that bjorn rorslett from norway sent me fantastic hidden pattern
and i love the idea of something hidden
i think theres something poetic here that these pictures taken with ultraviolet filter the main use of that filter is for astronomers to take pictures of venus actually the clouds of venus
thats the main use of that filter
venus of course is the god of love and fertility which is the flower story
and just as flowers spend a lot of effort trying to get pollinators to do their bidding theyve also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them and give them to each other at times of birth and death and particularly at marriage which when you think of it is the moment that encapsulates the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another
thank you very much

title young ha kim be an artist right now title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript why do we ever stop playing and creating with charm and humor celebrated korean author young ha kim invokes the worlds greatest artists to urge you to unleash your inner child the artist who wanted to play forever description
the theme of my talk today is be an artist right now
most people when this subject is brought up get tense and resist it art doesnt feed me and right now im busy
i have to go to school get a job send my kids to lessons you think im too busy i dont have time for art
there are hundreds of reasons why we cant be artists right now
dont they just pop into your head
there are so many reasons why we cant be indeed were not sure why we should be
we dont know why we should be artists but we have many reasons why we cant be
why do people instantly resist the idea of associating themselves with art
perhaps you think art is for the greatly gifted or for the thoroughly and professionally trained
and some of you may think youve strayed too far from art
well you might have but i dont think so
this is the theme of my talk today
we are all born artists
if you have kids you know what i mean
almost everything kids do is art
they draw with crayons on the wall
they dance to son dam bis dance on tv but you cant even call it son dam bis dance it becomes the kids own dance
so they dance a strange dance and inflict their singing on everyone
perhaps their art is something only their parents can bear and because they practice such art all day long people honestly get a little tired around kids
kids will sometimes perform monodramas playing house is indeed a monodrama or a play
and some kids when they get a bit older start to lie
usually parents remember the very first time their kid lies
theyre shocked
now youre showing your true colors mom says she thinks why does he take after his dad
she questions him what kind of a person are you going to be
but you shouldnt worry
the moment kids start to lie is the moment storytelling begins
they are talking about things they didnt see
its amazing its a wonderful moment
parents should celebrate
hurray my boy finally started to lie
all right it calls for celebration
for example a kid says mom guess what i met an alien on my way home
then a typical mom responds stop that nonsense
now an ideal parent is someone who responds like this really an alien huh what did it look like did it say anything
where did you meet it um in front of the supermarket
when you have a conversation like this the kid has to come up with the next thing to say to be responsible for what he started
soon a story develops
of course this is an infantile story but thinking up one sentence after the next is the same thing a professional writer like me does
in essence they are not different
roland barthes once said of flauberts novels flaubert did not write a novel
he merely connected one sentence after another
the eros between sentences that is the essence of flauberts novel
thats right a novel basically is writing one sentence then without violating the scope of the first one writing the next sentence
and you continue to make connections
take a look at this sentence one morning as gregor samsa was waking up from anxious dreams he discovered that in his bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug
yes its the first sentence of franz kafkas the metamorphosis
writing such an unjustifiable sentence and continuing in order to justify it kafkas work became the masterpiece of contemporary literature
kafka did not show his work to his father
he was not on good terms with his father
on his own he wrote these sentences
had he shown his father my boy has finally lost it he wouldve thought
and thats right art is about going a little nuts and justifying the next sentence which is not much different from what a kid does
a kid who has just started to lie is taking the first step as a storyteller
kids do art
they dont get tired and they have fun doing it
i was in jeju island a few days ago
when kids are on the beach most of them love playing in the water
but some of them spend a lot of time in the sand making mountains and seas well not seas but different things people and dogs etc
but parents tell them it will all be washed away by the waves
in other words its useless
theres no need
but kids dont mind
they have fun in the moment and they keep playing in the sand
kids dont do it because someone told them to
they arent told by their boss or anyone they just do it
when you were little i bet you spent time enjoying the pleasure of primitive art
when i ask my students to write about their happiest moment many write about an early artistic experience they had as a kid
learning to play piano for the first time and playing four hands with a friend or performing a ridiculous skit with friends looking like idiots things like that
or the moment you developed the first film you shot with an old camera
they talk about these kinds of experiences
you must have had such a moment
in that moment art makes you happy because its not work
work doesnt make you happy does it mostly its tough
the french writer michel tournier has a famous saying
its a bit mischievous actually
work is against human nature the proof is that it makes us tired
right why would work tire us if its in our nature
playing doesnt tire us
we can play all night long
if we work overnight we should be paid for overtime
why because its tiring and we feel fatigue
but kids usually they do art for fun its playing
they dont draw to sell the work to a client or play the piano to earn money for the family
of course there were kids who had to
you know this gentleman right
he had to tour around europe to support his family wolfgang amadeus mozart but that was centuries ago so we can make him an exception
unfortunately at some point our art such a joyful pastime ends
kids have to go to lessons to school do homework and of course they take piano or ballet lessons but they arent fun anymore
youre told to do it and theres competition how can it be fun
if youre in elementary school and you still draw on the wall youll surely get in trouble with your mom
besides if you continue to act like an artist as you get older youll increasingly feel pressure people will question your actions and ask you to act properly
heres my story i was an eighth grader and i entered a drawing contest at school in gyeongbokgung
i was trying my best and my teacher came around and asked me what are you doing
im drawing diligently i said
why are you using only black
indeed i was eagerly coloring the sketchbook in black
and i explained its a dark night and a crow is perching on a branch
then my teacher said really well young ha you may not be good at drawing but you have a talent for storytelling
or so i wished
now youll get it you rascal was the response
youll get it he said
you were supposed to draw the palace the gyeonghoeru etc but i was coloring everything in black so he dragged me out of the group
there were a lot of girls there as well so i was utterly mortified
none of my explanations or excuses were heard and i really got it big time
if he was an ideal teacher he would have responded like i said before young ha may not have a talent for drawing but he has a gift for making up stories and he would have encouraged me
but such a teacher is seldom found
later i grew up and went to europes galleries i was a university student and i thought this was really unfair
look what i found
works like this were hung in basel while i was punished and stood in front of the palace with my drawing in my mouth
look at this doesnt it look just like wallpaper
contemporary art i later discovered isnt explained by a lame story like mine
no crows are brought up
most of the works have no title untitled
anyways contemporary art in the century is about doing something weird and filling the void with explanation and interpretation essentially the same as i did
of course my work was very amateur but lets turn to more famous examples
this is picassos
he stuck handlebars into a bike seat and called it bulls head sounds convincing right
next a urinal was placed on its side and called fountain
that was duchamp
so filling the gap between explanation and a weird act with stories thats indeed what contemporary art is all about
picasso even made the statement i draw not what i see but what i think
yes it means i didnt have to draw gyeonghoeru
i wish i knew what picasso said back then i could have argued better with my teacher
unfortunately the little artists within us are choked to death before we get to fight against the oppressors of art
they get locked in
thats our tragedy
so what happens when little artists get locked in banished or even killed
our artistic desire doesnt go away
we want to express to reveal ourselves but with the artist dead the artistic desire reveals itself in dark form
in karaoke bars there are always people who sing shes gone or hotel california miming the guitar riffs
usually they sound awful awful indeed
some people turn into rockers like this
or some people dance in clubs
people who would have enjoyed telling stories end up trolling on the internet all night long
thats how a writing talent reveals itself on the dark side
sometimes we see dads get more excited than their kids playing with legos or putting together plastic robots
they go dont touch it daddy will do it for you
the kid has already lost interest and is doing something else but the dad alone builds castles
this shows the artistic impulses inside us are suppressed not gone
but they can often reveal themselves negatively in the form of jealousy
you know the song i would love to be on tv why would we love it
tv is full of people who do what we wished to do but never got to
they dance they act and the more they do they are praised
so we start to envy them
we become dictators with a remote and start to criticize the people on tv
he just cant act you call that singing she cant hit the notes
we easily say these sorts of things
we get jealous not because were evil but because we have little artists pent up inside us
thats what i think
what should we do then
yes thats right
right now we need to start our own art
right this minute we can turn off tv log off the internet get up and start to do something
where i teach students in drama school theres a course called dramatics
in this course all students must put on a play
however acting majors are not supposed to act
they can write the play for example and the writers may work on stage art
likewise stage art majors may become actors and in this way you put on a show
students at first wonder whether they can actually do it but later they have so much fun i rarely see anyone who is miserable doing a play
in school the military or even in a mental institution once you make people do it they enjoy it
i saw this happen in the army many people had fun doing plays
i have another experience in my writing class i give students a special assignment
i have students like you in the class many who dont major in writing
some major in art or music and think they cant write
so i give them blank sheets of paper and a theme
it can be a simple theme write about the most unfortunate experience in your childhood
theres one condition you must write like crazy like crazy
i walk around and encourage them come on come on they have to write like crazy for an hour or two
they only get to think for the first five minutes
the reason i make them write like crazy is because when you write slowly and lots of thoughts cross your mind the artistic devil creeps in
this devil will tell you hundreds of reasons why you cant write people will laugh at you this is not good writing
what kind of sentence is this look at your handwriting
it will say a lot of things
you have to run fast so the devil cant catch up
the really good writing ive seen in my class was not from the assignments with a long deadline but from the to minute crazy writing students did in front of me with a pencil
the students go into a kind of trance
after or minutes they write without knowing what theyre writing
and in this moment the nagging devil disappears
so i can say this its not the hundreds of reasons why one cant be an artist but rather the one reason one must be that makes us artists
why we cannot be something is not important
most artists became artists because of the one reason
when we put the devil in our heart to sleep and start our own art enemies appear on the outside
mostly they have the faces of our parents
sometimes they look like our spouses but they are not your parents or spouses
they are devils devils
they came to earth briefly transformed to stop you from being artistic from becoming artists
and they have a magic question
when we say i think ill try acting theres a drama school in the community center or id like to learn italian songs they ask oh yeah a play what for
the magic question is what for
but art is not for anything
art is the ultimate goal
it saves our souls and makes us live happily
it helps us express ourselves and be happy without the help of alcohol or drugs
so in response to such a pragmatic question we need to be bold
well just for the fun of it sorry for having fun without you is what you should say ill just go ahead and do it anyway
the ideal future i imagine is where we all have multiple identities at least one of which is an artist
once i was in new york and got in a cab i took the backseat and in front of me i saw something related to a play
so i asked the driver what is this
he said it was his profile then what are you i asked an actor he said
he was a cabby and an actor i asked what roles do you usually play
he proudly said he played king lear
king lear
who is it that can tell me who i am a great line from king lear
thats the world i dream of
someone is a golfer by day and writer by night
or a cabby and an actor a banker and a painter secretly or publicly performing their own arts
in martha graham the legend of modern dance came to korea
the great artist then in her arrived at gimpo airport and a reporter asked her a typical question what do you have to do to become a great dancer
any advice for aspiring korean dancers
now she was the master this photo was taken in and she was already a celebrated artist
in she was asked this question
and heres what she answered just do it
wow i was touched
only those three words and she left the airport thats it
so what should we do now
lets be artists right now right away how
just do it
thank you

title sasa vucinic why we should invest in a free press title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript a free press papers magazines radio tv blogs is the backbone of any true democracy sasa vucinic a journalist from belgrade talks about his new fund which supports media by selling free press bonds description
video narrator an event seen from one point of view gives one impression
seen from another point of view it gives quite a different impression
but its only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand whats going on
sasha vucinic its a great clip isnt it
and i found that in seconds it tells more about the power of and importance of independent media than i could say in an hour
so i thought that it will be good to start with it
and also start with a little bit of statistics
according to relevant researchers percent of the population of this planet lives in the societies without independent press
think about that number percent of the population on the whole planet does not really know what is going on in their countries
the information they get gets filtered through somebody who either twists that information or colors that information does something with it
so theyre deprived of understanding their reality
that is just to understand how big and important this problem is
now those of you who are lucky enough to live in those societies that represent percent i think should enjoy it until it lasts
you know sunday morning you flick the paper get your cappuccino
enjoy it while it lasts
because as we heard yesterday countries can lose stars from their flags but they can also lose press freedom as i guess americans among us can tell us more about
but thats totally another and separate topic
so i can go back to my story
my story starts the story i want to share starts in
at that time i was running the only independent for that matter the only electronic media in the country
and i guess we were sharing we had that regular life of the only independent media in the country operating in hostile environment where government really wants to make your life miserable
and there are different ways
yeah it was the usual cocktail a little bit of threats a little bit of friendly advice a little bit of financial police a little bit of text control so you always have somebody who never leaves your office
but what they really do which is very powerful and that is what governments in the late started doing if they dont like independent media companies you know they threaten your advertisers
once they threaten your advertisers market forces are actually you know destroyed and the advertisers do not want to come no matter how much does it make sense for them do not want to come and advertise
and you have a problem making ends meet
at that time at the beginning of the we had that problem which was you know survival below one side but what was really painful for me was remember the beginning of the yugoslavia is falling apart
we were sitting over there with a country in a downfall in a slow motion downfall
and we all had all of that on tapes
we had the ability to understand what was going on
we were actually recording history
the problem was that we had to re tape that history a week later because if we did not we could not afford enough tapes to keep archives of that history
so if i gave you that picture i dont want to go too long on that
in that context a gentleman came to my office at that time
it was still
he was running a media systems organization which is still in business the gentleman is still in business
and what did i know at that time about media systems
i would think media systems were organizations which means they should help you
so i prepared two plans for that meeting two strategic plans the small one and the big one
the small one was i just wanted him to help us get those damn tapes so we can keep that archive for the next years
the big plan was to ask him for a dollar loan
because i thought i still maintain that serious and independent media companies are great business
and i thought that will survive and be a great company once milosevic is gone which turned out to be true
its now probably either the biggest or the second biggest media company in the country
and i thought that the only thing that we needed at that time was dollar loan to take us through those hard times
to make a long story short the gentleman comes into the office great suit and tie
i gave him what i thought was a brilliant explanation of the political situation and explained how hard and difficult the war will be
actually i underestimated the atrocities i have to admit
anyway after that whole big long explanation the only question he had for me and this is not a joke is are we paying royalties after we broadcast music of michael jackson
that was really the only question he had
he left and i remember being actually very angry at myself because i thought there must be an institution in the world that is providing loans to media companies
its so obvious straight in your face and somebody must have thought of it
somebody must have started something like that
and i thought im just dumb and i cannot find it
you know in my defense there was no google at that time you could not just google in
so i thought that thats actually my problem
now we go from here fast forward to
i have i left the country i have a meeting with george soros trying for the third time to convince him that his foundation should invest in something that should operate like a media bank
and basically what i was saying is very simple
you know forget about charity it doesnt work
forget about handouts dollars do not help anybody
what you should do is you should treat media companies as a business
its business anywhere
media business or any other business it needs to be capitalized
and what these guys need actually is access to capital
so third meeting arguments are pretty well exercised
at the end of the meeting he says look it is not going to work you will never see your money back but my foundations will put dollars so you can test the idea
see that it will not work
he said ill give you a rope to hang yourself
i knew two things after that meeting
first under no circumstances i want to hang myself
and second that i have no idea how to make it work
you see at the level of a concept it was a great concept
but its one thing to have a concept its a totally separate thing to actually make it work
so i had absolutely no idea how that could actually work
had the wrong idea i thought that we can be a bank
you see banks i dont know if there are any bankers over here i apologize in advance but its the best job in the world
you know you find somebody who is respectable and has a lot of money
you give them more money they repay you that over a time
you collect interest and do nothing in between
so i thought why dont we get into that business
so here we are having our first client brilliant
first independent newspaper in slovakia
the government cutting them off from all the printing facilities in bratislava
so heres the daily newspaper that has to be printed kilometers away from the capital
its a daily newspaper with a deadline of p m
that means that they have no sports they have no latest news circulation goes down
its a kind of very nice sophisticated way how to economically strangle a daily newspaper
they come to us with a request for a loan
they want to the only way for them to survive is to get a printing press
and we said thats fine lets meet youll bring us your business plan which eventually they did
we start the meeting
i get these two pieces of paper not like this format so its much bigger
a lot of numbers there a lot of numbers
but however you put it you know the numbers do not make any sense
and thats the best they could do
we were the best that they could do
so that is how we understood what our method is
its not a bank we had to actually go into these companies and earn our return by fixing them by establishing management systems by providing all that knowledge how do you run a business on one side while they all know how to run how to create content
just quickly on the results
over these years million dollars in affordable financing average interest rate five percent to six percent
lately we are going wild charging seven percent from time to time
we do it in countries of the developing world
and here is the most stunning number
return rate the one that soros was so worried about percent
percent of all the scheduled repayments came back to us on time
what do we typically finance
we finance anything that a media company would need from printing presses to transmitters
what is most important is we do it either in form of loans equities lease whatever is appropriate for you know supporting anybody
but what is most important here is who do we finance
we believe that in the last years companies that weve financed are actually the best media companies in the developing world
that is a who is who list
and i could spend hours talking about them because theyre all kind of heroes
and i can but ill give you just maybe one and depending on time i may give you two examples who we work with
you see we started working in eastern and central europe and moved to russia
our first loan in russia was in chelyabinsk
ill bet half of you have never heard of that place
in the south of russia theres a guy called boris nikolayevich kirshin who is running an independent newspaper there
the city was closed until early because of all things they were producing glass for tupolev planes
anyway hes running independent newspaper there
after two years working with us he becomes the most respected newspaper in that small place
governor comes to him one day actually invites him to come to his office
he goes and sees the governor the governor says boris nikolayevich i understand you are doing a great job and you are the most respected newspaper in our district
and i want to offer you a deal
can you please give me your newspaper for the next nine months because i have elections there are elections coming up in nine months
i will not run but its very important for me who is going to succeed me
so give me the paper for nine months ill give it back to you
i have no interest in being in media business
how much would that cost
boris nikolayevich says its not for sale
the governor says we will close you
boris nikolayevich says no you cannot do it
six months later the newspaper was closed
luckily we had enough time to help boris nikolayevich take all the assets out of that company and bring him into a new one to get all the subscription lists rehire staff
so what the governor got was an empty shell
but that is what happens if youre in business of independent media and if you are a banker for independent media
so it sounds like a great story
somewhere down the road we opened a media management center
we started our media lab sounds like a real great story
but there is a second angle to that
the second angle like in this clip
if you take the camera above you start thinking about these numbers again
million dollars over years spread over countries
that is not too much is it
its actually just a drop in the sea
because when you think about the importance some of the issues that we were talking about last night this last session we had about africa and his hypothetical billion dollars destined for africa
all of those not all half of those problems mentioned last night government accountability corruption how do you fight corruption giving voice to unheard to poor its why independent media is in business
and its why it was invented
so from that perspective what we did is just really one drop in the sea of that need that we can identify
now ours is just one story
im sure that in this room there are like other wonderful stories of nonprofits doing spectacular work
here is where the problem is and ill explain to you as well as i can what the problem is
and its called fundraising
imagine that this third of this room is filled with people who represent different foundations
imagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations doing very important work
now imagine that every second person over here is deaf does not hear and switch the lights off
now that is how difficult it is to match people from this side of the room with people of that side of the room
so we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed to reform to totally rethink fundraising
you know instead of people running in this dark trying to find their own match who will be willing who has the same goals
instead of all of that we thought there is something new needs to be invented
and we came up with this idea of issuing bonds press freedom bonds
if there are investors willing to finance u s government budget deficit why wouldnt we find investors willing to finance press freedom deficit
weve decided to do it this fall we will issue them probably in denominations of dollars
i dont want to advertise them too much thats not the point
but the point is if we ever survive to actually issue them find enough investors that this can be considered a success theres nothing stopping the next organization to start to issue bonds next spring
and those can be environmental bonds
and then two weeks later iqbal quadir can issue his electricity in bangladesh bonds
and before you know it any social cause can be actually financed in this way
now we do daydreaming in with seconds left
but lets take the idea further
you do it you start it in the states because its you know concepts are very very close to american minds
but you can actually bring it to europe too
you can bring it to asia
you can once you have all of those different points you can make it easy for investors
put all of those bonds at one place and they sit down and click
once you have more than of them you have to develop some kind of a matrix
what do investors get
on one side financial on the other side social
so that brings the idea of some kind of rating agency morningstar type
it says you know social impact over here is spectacular five stars
financial they give you one percent only one star
now take it to the last step
once you have all of that put together theres not one reason why you couldnt actually have a marketplace for all of that where you cannot dispose of all of those bonds in a pretty quick way
and in that way you organize the financing so there are no dark rooms no blind people running around to find each other
thank you

title jonathan harris the webs secret stories title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript jonathan harris wants to make sense of the emotional world of the web with deep compassion for the human condition his projects troll the internet to find out what were all feeling and looking for description
so i really consider myself a storyteller
but i dont really tell stories in the usual way in the sense that i dont usually tell my own stories
instead im really interested in building tools that allow large numbers of other people to tell their stories people all around the world
i do this because i think that people actually have a lot in common
i think people are very similar but i also think that we have trouble seeing that
you know as i look around the world i see a lot of gaps and i think we all see a lot of gaps
and we define ourselves by our gaps
theres language gaps theres ethnicity and racial gaps theres age gaps theres gender gaps theres sexuality gaps theres wealth and money gaps theres education gaps theres also religious gaps
you know we have all these gaps and i think we like our gaps because they make us feel like we identify with something some smaller community
but i think that actually despite our gaps we really have a lot in common
and i think one thing we have in common is a very deep need to express ourselves
i think this is a very old human desire its nothing new
but the thing about self expression is that theres traditionally been this imbalance between the desire that we have to express ourselves and the number of sympathetic friends who are willing to stand around and listen
this also is nothing new
since the dawn of human history weve tried to rectify this imbalance by making art writing poems singing songs scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper gossiping with friends this is nothing new
whats new is that in the last several years a lot of these very traditional physical human activities these acts of self expression have been moving onto the internet
and as thats happened people have been leaving behind footprints footprints that tell stories of their moments of self expression
and so what i do is i write computer programs that study very large sets of these footprints and then try to draw conclusions about the people who left them what they feel what they think whats different in the world today than usual these sorts of questions
one project that explores these ideas which was made about a year ago is a piece called we feel fine
this is a piece that every two or three minutes scans the worlds newly posted blog entries for occurrences of the phrases i feel or i am feeling
and when it finds one of those phrases it grabs the sentence up to the period and then automatically tries to deduce the age gender and geographical location of the person that wrote that sentence
then knowing the geographical location and the time we can also then figure out the weather when that person wrote the sentence
all of this information is saved in a database that collects about feelings a day
its been running for about a year and a half
its reached about seven and a half million human feelings now
and ill show you a glimpse of how this information is then visualized so this is we feel fine
what you see here is a madly swarming mass of particles each of which represents a single human feeling that was stated in the last few hours
the color of each particle corresponds to the type of feeling inside so that happy positive feelings are brightly colored
and sad negative feelings are darkly colored
the diameter of each dot represents the length of the sentence inside so that the large dots contain large sentences and the small dots contain small sentences
any dot can be clicked and expanded and we see here i would just feel so much better if i could curl up in his arms right now and feel his affection for me in the embrace of his body and the tenderness of his lips
so it gets pretty hot and steamy sometimes in the world of human emotions
and all of these are stated by people i know that objectively it really doesnt mean much but after spending so many years as a small fish in a big pond its nice to feel bigger again
the dots exhibit human qualities they kind of have their own physics and they swarm wildly around kind of exploring the world of life
and then they also exhibit curiosity
you can see a few of them are swarming around the cursor right now
you can see some other ones are swarming around the bottom left corner of the screen around six words those six words represent the six movements of we feel fine were currently seeing madness
theres also murmurs montage mobs metrics and mounds
and ill walk you through a few of those now
murmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling
and then one by one in reverse chronological order they excuse themselves entering the scrolling list of feelings
i feel a bit better now
i feel confused and unsure of what the hell i want to do
i feel gypped out of something awesome here
i feel so free i feel so good
i feel like im in this fog of depression that i cant get out of
and you can click any of these to go out and visit the blog from which it was collected and in that way you can connect with the authors of these statements if you feel some degree of empathy
the next movement is called montage
montage causes all of the feelings that contain photographs to become extracted and display themselves in a grid
this grid is then said to represent the picture of the worlds feelings in the last few hours if you will
each of these can be clicked and we can blow it up
we see i just feel like im not going to have fun if its not the both of us that was from someone in michigan
we see i feel like i have been at a computer all day
these are automatically constructed using the found objects i think i feel a little full
the next movement is called mobs
mobs provides different statistical breakdowns of the population of the worlds feelings in the last few hours
we see that better is the most frequent feeling right now followed by good bad guilty right down sick and so on
we can also get a gender breakdown
and we see that women are slightly more prolific talking about their emotions in the last few hours than men
we can do an age breakdown which gives us a histogram of the worlds emotional distribution by age
we see people in their twenties are the most prolific followed by teenagers and then people in their thirties and it dies out very quickly from there
in weather the feelings assume the physical characteristics of the weather that they represent so that the ones collected on a sunny day swirl around as if theyre part of the sun
the cloudy ones float along as if theyre on a breeze
the rainy ones fall down as if theyre in a rainstorm and the snowy ones kind of flutter to the ground
finally location causes the feelings to move to their positions on a world map showing the geographical distribution of feelings
metrics provides more numerical views on the data
we see that the world is feeling used at times the normal level right now
theyre feeling warm at times the normal level and so on
other views are also available
here are gender age weather location
the final movement is called mounds
its a bit different from the others
mounds visualizes the entire dataset as large gelatinous blobs which kind of jiggle
and if i hold down my cursor they do a little dance
we see better is the most frequent feeling followed by bad
and then if i go over here the list begins to scroll and there are actually thousands of feelings that have been collected
you can see the little pink cursor moving along representing our position
here we see people that feel slipping nauseous responsible
theres also a search capability if youre interested in finding out about a certain population
for instance you could find women who feel addicted in their when it was cloudy in bangladesh
but ill spare you that
so here are some of my favorite montages that have been collected i feel so much of my dad alive in me that there isnt even room for me
i feel very lonely
i need to be in some backwoods redneck town so that i can feel beautiful
i feel invisible to you
i wouldnt hide it if society didnt make me feel like i needed to
i feel in love with carolyn i feel so naughty
i feel these weirdoes are actually an asset to college life
i love how i feel today
so as you can see we feel fine uses a technique that i call passive observation
what i mean by that is that it passively observes people as they live their lives it scans the worlds blogs and looks at what people are writing and these people dont know theyre being watched or interviewed
and because of that you end up getting very honest candid sincere responses that are often very moving
and this is a technique that i usually prefer in my work because people dont know theyre being interviewed
theyre just living life and they end up just acting like that
another technique is directly questioning people
and this is a technique that i explored in a different project the yahoo time capsule which was designed to take a fingerprint of the world in
it was divided into ten very simple themes love anger sadness and so on each of which contained a single very open ended question put to the world what do you love what makes you angry
what makes you sad what do you believe in and so on
the time capsule was available for one month online translated into languages and this is what it looked like
its a spinning globe the surface of which is entirely composed of the pictures and words and drawings of people that submitted to the time capsule
the ten themes radiate out and orbit the time capsule
you can sift through this data and see what people have submitted
this is in response to whats beautiful miss world
there are two modes to the time capsule
theres one world which presents the spinning globe and many voices which splits the data out into film strips and lets you sift through them one by one
so this project was punctuated by a really amazing event which was held in the desert outside albuquerque in new mexico at the jemez pueblo where for three consecutive nights the contents of the capsule were projected onto the sides of the ancient red rock canyon walls which stand about feet tall it was really incredible
and we also projected the contents of the time capsule as binary code using a watt laser into outer space
you can see the orange line leaving the desert floor at about a degree angle there this was amazing because the first night i looked at all this information and really started seeing the gaps that i talked about earlier the differences in age gender and wealth and so on
but you know as i looked at this more and more and more and saw these images go across the rocks i realized i was seeing the same archetypal events depicted again and again and again
you know weddings births funerals the first car the first kiss the first camel or horse depending on the culture
and it was really moving and this picture here was taken the final night from a distant cliff about two miles away where the contents of the capsule were being beamed into space
and there was something very moving about all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky
and it started to make me think a lot about the night sky and how humans have always used the night sky to project their great stories
you know as a child in vermont on a farm where i grew up i would often look up into the dark sky and see the three star belt of orion the hunter
and as an adult ive been more aware of the great greek myths playing out in the sky overhead every night
you know orion facing the roaring bull
perseus flying to the rescue of andromeda
zeus battling chronos for control of mount olympus
i mean these are the great tales of the greeks
and it caused me to wonder about our world today
and it caused me to wonder specifically if we could make new constellations today what would those look like what would those be
if we could make new pictures in the sky what would we draw
what are the great stories of today
and those are the questions that inspired my new project which is debuting here today at ted
nobodys seen this yet publicly
its called universe revealing our modern mythology
and it uses this metaphor of an interactive night sky
so its my great pleasure now to show this to you
so universe will open here
and youll see that it leads with a shifting star field and theres an aurora borealis in the background kind of morphing with color the color of the aurora borealis can be controlled using this single bar of color at the bottom and well put it down here to red
so you see this kind of these stars moving along
now these arent just little points of light little pixels
each of those stars actually represents a specific event in the real world a quote that was stated by somebody an image a news story a person a company you know some kind of heroic personality
and you might notice that as the cursor begins to touch some of these stars that shapes begin to emerge
we see here theres a little man walking along or maybe a woman
and we see here a photograph with a head
you can start to see words emerging here
and those are the constellations of today
and i can turn them all on and you can see them moving across the sky now
this is the universe of the last two months
the data from this is global news coverage from thousands of news sources around the world
its using the api of a really great company that i work with in new york actually called daylife
and its kind of the zeitgeist view at this level of the worlds current mythology over the last couple of months
so we can see where its emerging here like president ford iraq bush and we can actually isolate just the words i call them secrets and we can cause them to form an alphabetical list and we see anna nicole smith playing a big role recently
president ford this is gerald fords funeral
we can actually click anything in universe and have it become the center of the universe and everything else will enter its orbit
so well click ford and now that becomes the center
and the things that relate to ford enter its orbit and swirl around it
we can isolate just the photographs and we now see those
we can click on one of those and have the photograph be the center of the universe
now the things that relate to it are swirling around
we can click on this and we see this iconic image of betty ford kissing her husbands coffin
in universe theres kind of no end it just goes infinitely and you can just kind of click on stuff
this is a photographic representation called snapshots
but we can actually be more specific in defining our universe
so if we want to lets check out what bill clintons universe looks like
and lets see in the past week what hes been up to
so now we have a new universe which is just constrained to all things bill clinton
we can have his constellations emerge here
we can pull out his secrets and we see that it has a lot to do with candidates hillary presidential barack obama
we can see the stories that bill clinton is taking part in right now
any of those can be opened up
so we see obama and the clintons meet in alabama
you can see that this is an important story there are a lot of things in its orbit if we open this up we get different perspectives on this story
you can click any of those to go out and read the article at the source this ones from al jazeera
we can also see the superstars these would be the people that are kind of the looming heroes and heroines in the universe of bill clinton so theres bill clinton hillary iraq george bush barack obama scooter libby these are kind of the people of bill clinton
we can also see a world map so this shows us the geographic reach of bill clinton in the last week or so
we can see hes been focused in america because hes been campaigning probably but a little bit of action over here in the middle east
and then we can also see a timeline
so we see that he was a bit quiet on saturday but he was back to work on sunday morning and actually been tapering off since then this week
and its not limited to just people or dates but we can actually put in concepts also
so if i put in climate change for all of well see what that universe looks like
here we have our star field here we have our shapes
here we have our secrets
so we see again climate change is large nairobi global conference environmental
and there are also quotes that you can see if youre interested in reading about quotes on climate change
you know this is really an infinite thing
the superstars of climate change in united states britain china you know these are the towering countries that kind of define this concept
so this is a piece that demands exploration
this will be online in several days probably next tuesday
and youll all be able to use it and kind of explore what your own personal mythology might be
youll notice that in daylife rather in universe it supports both the notion of a global mythology which is represented by something as broad as say and also a personal mythology
as you search for the things that are important to you in your world and then see what the constellations of those might look like
so its been a pleasure thank you very much

title howard rheingold the new power of collaboration title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript howard rheingold talks about the coming world of collaboration participatory media and collective action and how wikipedia is really an outgrowth of our natural human instinct to work as a group description
im here to enlist you in helping reshape the story about how humans and other critters get things done
here is the old story weve already heard a little bit about it biology is war in which only the fiercest survive businesses and nations succeed only by defeating destroying and dominating competition politics is about your side winning at all costs
but i think we can see the very beginnings of a new story beginning to emerge
its a narrative spread across a number of different disciplines in which cooperation collective action and complex interdependencies play a more important role
and the central but not all important role of competition and survival of the fittest shrinks just a little bit to make room
i started thinking about the relationship between communication media and collective action when i wrote smart mobs and i found that when i finished the book i kept thinking about it
in fact if you look back human communication media and the ways in which we organize socially have been co evolving for quite a long time
humans have lived for much much longer than the approximately years of settled agricultural civilization in small family groups nomadic hunters bring down rabbits gathering food
the form of wealth in those days was enough food to stay alive
but at some point they banded together to hunt bigger game
and we dont know exactly how they did this although they must have solved some collective action problems it only makes sense that you cant hunt mastodons while youre fighting with the other groups
and again we have no way of knowing but its clear that a new form of wealth must have emerged
more protein than a hunters family could eat before it rotted
so that raised a social question that i believe must have driven new social forms
did the people who ate that mastodon meat owe something to the hunters and their families
and if so how did they make arrangements
again we cant know but we can be pretty sure that some form of symbolic communication must have been involved
of course with agriculture came the first big civilizations the first cities built of mud and brick the first empires
and it was the administers of these empires who began hiring people to keep track of the wheat and sheep and wine that was owed and the taxes that was owed on them by making marks marks on clay in that time
not too much longer after that the alphabet was invented
and this powerful tool was really reserved for thousands of years for the elite administrators who kept track of accounts for the empires
and then another communication technology enabled new media the printing press came along and within decades millions of people became literate
and from literate populations new forms of collective action emerged in the spheres of knowledge religion and politics
we saw scientific revolutions the protestant reformation constitutional democracies possible where they had not been possible before
not created by the printing press but enabled by the collective action that emerges from literacy
and again new forms of wealth emerged
now commerce is ancient markets are as old as the crossroads
but capitalism as we know it is only a few hundred years old enabled by cooperative arrangements and technologies such as the joint stock ownership company shared liability insurance double entry bookkeeping
now of course the enabling technologies are based on the internet and in the many to many era every desktop is now a printing press a broadcasting station a community or a marketplace
evolution is speeding up
more recently that power is untethering and leaping off the desktops and very very quickly were going to see a significant proportion if not the majority of the human race walking around holding carrying or wearing supercomputers linked at speeds greater than what we consider to be broadband today
now when i started looking into collective action the considerable literature on it is based on what sociologists call social dilemmas
and there are a couple of mythic narratives of social dilemmas
im going to talk briefly about two of them the prisoners dilemma and the tragedy of the commons
now when i talked about this with kevin kelly he assured me that everybody in this audience pretty much knows the details of the prisoners dilemma so im just going to go over that very very quickly
if you have more questions about it ask kevin kelly later
the prisoners dilemma is actually a story thats overlaid on a mathematical matrix that came out of the game theory in the early years of thinking about nuclear war two players who couldnt trust each other
let me just say that every unsecured transaction is a good example of a prisoners dilemma
person with the goods person with the money because they cant trust each other are not going to exchange
neither one wants to be the first one or theyre going to get the suckers payoff but both lose of course because they dont get what they want
if they could only agree if they could only turn a prisoners dilemma into a different payoff matrix called an assurance game they could proceed
twenty years ago robert axelrod used the prisoners dilemma as a probe of the biological question if we are here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors how does cooperation exist at all
he started a computer tournament for people to submit prisoners dilemma strategies and discovered much to his surprise that a very very simple strategy won it won the first tournament and even after everyone knew it won it won the second tournament thats known as tit for tat
another economic game that may not be as well known as the prisoners dilemma is the ultimatum game and its also a very interesting probe of our assumptions about the way people make economic transactions
heres how the game is played there are two players theyve never played the game before they will not play the game again they dont know each other and they are in fact in separate rooms
first player is offered a hundred dollars and is asked to propose a split whatever that player wants to propose the second player either accepts the split both players are paid and the game is over or rejects the split neither player is paid and the game is over
now the fundamental basis of neoclassical economics would tell you its irrational to reject a dollar because someone you dont know in another room is going to get
yet in thousands of trials with american and european and japanese students a significant percentage would reject any offer thats not close to
and although they were screened and didnt know about the game and had never played the game before proposers seemed to innately know this because the average proposal was surprisingly close to
now the interesting part comes in more recently when anthropologists began taking this game to other cultures and discovered to their surprise that slash and burn agriculturalists in the amazon or nomadic pastoralists in central asia or a dozen different cultures each had radically different ideas of what is fair
which suggests that instead of there being an innate sense of fairness that somehow the basis of our economic transactions can be influenced by our social institutions whether we know that or not
the other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons
garrett hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late
he used the example of a common grazing area in which each person by simply maximizing their own flock led to overgrazing and the depletion of the resource
he had the rather gloomy conclusion that humans will inevitably despoil any common pool resource in which people cannot be restrained from using it
now elinor ostrom a political scientist in asked the interesting question that any good scientist should ask which is is it really true that humans will always despoil commons
so she went out and looked at what data she could find
she looked at thousands of cases of humans sharing watersheds forestry resources fisheries and discovered that yes in case after case humans destroyed the commons that they depended on
but she also found many instances in which people escaped the prisoners dilemma in fact the tragedy of the commons is a multiplayer prisoners dilemma
and she said that people are only prisoners if they consider themselves to be
they escape by creating institutions for collective action
and she discovered i think most interestingly that among those institutions that worked there were a number of common design principles and those principles seem to be missing from those institutions that dont work
im moving very quickly over a number of disciplines in biology the notions of symbiosis group selection evolutionary psychology are contested to be sure
but there is really no longer any major debate over the fact that cooperative arrangements have moved from a peripheral role to a central role in biology from the level of the cell to the level of the ecology
and again our notions of individuals as economic beings have been overturned
rational self interest is not always the dominating factor
in fact people will act to punish cheaters even at a cost to themselves
and most recently neurophysiological measures have shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games show activity in the reward centers of their brain
which led one scientist to declare that altruistic punishment may be the glue that holds societies together
now ive been talking about how new forms of communication and new media in the past have helped create new economic forms
commerce is ancient markets are very old capitalism is fairly recent socialism emerged as a reaction to that
and yet we see very little talk about how the next form may be emerging
jim surowiecki briefly mentioned yochai benklers paper about open source pointing to a new form of production peer to peer production
i simply want you to keep in mind that if in the past new forms of cooperation enabled by new technologies create new forms of wealth we may be moving into yet another economic form that is significantly different from previous ones
very briefly lets look at some businesses ibm as you know hp sun some of the most fierce competitors in the it world are open sourcing their software are providing portfolios of patents for the commons
eli lilly in again the fiercely competitive pharmaceutical world has created a market for solutions for pharmaceutical problems
toyota instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace treats them as a network and trains them to produce better even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors
now none of these companies are doing this out of altruism theyre doing it because theyre learning that a certain kind of sharing is in their self interest
open source production has shown us that world class software like linux and mozilla can be created with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firm nor the incentives of the marketplace as weve known them
google enriches itself by enriching thousands of bloggers through adsense
amazon has opened its application programming interface to developers countless amazon shops
theyre enriching others not out of altruism but as a way of enriching themselves
ebay solved the prisoners dilemma and created a market where none would have existed by creating a feedback mechanism that turns a prisoners dilemma game into an assurance game
instead of neither of us can trust each other so we have to make suboptimal moves its you prove to me that you are trustworthy and i will cooperate
wikipedia has used thousands of volunteers to create a free encyclopedia with a million and a half articles in languages in just a couple of years
weve seen that thinkcycle has enabled ngos in developing countries to put up problems to be solved by design students around the world including something thats being used for tsunami relief right now its a mechanism for rehydrating cholera victims thats so simple to use it illiterates can be trained to use it
bittorrent turns every downloader into an uploader making the system more efficient the more it is used
millions of people have contributed their desktop computers when theyre not using them to link together through the internet into supercomputing collectives that help solve the protein folding problem for medical researchers thats folding home at stanford to crack codes to search for life in outer space
i dont think we know enough yet
i dont think weve even begun to discover what the basic principles are but i think we can begin to think about them
and i dont have enough time to talk about all of them but think about self interest
this is all about self interest that adds up to more
in el salvador both sides that withdrew from their civil war took moves that had been proven to mirror a prisoners dilemma strategy
in the u s in the philippines in kenya around the world citizens have self organized political protests and get out the vote campaigns using mobile devices and sms
is an apollo project of cooperation possible
a transdisciplinary study of cooperation
i believe that the payoff would be very big
i think we need to begin developing maps of this territory so that we can talk about it across disciplines
and i am not saying that understanding cooperation and sometimes people cooperate to do bad things but i will remind you that a few hundred years ago people saw their loved ones die from diseases they thought were caused by sin or foreigners or evil spirits
descartes said we need an entire new way of thinking
when the scientific method provided that new way of thinking and biology showed that microorganisms caused disease suffering was alleviated
what forms of suffering could be alleviated what forms of wealth could be created if we knew a little bit more about cooperation
i dont think that this transdisciplinary discourse is automatically going to happen its going to require effort
so i enlist you to help me get the cooperation project started
thank you

title gordon brown wiring a web for global good title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript were at a unique moment in history says uk prime minister gordon brown we can use todays interconnectedness to develop our shared global ethic and work together to confront the challenges of poverty security climate change and the economy description
can i say how delighted i am to be away from the calm of westminster and whitehall
this is kim a nine year old vietnam girl her back ruined by napalm and she awakened the conscience of the nation of america to begin to end the vietnam war
this is birhan who was the ethiopian girl who launched live aid in the minutes away from death when she was rescued and that picture of her being rescued is one that went round the world
this is tiananmen square
a man before a tank became a picture that became a symbol for the whole world of resistance
this next is the sudanese girl a few moments from death a vulture hovering in the background a picture that went round the world and shocked people into action on poverty
this is neda the iranian girl who was shot while at a demonstration with her father in iran only a few weeks ago and she is now the focus rightly so of the youtube generation
and what do all these pictures and events have in common
what they have in common is what we see unlocks what we cannot see
what we see unlocks the invisible ties and bonds of sympathy that bring us together to become a human community
what these pictures demonstrate is that we do feel the pain of others however distantly
what i think these pictures demonstrate is that we do believe in something bigger than ourselves
what these pictures demonstrate is that there is a moral sense across all religions across all faiths across all continents a moral sense that not only do we share the pain of others and believe in something bigger than ourselves but we have a duty to act when we see things that are wrong that need righted see injuries that need to be corrected see problems that need to be rectified
there is a story about olof palme the swedish prime minister going to see ronald reagan in america in the
before he arrived ronald reagan said and he was the swedish social democratic prime minister isn t this man a communist
the reply was no mr president he s an anti communist
and ronald reagan said i don t care what kind of communist he is
ronald reagan asked olof palme the social democratic prime minister of sweden well what do you believe in do you want to abolish the rich
he said no i want to abolish the poor
our responsibility is to let everyone have the chance to realize their potential to the full
i believe there is a moral sense and a global ethic that commands attention from people of every religion and every faith and people of no faith
but i think whats new is that we now have the capacity to communicate instantaneously across frontiers right across the world
we now have the capacity to find common ground with people who we will never meet but who we will meet through the internet and through all the modern means of communication that we now have the capacity to organize and take collective action together to deal with the problem or an injustice that we want to deal with and i believe that this makes this a unique age in human history and it is the start of what i would call the creation of a truly global society
go back years when the slave trade was under pressure from william wilberforce and all the protesters
they protested across britain
they won public opinion over a long period of time
but it took years for the campaign to be successful
what could they have done with the pictures that they could have shown if they were able to use the modern means of communication to win people s hearts and minds
or if you take eglantyne jebb the woman who created save the children years ago
she was so appalled by what was happening in austria as a result of the first world war and what was happening to children who were part of the defeated families of austria that in britain she wanted to take action but she had to go house to house leaflet to leaflet to get people to attend a rally in the royal albert hall that eventually gave birth to save the children an international organization that is now fully recognized as one of the great institutions in our land and in the world
but what more could she have done if she d had the modern means of communications available to her to create a sense that the injustice that people saw had to be acted upon immediately
now look at what s happened in the last years
in philippines in president estrada a million people texted each other about the corruption of that regime eventually brought it down and it was of course called the coup de text
then you have in zimbabwe the first election under robert mugabe a year ago
because people were able to take mobile phone photographs of what was happening at the polling stations it was impossible for that premier to fix that election in the way that he wanted to do
or take burma and the monks that were blogging out a country that nobody knew anything about that was happening until these blogs told the world that there was a repression meaning that lives were being lost and people were being persecuted and aung san suu kyi who is one of the great prisoners of conscience of the world had to be listened to
then take iran itself and what people are doing today following what happened to neda people who are preventing the security services of iran finding those people who are blogging out of iran any by everybody who is blogging changing their address to tehran iran and making it difficult for the security services
take therefore what modern technology is capable of the power of our moral sense allied to the power of communications and our ability to organize internationally
that in my view gives us the first opportunity as a community to fundamentally change the world
foreign policy can never be the same again it cannot be run by elites it s got to be run by listening to the public opinions of peoples who are blogging who are communicating with each other around the world
years ago the problem we had to solve was slavery
years ago i suppose the main problem in a country like ours was how young people children had the right to education
years ago in most countries in europe the pressure was for the right to vote
years ago the pressure was for the right to social security and welfare
in the last years we have seen fascism anti semitism racism apartheid discrimination on the basis of sex and gender and sexuality all these have come under pressure because of the campaigns that have been run by people to change the world
i was with nelson mandela a year ago when he was in london
i was at a concert that he was attending to mark his birthday and for the creation of new resources for his foundation
i was sitting next to nelson mandela i was very privileged to do so when amy winehouse came onto the stage
and nelson mandela was quite surprised at the appearance of the singer and i was explaining to him at the time who she was
amy winehouse said nelson mandela and i have a lot in common
my husband too has spent a long time in prison
nelson mandela then went down to the stage and he summarized the challenge for us all
he said in his lifetime he had climbed a great mountain the mountain of challenging and then defeating racial oppression and defeating apartheid
he said that there was a greater challenge ahead the challenge of poverty of climate change global challenges that needed global solutions and needed the creation of a truly global society
we are the first generation which is in a position to do this
combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate and organize globally with the challenges that we now face most of which are global in their nature
climate change cannot be solved in one country but has got to be solved by the world working together
a financial crisis just as we have seen could not be solved by america alone or europe alone it needed the world to work together
take the problems of security and terrorism and equally the problem of human rights and development they cannot be solved by africa alone they cannot be solved by america or europe alone
we cannot solve these problems unless we work together
so the great project of our generation it seems to me is to build for the first time out of a global ethic and our global ability to communicate and organize together a truly global society built on that ethic but with institutions that can serve that global society and make for a different future
we have now and are the first generation with the power to do this
take climate change is it not absolutely scandalous that we have a situation where we know that there is a climate change problem where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources to the poorest countries to deal with that when we want to create a global carbon market but there is no global institution that people have been able to agree upon to deal with this problem
one of the things that has got to come out of copenhagen in the next few months is an agreement that there will be a global environmental institution that is able to deal with the problems of persuading the whole of the world to move along a climate change agenda
one of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough is that we have got to persuade people around the world to change their behavior as well so you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility across the generations
take the financial crisis
if people in poorer countries can be hit by a crisis that starts in new york or starts in the sub prime market of the united states of america
if people can find that that sub prime product has been transferred across nations many many times until it ends up in banks in iceland or the rest in britain and peoples ordinary savings are affected by it then you cannot rely on a system of national supervision
you need in the long run for stability for economic growth for jobs as well as for financial stability global economic institutions that make sure that growth to be sustained has to be shared and are built on the principle that the prosperity of this world is indivisible
so another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility not the ideas that were the basis of the last stage of financial development over these recent years
then take development and take the partnership we need between our countries and the rest of the world the poorest part of the world
we do not have the basis of a proper partnership for the future and yet out of people s desire for a global ethic and a global society that can be done
i have just been talking to the president of sierra leone
this is a country of six and a half million people but it has only doctors it has nurses it has midwives
you cannot begin to build a healthcare system for six million people with such limited resources
or take the girl i met when i was in tanzania a girl called miriam
she was years old her parents had both died from aids her mother and then her father
she was an aids orphan being handed across different extended families to be cared for
she herself was suffering from hiv she was suffering from tuberculosis
i met her in a field she was ragged she had no shoes
when you looked in her eyes any girl at the age of eleven is looking forward to the future but there was an unreachable sadness in that girl s eyes and if i could have translated that to the rest of the world for that moment i believe that all the work that it had done for the global hiv aids fund would be rewarded by people being prepared to make donations
we must then build a proper relationship between the richest and the poorest countries based on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture so that africa is not a net importer of food but an exporter of food
take the problems of human rights and the problems of security in so many countries around the world
burma is in chains zimbabwe is a human tragedy in sudan thousands of people have died unnecessarily for wars that we could prevent
in the rwanda childrens museum there is a photograph of a year old boy and the childrens museum is commemorating the lives that were lost in the rwandan genocide where a million people died
there is a photograph of a boy called david
beside that photograph there is the information about his life
it said david age
david ambition to be a doctor
favorite sport football what did he enjoy most
making people laugh
how did he die
tortured to death
last words said to his mother who was also tortured to death dont worry the united nations are coming
and we never did
and that young boy believed our promises that we would help people in difficulty in rwanda and we never did
so we have got to create in this world also institutions for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid but also for reconstruction and security for some of the conflict ridden states of the world
so my argument today is basically this
we have the means by which we could create a truly global society
the institutions of this global society can be created by our endeavors
that global ethic can infuse the fairness and responsibility that is necessary for these institutions to work but we should not lose the chance in this generation in this decade in particular with president obama in america with other people working with us around the world to create global institutions for the environment and for finance and for security and for development that make sense of our responsibility to other peoples our desire to bind the world together and our need to tackle problems that everybody knows exist
it is said that in ancient rome that when cicero spoke to his audiences people used to turn to each other and say about cicero great speech
but it is said that in ancient greece when demosthenes spoke to his audiences people turned to each other and didn t say great speech
they said lets march
we should be marching towards a global society
thank you

title oliver sacks what hallucination reveals about our minds title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript neurologist and author oliver sacks brings our attention to charles bonnet syndrome when visually impaired people experience lucid hallucinations he describes the experiences of his patients in heartwarming detail and walks us through the biology of this under reported phenomenon description
we see with the eyes but we see with the brain as well
and seeing with the brain is often called imagination
and we are familiar with the landscapes of our own imagination our inscapes weve lived with them all our lives
but there are also hallucinations as well and hallucinations are completely different
they dont seem to be of our creation
they dont seem to be under our control
they seem to come from the outside and to mimic perception
so i am going to be talking about hallucinations and a particular sort of visual hallucination which i see among my patients
a few months ago i got a phone call from a nursing home where i work
they told me that one of their residents an old lady in her was seeing things and they wondered if shed gone bonkers or because she was an old lady whether shed had a stroke or whether she had alzheimers
and so they asked me if i would come and see rosalie the old lady
i went in to see her
it was evident straight away that she was perfectly sane and lucid and of good intelligence but shed been very startled and very bewildered because shed been seeing things
and she told me the nurses hadnt mentioned this that she was blind that she had been completely blind from macular degeneration for five years
but now for the last few days shed been seeing things
so i said what sort of things
and she said people in eastern dress in drapes walking up and down stairs
a man who turns towards me and smiles
but he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth
animals too
i see a white building its snowing a soft snow
i see this horse with a harness dragging the snow away
then one night the scene changes
i see cats and dogs walking towards me
they come to a certain point and then stop
then it changes again
i see a lot of children they are walking up and down stairs
they wear bright colors rose and blue like eastern dress
sometimes she said before the people come on she may hallucinate pink and blue squares on the floor which seem to go up to the ceiling
i said is this like a dream
and she said no its not like a dream its like a movie
she said its got color its got motion
but its completely silent like a silent movie
and she said that its a rather boring movie
she said all these people with eastern dress walking up and down very repetitive very limited
and she has a sense of humor
she knew it was a hallucination
but she was frightened shed lived years and shed never had a hallucination before
she said that the hallucinations were unrelated to anything she was thinking or feeling or doing that they seemed to come on by themselves or disappear
she had no control over them
she said she didnt recognize any of the people or places in the hallucinations
and none of the people or the animals well they all seemed oblivious of her
and she didnt know what was going on
she wondered if she was going mad or losing her mind
well i examined her carefully
she was a bright old lady perfectly sane she had no medical problems
she wasnt on any medications which could produce hallucinations
but she was blind
and i then said to her i think i know what you have
i said there is a special form of visual hallucination which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness
this was originally described i said right back in the century by a man called charles bonnet
and you have charles bonnet syndrome
there is nothing wrong with your brain there is nothing wrong with your mind
you have charles bonnet syndrome
and she was very relieved at this that there was nothing seriously the matter and also rather curious
she said who is this charles bonnet
she said did he have them himself
and she said tell all the nurses that i have charles bonnet syndrome
im not crazy im not demented i have charles bonnet syndrome
well so i did tell the nurses
now this for me is a common situation
i work in old age homes largely
i see a lot of elderly people who are hearing impaired or visually impaired
about percent of the hearing impaired people get musical hallucinations
and about percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations
you dont have to be completely blind only sufficiently impaired
now with the original description in the century charles bonnet did not have them
his grandfather had these hallucinations
his grandfather was a magistrate an elderly man
hed had cataract surgery
his vision was pretty poor
and in he described to his grandson various things he was seeing
the first thing he said was he saw a handkerchief in midair
it was a large blue handkerchief with four orange circles
and he knew it was a hallucination
you dont have handkerchiefs in midair
and then he saw a big wheel in midair
but sometimes he wasnt sure whether he was hallucinating or not because the hallucinations would fit in the context of the visions
so on one occasion when his granddaughters were visiting them he said and who are these handsome young men with you
and they said alas grandpapa there are no handsome young men
and then the handsome young men disappeared
its typical of these hallucinations that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash
they dont usually fade in and out
they are rather sudden and they change suddenly
charles lullin the grandfather saw hundreds of different figures different landscapes of all sorts
on one occasion he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe and realized it was himself
that was the only figure he recognized
on one occasion when he was walking in the streets of paris he saw this was real a scaffolding
but when he got back home he saw a miniature of the scaffolding six inches high on his study table
this repetition of perception is sometimes called palinopsia
with him and with rosalie what seems to be going on and rosalie said whats going on and i said that as you lose vision as the visual parts of the brain are no longer getting any input they become hyperactive and excitable and they start to fire spontaneously
and you start to see things
the things you see can be very complicated indeed
with another patient of mine who also had some vision the vision she had could be disturbing
on one occasion she said she saw a man in a striped shirt in a restaurant
and he turned around and then he divided into six figures in striped shirts who started walking towards her
and then the six figures came together again like a concertina
once when she was driving or rather her husband was driving the road divided into four and she felt herself going simultaneously up four roads
she had very mobile hallucinations as well
a lot of them had to do with a car
sometimes she would see a teenage boy sitting on the hood of the car
he was very tenacious and he moved rather gracefully when the car turned
and then when they came to a stop the boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff foot in the air and then disappear
another patient of mine had a different sort of hallucination
this was a woman who didnt have trouble with her eyes but the visual parts of her brain a little tumor in the occipital cortex
and above all she would see cartoons
these cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field like a screen
and especially she saw cartoons of kermit the frog
now i dont watch sesame street but she made a point of saying why kermit she said kermit the frog means nothing to me
you know i was wondering about freudian determinants
why kermit
kermit the frog means nothing to me
she didnt mind the cartoons too much
but what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces and as with rosalie the faces were often deformed with very large teeth or very large eyes
and these frightened her
well what is going on with these people
as a physician i have to try and define whats going on and to reassure people especially to reassure them that theyre not going insane
something like percent as i said of visually impaired people get these
but no more than one percent of the people acknowledge them because they are afraid they will be seen as insane or something
and if they do mention them to their own doctors they may be misdiagnosed
in particular the notion is that if you see things or hear things youre going mad but the psychotic hallucinations are quite different
psychotic hallucinations whether they are visual or vocal they address you they accuse you
they seduce you they humiliate you
they jeer at you
you interact with them
there is none of this quality of being addressed with these charles bonnet hallucinations
there is a film youre seeing a film which has nothing to do with you or thats how people think about it
there is also a rare thing called temporal lobe epilepsy and sometimes if one has this one may feel oneself transported back to a time and place in the past
youre at a particular road junction
you smell chestnuts roasting
you hear the traffic all the senses are involved
and youre waiting for your girl
and its that tuesday evening back in
and the temporal lobe hallucinations are all sense hallucinations full of feeling full of familiarity located in space and time coherent dramatic
the charles bonnet ones are quite different
so in the charles bonnet hallucinations you have all sorts of levels from the geometrical hallucinations the pink and blue squares the woman had up to quite elaborate hallucinations with figures and especially faces
faces and sometimes deformed faces are the single commonest thing in these hallucinations
and one of the second commonest is cartoons
so what is going on
fascinatingly in the last few years its been possible to do functional brain imagery to do fmri on people as they are hallucinating
and in fact to find that different parts of the visual brain are activated as they are hallucinating
when people have these simple geometrical hallucinations the primary visual cortex is activated
this is the part of the brain which perceives edges and patterns
you dont form images with your primary visual cortex
when images are formed a higher part of the visual cortex is involved in the temporal lobe
and in particular one area of the temporal lobe is called the fusiform gyrus
and its known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus they maybe lose the ability to recognize faces
but if there is an abnormal activity in the fusiform gyrus they may hallucinate faces and this is exactly what you find in some of these people
there is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus where teeth and eyes are represented and that part of the gyrus is activated when people get the deformed hallucinations
there is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons
its activated when one recognizes cartoons when one draws cartoons and when one hallucinates them
its very interesting that that should be specific
there are other parts of the brain which are specifically involved with the recognition and hallucination of buildings and landscapes
around it was found that there were not only parts of the brain but particular cells
face cells were discovered around
and now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells which can be very very specific
so you may not only have car cells you may have aston martin cells
i saw an aston martin this morning
i had to bring it in
and now its in there somewhere
now at this level in whats called the inferotemporal cortex there are only visual images or figments or fragments
its only at higher levels that the other senses join in and there are connections with memory and emotion
and in the charles bonnet syndrome you dont go to those higher levels
youre in these levels of inferior visual cortex where you have thousands and tens of thousands and millions of images or figments or fragmentary figments all neurally encoded in particular cells or small clusters of cells
normally these are all part of the integrated stream of perception or imagination and one is not conscious of them
it is only if one is visually impaired or blind that the process is interrupted
and instead of getting normal perception youre getting an anarchic convulsive stimulation or release of all of these visual cells in the inferotemporal cortex
so suddenly you see a face suddenly you see a car
suddenly this and suddenly that
the mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this but not terribly successfully
when these were first described it was thought that they could be interpreted like dreams
but in fact people say i dont recognize the people i cant form any associations
kermit means nothing to me
you dont get anywhere thinking of them as dreams
well ive more or less said what i wanted
i think i just want to recapitulate and say this is common
think of the number of blind people
there must be hundreds of thousands of blind people who have these hallucinations but are too scared to mention them
so this sort of thing needs to be brought into notice for patients for doctors for the public
finally i think they are infinitely interesting and valuable for giving one some insight as to how the brain works
charles bonnet said years ago he wondered how thinking these hallucinations how as he put it the theater of the mind could be generated by the machinery of the brain
now years later i think were beginning to glimpse how this is done
thanks very much
chris anderson that was superb thank you so much
you speak about these things with so much insight and empathy for your patients
have you yourself experienced any of the syndromes you write about
oliver sacks i was afraid youd ask that
well yeah a lot of them
and actually im a little visually impaired myself
im blind in one eye and not terribly good in the other
and i see the geometrical hallucinations
but they stop there
ca and they dont disturb you
because you understand whats doing it it doesnt make you worried
os well they dont disturb me any more than my tinnitus which i ignore
they occasionally interest me and i have many pictures of them in my notebooks
ive gone and had an fmri myself to see how my visual cortex is taking over
and when i see all these hexagons and complex things which i also have in visual migraine i wonder whether everyone sees things like this and whether things like cave art or ornamental art may have been derived from them a bit
ca that was an utterly utterly fascinating talk
thank you so much for sharing
os thank you thank you

title bart weetjens how i taught rats to sniff out land mines title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript no one knows exactly how many landmines still litter the world but its safe to say millions waiting to kill and maim unsuspecting civilians clearing them is slow expensive and dangerous the founder of apopo bart weetjens talks about his extraordinary project training rats to sniff out land mines he shows clips of his hero rats in action and previews his works next phase teaching them to turn up tuberculosis in the lab description
im here today to share with you an extraordinary journey extraordinarily rewarding journey actually which brought me into training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis
as a child i had two passions
one was a passion for rodents
i had all kinds of rats mice hamsters gerbils squirrels
you name it i bred it and i sold them to pet shops
i also had a passion for africa
growing up in a multicultural environment we had african students in the house and i learned about their stories so different backgrounds dependency on imported know how goods services exuberant cultural diversity
africa was truly fascinating for me
i became an industrial engineer engineer in product development and i focused on appropriate detection technologies actually the first appropriate technologies for developing countries
i started working in the industry but i wasnt really happy to contribute to a material consumer society in a linear extracting and manufacturing mode
i quit my job to focus on the real world problem landmines
were talking now
princess diana is announcing on tv that landmines form a structural barrier to any development which is really true
as long as these devices are there or there is suspicion of landmines you cant really enter into the land
actually there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors sustainable in the environments where theyre needed to produce which is mainly in the developing world
we chose rats
why would you choose rats
because arent they vermin
well actually rats are in contrary to what most people think about them rats are highly sociable creatures
and actually our product what you see here
theres a target somewhere here
you see an operator a trained african with his rats in front who actually are left and right
there the animal finds a mine
it scratches on the soil
and the animal comes back for a food reward
very very simple
very sustainable in this environment
here the animal gets its food reward
and thats how it works
very very simple
now why would you use rats
rats have been used since the last century in all kinds of experiments
rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species
theyre extremely sensitive to smell
moreover they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about it
now how do we communicate with rats
well dont talk rat but we have a clicker a standard method for animal training which you see there
a clicker which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behaviors
first of all we associate the click sound with a food reward which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe
once the animal knows click food click food click food so click is food we bring it in a cage with a hole and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed and to do that for five seconds five seconds which is long for a rat
once the animal knows this we make the task a bit more difficult
it learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes up to holes
then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets
in the next step animals learn to find real mines in real minefields
they are tested and accredited according to international mine action standards just like dogs have to pass a test
this consists of square meters
theres a number of mines placed blindly and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the targets
if the animal does that it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field just like dogs by the way
maybe one slight difference we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog
this is our team in mozambique one tanzanian trainer who transfers the skills to these three mozambican fellows
and you should see the pride in the eyes of these people
they have a skill which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid
moreover this small team together with of course you need the heavy vehicles and the manual de miners to follow up
but with this small investment in a rat capacity we have demonstrated in mozambique that we can reduce the cost price per square meter up to percent of what is currently normal two dollars per square meter we do it at and we can still bring that price down
question of scale
if you can bring in more rats we can actually make the output even bigger
we have a demonstration site in mozambique
eleven african governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology
they have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the great lakes region and they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines
but let me bring you to a very different problem
and theres about people last year that walked on a landmine but worldwide last year almost million died from tuberculosis as a first cause of infection
especially in africa where t b and hiv are strongly linked there is a huge common problem
microscopy the standard who procedure reaches from to percent reliability
in tanzania the numbers dont lie percent of people t b patients get diagnosed with t b before they die
it means that if you have t b you have more chance that you wont be detected but will just die from t b secondary infections and so on
and if however you are detected very early diagnosed early treatment can start and even in hiv positives it makes sense
you can actually cure t b even in hiv positives
so in our common language dutch the name for t b
is tering which etymologically refers to the smell of tar
already the old chinese and the greek hippocrates have actually published documented that t b can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from patients
so what we did is we collected some samples just as a way of testing from hospitals trained rats on them and see if this works and wonder well we can reach percent sensitivity percent specificity using multiple rats in a row
this is how it works and really this is a generic technology
were talking now explosives tuberculosis but can you imagine you can actually put anything under there
so how does it work
you have a cassette with samples
you put these samples at once in the cage
an animal only needs two hundredths of a second to discriminate the scent so it goes extremely fast
here its already at the third sample
this is a positive sample
it gets a click sound and comes for the food reward
and by doing so very fast we can have like a second line opinion to see which patients are positive which are negative
just as an indication whereas a microscopist can process samples in a day a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only
a cage like this a cage like this provided that you have rats and we have now currently tuberculosis rats a cage like this operating throughout the day can process samples
can you imagine the potential offspring applications environmental detection of pollutants in soils customs applications detection of illicit goods in containers and so on
but lets stick first to tuberculosis
i just want to briefly highlight the blue rods are the scores of microscopy only at the five clinics in dar es salaam on a population of people where reported to get a test done
microscopy for patients
and by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and looping those results back we were able to increase case detection rates by over percent
throughout last year weve been depending on which intervals you take weve been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in dar es salaam between and percent
so this is really considerable
knowing that a missed patient by microscopy infects up to people healthy people per year you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives
at least our hero rats have saved lots of lives
the way forward for us is now to standardize this technology
and there are simple things like for instance we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds
so to standardize this
also to standardize the pellets the food rewards and to semi automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people
to conclude there are also other applications at the horizon
here is a first prototype of our camera rat which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on
this is in a prototype stage
we dont have a working system here yet
to conclude i would actually like to say you may think this is about rats these projects but in the end it is about people
it is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks and doing that with a local resource plenty available
so something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about the resources surrounding you whether they are environmental technological animal or human
and to respectfully harmonize with them in order to foster a sustainable world
thank you very much

title amy tan where does creativity hide title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript novelist amy tan digs deep into the creative process looking for hints of how hers evolved description
the value of nothing out of nothing comes something
that was an essay i wrote when i was years old and i got a b
what im going to talk about nothing out of something and how we create
and im gonna try and do that within the minute time span that we were told to stay within and to follow the ted commandments that is actually something that creates a near death experience but near death is good for creativity
ok
so i also want to explain because dave eggers said he was going to heckle me if i said anything that was a lie or not true to universal creativity
and ive done it this way for half the audience who is scientific
when i say we i dont mean you necessarily i mean me and my right brain my left brain and the one thats in between that is the censor and tells me what im saying is wrong
and im going do that also by looking at what i think is part of my creative process which includes a number of things that happened actually the nothing started even earlier than the moment in which im creating something new
and that includes nature and nurture and what i refer to as nightmares
now in the nature area we look at whether or not we are innately equipped with something perhaps in our brains some abnormal chromosome that causes this muse like effect
and some people would say that were born with it in some other means
and others like my mother would say that i get my material from past lives
some people would also say that creativity may be a function of some other neurological quirk van gogh syndrome that you have a little bit of you know psychosis or depression
i do have to say somebody i read recently that van gogh wasnt really necessarily psychotic that he might have had temporal lobe seizures and that might have caused his spurt of creativity and i dont i suppose it does something in some part of your brain
and i will mention that i actually developed temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago but it was during the time i was writing my last book and some people say that book is quite different
i think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis you know who am i why am i this particular person why am i not black like everybody else
and sometimes youre equipped with skills but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity
i used to draw i thought i would be an artist
and i had a miniature poodle
and it wasnt bad but it wasnt really creative
because all i could really do was represent in a very one on one way
and i have a sense that i probably copied this from a book
and then i also wasnt really shining in a certain area that i wanted to be and you know you look at those scores and it wasnt bad but it was not certainly predictive that i would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words
also one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma
and i had the usual kind that i think a lot of people had and that is that you know i had expectations placed on me
that figure right there by the way figure right there was a toy given to me when i was but nine years old and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age
i have some ones that were long lasting from the age of five to this was supposed to be my side occupation and it led to a sense of failure
but actually there was something quite real in my life that happened when i was about
and it was discovered that my brother in and then my father six months later had brain tumors
and my mother believed that something had gone wrong and she was gonna find out what it was and she was gonna fix it
my father was a baptist minister and he believed in miracles and that gods will would take care of that
but of course they ended up dying six months apart
and after that my mother believed that it was fate or curses she went looking through all the reasons in the universe why this would have happened
everything except randomness she did not believe in randomness
there was a reason for everything
and one of the reasons she thought was that her mother who had died when she was very young was angry at her
and so i had this notion of death all around me because my mother also believed that i would be next and she would be next
and when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon you begin to think very much about everything
you become very creative in a survival sense
and this then led to my big questions
and theyre the same ones that i have today
and they are why do things happen and how do things happen
and the one my mother asked how do i make things happen
its a wonderful way to look at these questions when you write a story
because after all in that framework between page one and you have to answer this question of why things happen how things happen in what order they happen what are the influences
how do i as the narrator as the writer also influence that
and its also one that i think many of our scientists have been asking
its a kind of cosmology and i have to develop a cosmology of my own universe as the creator of that universe
and you see theres a lot of back and forth in trying to make that happen trying to figure it out years and years oftentimes
so when i look at creativity i also think that it is this sense or this inability to repress my looking at associations in practically anything in life
and i got a lot of them during whats been going on throughout this conference almost everything thats been going on
and so im going to use as the metaphor this association quantum mechanics which i really dont understand but im still gonna use it as the process for explaining how it is the metaphor
so in quantum mechanics of course you have dark energy and dark matter
and its the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen
theres a lot of unknown and you often dont know what it is except by its absence
but when you make those associations you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story and what youre finding is what matters the meaning
and thats what i look for in my work a personal meaning
there is also the uncertainty principle which is part of quantum mechanics as i understand it
and this happens constantly in the writing
and theres the terrible and dreaded observer effect in which youre looking for something and you know things are happening simultaneously and youre looking at it in a different way and youre trying to really look for the about ness or what is this story about and if you try too hard then you will only write the about
you wont discover anything
and what you were supposed to find what you hoped to find in some serendipitous way is no longer there
now i dont want to ignore the other side of what happens in our universe like many of our scientists have
and so i am going to just throw in string theory here and just say that creative people are multidimensional and there are levels i think of anxiety
and they all operate at the same time
there is also a big question of ambiguity
and i would link that to something called the cosmological constant
and you dont know what is operating but something is operating there
and ambiguity to me is very uncomfortable in my life and i have it moral ambiguity
it is constantly there and just as an example this is one that recently came to me
it was something i read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in iraq and she said save a man from drowning you are responsible to him for life
a very famous chinese saying she said
and that means because we went into iraq we should stay there until things were solved you know maybe even years
so there was another one that i came across and its saving fish from drowning
and its what buddhist fishermen say because theyre not supposed to kill anything
and they also have to make a living and people need to be fed
so their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning and unfortunately in the process the fish die
now whats encapsulated in both these drowning metaphors actually one of them is my mothers interpretation and it is a famous chinese saying because she said it to me save a man from drowning you are responsible to him for life
and it was a warning dont get involved in other peoples business or youre going to get stuck
ok i think if somebody really was drowning shed save them
but both of these sayings saving a fish from drowning or saving a man from drowning to me they had to do with intentions
and all of us in life when we see a situation we have a response
and then we have intentions
theres an ambiguity of what that should be that we should do and then we do something
and the results of that may not match what our intentions had been
maybe things go wrong and so after that what are our responsibilities
what are we supposed to do
do we stay in for life or do we do something else and justify and say well my intentions were good and therefore i cannot be held responsible for all of it
that is the ambiguity in my life that really disturbed me and led me to write a book called saving fish from drowning
i saw examples of that once i identified this question it was all over the place
i got these hints everywhere
and then in a way i knew that they had always been there
and then writing thats what happens i get these hints these clues and i realize that theyve been obvious and yet they have not been
and what i need in effect is a focus
and when i have the question it is a focus
and all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through that question and what happens is those particular things become relevant
and it seems like its happening all the time
you think theres a sort of coincidence going on a serendipity in which youre getting all this help from the universe
and it may also be explained that now you have a focus
and you are noticing it more often
but you apply this
you begin to look at things having to do with your tensions
your brother whos fallen in trouble do you take care of him
why or why not
it may be something that is perhaps more serious as i said human rights in burma
i was thinking that i shouldnt go because somebody said if i did it would show that i approved of the military regime there
and then after a while i had to ask myself why do we take on knowledge why do we take on assumptions that other people have given us
and it was the same thing that i felt when i was growing up and was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father who was a baptist minister
so i decided that i would go to burma for my own intentions and still didnt know that if i went there what the result of that would be if i wrote a book and i just would have to face that later when the time came
we are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of
we come to this point and say what do i as an individual do
not all of us can go to africa or work at hospitals so what do we do if we have this moral response this feeling
also i think one of the biggest things we are all looking at and we talked about today is genocide
this leads to this question
when i look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable and i consider what my intentions should be i realize it goes back to this identity question that i had when i was a child and why am i here and what is the meaning of my life and what is my place in the universe
it seems so obvious and yet it is not
we all hate moral ambiguity in some sense and yet it is also absolutely necessary
in writing a story it is the place where i begin
sometimes i get help from the universe it seems
my mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book because it seemed i knew things i was not supposed to know
instead of writing that the grandmother died accidentally from an overdose of opium while having too much of a good time i actually put down in the story that the woman killed herself and that actually was the way it happened
and my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother
there are also things quite uncanny which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book
in this case i was writing a story that included some kind of detail period of history a certain location
and i needed to find something historically that would match that
and i took down this book and i first page that i flipped it to was exactly the setting and the time period and the kind of character i needed was the taiping rebellion happening in the area near guilin outside of that and a character who thought he was the son of god
you wonder are these things random chance
well what is random what is chance what is luck
what are things that you get from the universe that you cant really explain
and that goes into the story too
these are the things i constantly think about from day to day
especially when good things happen and in particular when bad things happen
but i do think theres a kind of serendipity and i do want to know what those elements are so i can thank them and also try to find them in my life
because again i think that when i am aware of them more of them happen
another chance encounter is when i went to a place i just was with some friends and we drove randomly to a different place and we ended up in this non tourist location a beautiful village pristine
and we walked three valleys beyond and the third valley there was something quite mysterious and ominous a discomfort i felt and then i knew that had to be setting of my book
and in writing one of the scenes it happened in that third valley
for some reason i wrote about cairns stacks of rocks that a man was building
and i didnt know exactly why i had it but it was so vivid
i got stuck and a friend when she asked if i would go for a walk with her dogs that i said sure and about minutes later walking along the beach i came across this
and it was a man a chinese man and he was stacking these things not with glue not with anything
and i asked him how is it possible to do this
and he said well i guess with everything in life theres a place of balance
and this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point
i had so many examples i have so many instances like this when im writing a story and i cannot explain it
is it because i had the filter that i have such a strong coincidence in writing about these things
or is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain like the cosmological constant
a big thing that i also think about is accidents
and as i said my mother did not believe in randomness
what is the nature of accidents
and how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are outside of a court of law
i was able to see that in a firsthand way when i went to beautiful dong village in guizhou the poorest province of china
and i saw this beautiful place i knew i wanted to come back
and i had a chance to do that when national geographic asked me if i wanted to write anything about china
and i said yes about this village of singing people singing minority
and they agreed and between the time i saw this place and the next time i went there was a terrible accident a man an old man fell asleep and his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm
homes were destroyed and were damaged
responsibility was assigned to the family
the mans sons were banished to live three kilometers away in a cowshed
and of course as westerners we say well it was an accident thats not fair
its the son not the father
when i go on a story i have to let go of those kinds of beliefs
it takes a while but i have to let go of them and just go there and be there
and so i was there on three occasions different seasons
and i began to sense something different about the history and what had happened before and the nature of life in a very poor village and what you find as your joys and your rituals your traditions your links with other families and i saw how this had a kind of justice in its responsibility
i was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using a ceremony they hadnt used in about years and it was to send some men a feng shui master sent men down to the underworld on ghost horses
now you as westerners and i as westerners would say well thats superstition but after being there for a while and seeing the amazing things that happened you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world determining how things happen
so i remained with them and the more i wrote that story the more i got into those beliefs and i think thats important for me to take on the beliefs because that is where the story is real and that is where im gonna find the answers to how i feel about certain questions that i have in life
years go by of course and the writing it doesnt happen instantly as im trying to convey it to you here at ted
the book comes and it goes when it arrives it is no longer my book
it is in the hands of readers and they interpret it differently
but i go back to this question of how do i create something out of nothing
and how do i create my own life
and i think it is by questioning and saying to myself that there are no absolute truths
i believe in specifics the specifics of story and the past the specifics of that past and what is happening in the story at that point
i also believe that in thinking about things my thinking about luck and fate and coincidences and accidents gods will and the synchrony of mysterious forces i will come to some notion of what that is how we create
i have to think of my role where i am in the universe and did somebody intend for me to be that way or is it just something i came up with
and i also can find that by imagining fully and becoming what is imagined and yet is in that real world the fictional world
and that is how i find particles of truth not the absolute truth or the whole truth
and they have to be in all possibilities including those i never considered before
so there are never complete answers
or rather if there is an answer it is to remind myself that there is uncertainty in everything and that is good because then i will discover something new
and if there is a partial answer a more complete answer from me it is to simply imagine
and to imagine is to put myself in that story until there was only there is a transparency between me and the story that i am creating
and thats how ive discovered that if i feel what is in the story in one story then i come the closest i think to knowing what compassion is to feeling that compassion
because for everything in that question of how things happen it has to do with the feeling
i have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that
weve come to the end of the talk and i will reveal what is in the bag and it is the muse and it is the things that transform in our lives that are wonderful and stay with us
there she is
thank you very much

title andrew fitzgerald adventures in twitter fiction title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript in the broadcast radio introduced an entirely new form of storytelling today micro blogging platforms like twitter are changing the scene again andrew fitzgerald takes a look at the short but fascinating history of new forms of creative experimentation in fiction and storytelling description
so in my free time outside of twitter i experiment a little bit with telling stories online experimenting with what we can do with new digital tools
and in my job at twitter i actually spent a little bit of time working with authors and storytellers as well helping to expand out the bounds and i want to talk through some examples today of things that people have done that i think are really fascinating using flexible identity and anonymity on the web and blurring the lines between fact and fiction
but i want to start and go back to the
long before a little thing called twitter radio brought us broadcasts and connected millions of people to single points of broadcast
and from those single points emanated stories
and for a while they were familiar formats but then radio began to evolve its own unique formats specific to that medium
think about episodes that happened live on radio
combining the live play and the serialization of written fiction you get this new format
and the reason why i bring up radio is that i think radio is a great example of how a new medium defines new formats which then define new stories
and of course today we have an entirely new medium to play with which is this online world
this is the map of verified users on twitter and the connections between them
there are thousands upon thousands of them
every single one of these points is its own broadcaster
weve gone to this world of many to many where access to the tools is the only barrier to broadcasting
and i think that we should start to see wildly new formats emerge as people learn how to tell stories in this new medium
i actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier for creative experimentation if you will that weve explored and begun to settle this wild land of the internet and are now just getting ready to start to build structures on it and those structures are the new formats of storytelling that the internet will allow us to create
i believe this starts with an evolution of existing methods
the short story for example people are saying that the short story is experiencing a renaissance of sorts thanks to e readers digital marketplaces
one writer hugh howey experimented with short stories on amazon by releasing one very short story called wool
and he actually says that he didnt intend for wool to become a series but that the audience loved the first story so much they demanded more and so he gave them more
he gave them wool which was a little bit longer than the first one wool which was even longer culminating in wool which was a word novel
i think howey was able to do all of this because he had the quick feedback system of e books
he was able to write and publish in relatively short order
there was no mediator between him and the audience
it was just him directly connected with his audience and building on the feedback and enthusiasm that they were giving him
so this whole project was an experiment
it started with the one short story and i think the experimentation actually became a part of howeys format
and thats something that this medium enabled was experimentation being a part of the format itself
this is a short story by the author jennifer egan called black box
it was originally written specifically with twitter in mind
egan convinced the new yorker to start a new yorker fiction account from which they could tweet all of these lines that she created
now twitter of course has a character limit
egan mocked that up just writing manually in this storyboard sketchbook used the physical space constraints of those storyboard squares to write each individual tweet and those tweets ended up becoming over of them that were serialized by the new yorker
every night at p m you could tune in to a short story from the new yorkers fiction account
i think thats pretty exciting tune in literary fiction
the experience of egans story of course like anything on twitter there were multiple ways to experience it
you could scroll back through it but interestingly if you were watching it live there was this suspense that built because the actual tweets you had no control over when you would read them
they were coming at a pretty regular clip but as the story was building normally as a reader you control how fast you move through a text but in this case the new yorker did and they were sending you bit by bit by bit and you had this suspense of waiting for the next line
another great example of fiction and the short story on twitter elliott holt is an author who wrote a story called evidence
it began with this tweet on november at p m a woman identified as miranda brown of brooklyn fell to her death from the roof of a manhattan hotel
it begins in elliotts voice but then elliotts voice recedes and we hear the voices of elsa margot and simon characters that elliott created on twitter specifically to tell this story a story from multiple perspectives leading up to this moment at p m
when this woman falls to her death
these three characters brought an authentic vision from multiple perspectives
one reviewer called elliotts story twitter fiction done right because she did
she captured that voice and she had multiple characters and it happened in real time
interestingly though it wasnt just twitter as a distribution mechanism
it was also twitter as a production mechanism
elliott told me later she wrote the whole thing with her thumbs
she laid on the couch and just went back and forth between different characters tweeting out each line line by line
i think that this kind of spontaneous creation of what was coming out of the characters voices really lent an authenticity to the characters themselves but also to this format that she had created of multiple perspectives in a single story on twitter
as you begin to play with flexible identity online it gets even more interesting as you start to interact with the real world
things like invisible obama or the famous binders full of women that came up during the election cycle or even the fan fiction universe of west wing twitter in which you have all of these accounts for every single one of the characters in the west wing including the bird that taps at josh lymans window in one single episode
all of these are rapid iterations on a theme
they are creative people experimenting with the bounds of what is possible in this medium
you look at something like west wing twitter in which you have these fictional characters that engage with the real world
they comment on politics they cry out against the evils of congress
keep in mind theyre all democrats
and they engage with the real world
they respond to it
so once you take flexible identity anonymity engagement with the real world and you move beyond simple homage or parody and you put these tools to work in telling a story thats when things get really interesting
so during the chicago mayoral election there was a parody account
it was mayor emanuel
it gave you everything you wanted from rahm emanuel particularly in the expletive department
this foul mouthed account followed the daily activities of the race providing commentary as it went
it followed all of the natural tropes of a good solid twitter parody account but then started to get weird
and as it progressed it moved from this commentary to a multi week real time science fiction epic in which your protagonist rahm emanuel engages in multi dimensional travel on election day which is it didnt actually happen
i double checked the newspapers
and then very interestingly it came to an end
this is something that doesnt usually happen with a twitter parody account
it ended a true narrative conclusion
and so the author dan sinker who was a journalist who was completely anonymous this whole time i think dan it made a lot of sense for him to turn this into a book because it was a narrative format in the end and i think that turning it into a book is representative of this idea that he had created something new that needed to be translated into previous formats
one of my favorite examples of something thats happening on twitter right now actually is the very absurdist crimer show
crimer show tells the story of a supercriminal and a hapless detective that face off in this exceptionally strange lingo with all of the tropes of a television show
crimer shows creator has said that it is a parody of a popular type of show in the u k but man is it weird
and there are all these times where crimer the supercriminal does all of these tv things
hes always taking off his sunglasses or turning to the camera but these things just happen in text
i think borrowing all of these tropes from television and additionally presenting each crimer show as an episode spelled e p p a s o d eppasod presenting them as episodes really it creates something new
there is a new eppasod of crimer show on twitter pretty much every day and theyre archived that way
and i think this is an interesting experiment in format
something totally new has been created here out of parodying something on television
i think in nonfiction real time storytelling there are a lot of really excellent examples as well
realtimewwii is an account that documents what was happening on this day years ago in exceptional detail as if you were reading the news reports from that day
and the author teju cole has done a lot of experimentation with putting a literary twist on events of the news
in this particular case hes talking about drone strikes
i think that in both of these examples youre beginning to see ways in which people are telling stories with nonfiction content that can be built into new types of fictional storytelling
so with real time storytelling blurring the lines between fact and fiction the real world and the digital world flexible identity anonymity these are all tools that we have accessible to us and i think that theyre just the building blocks
they are the bits that we use to create the structures the frames that then become our settlements on this wide open frontier for creative experimentation
thank you

title ananda shankar jayant fighting cancer with dance title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript renowned classical indian dancer ananda shankar jayant was diagnosed with cancer in she tells her personal story of not only facing the disease but dancing through it and gives a performance revealing the metaphor of strength that helped her do it description
this is an ode to the mother goddess that most of us in india learn when we are children
i learned it when i was four at my mothers knee
that year she introduced me to dance and thus began my tryst with classical dance
since then its been four decades now ive trained with the best in the field performed across the globe taught young and old alike created collaborated choreographed and wove a rich tapestry of artistry achievement and awards
the crowning glory was in when i received this countrys fourth highest civilian award the padma shri for my contribution to art
but nothing nothing prepared me for what i was to hear on the first of july
i heard the word carcinoma
yes breast cancer
as i sat dumbstruck in my doctors office i heard other words cancer stage grade
until then cancer was the zodiac sign of my friend stage was what i performed on and grades were what i got in school
that day i realized i had an unwelcome uninvited new life partner
as a dancer i know the nine rasas or the navarasas anger valor disgust humor and fear
i thought i knew what fear was
that day i learned what fear was
overcome with the enormity of it all and the complete feeling of loss of control i shed copious tears and asked my dear husband jayant
i said is this it is this the end of the road
is this the end of my dance
and he the positive soul that he is said no this is just a hiatus a hiatus during the treatment and youll get back to doing what you do best
i realized then that i who thought i had complete control of my life had control of only three things my thought my mind the images that these thoughts created and the action that derived from it
so here i was wallowing in a vortex of emotions and depression and what have you with the enormity of the situation wanting to go to a place of healing health and happiness
i wanted to go from where i was to where i wanted to be for which i needed something
i needed something that would pull me out of all this
so i dried my tears and i declared to the world at large
i said cancers only one page in my life and i will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life
i also declared to the world at large that i would ride it out and i would not allow cancer to ride me
but to go from where i was to where i wanted to be i needed something
i needed an anchor an image a peg to peg this process on so that i could go from there
and i found that in my dance my dance my strength my energy my passion my very life breath
but it wasnt easy
believe me it definitely wasnt easy
how do you keep cheer when you go from beautiful to bald in three days
how do you not despair when with the body ravaged by chemotherapy climbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture that to someone like me who could dance for three hours
how do you not get overwhelmed by the despair and the misery of it all
all i wanted to do was curl up and weep
but i kept telling myself fear and tears are options i did not have
so i would drag myself into my dance studio body mind and spirit every day into my dance studio and learn everything i learned when i was four all over again reworked relearned regrouped
it was excruciatingly painful but i did it
difficult
i focused on my mudras on the imagery of my dance on the poetry and the metaphor and the philosophy of the dance itself
and slowly i moved out of that miserable state of mind
but i needed something else
i needed something to go that extra mile and i found it in that metaphor which i had learned from my mother when i was four
the metaphor of mahishasura mardhini of durga
durga the mother goddess the fearless one created by the pantheon of hindu gods
durga resplendent bedecked beautiful her arms ready for warfare as she rode astride her lion into the battlefield to destroy mahishasur
durga the epitome of creative feminine energy or shakti
durga the fearless one
i made that image of durga and her every attribute her every nuance my very own
powered by the symbology of a myth and the passion of my training i brought laser sharp focus into my dance laser sharp focus to such an extent that i danced a few weeks after surgery
i danced through chemo and radiation cycles much to the dismay of my oncologist
i danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule
what i had done is i had tuned out of cancer and tuned into my dance
yes cancer has just been one page in my life
my story is a story of overcoming setbacks obstacles and challenges that life throws at you
my story is the power of thought
my story is the power of choice
its the power of focus
its the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so animates you so moves you that something even like cancer becomes insignificant
my story is the power of a metaphor
its the power of an image
mine was that of durga durga the fearless one
she was also called simhanandini the one who rode the lion
as i ride out as i ride my own inner strength my own inner resilience armed as i am with what medication can provide and continue treatment as i ride out into the battlefield of cancer asking my rogue cells to behave i want to be known not as a cancer survivor but as a cancer conqueror
i present to you an excerpt of that work simhanandini

title spencer wells a family tree for humanity title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript all humans share some common bits of dna passed down to us from our african ancestors geneticist spencer wells talks about how his genographic project will use this shared dna to figure out how we are in all our diversity truly connected description
jambo bonjour zdravstvujtye dayo these are a few of the languages that ive spoken little bits of over the course of the last six weeks as ive been to countries i think im up to on this crazy tour ive been doing checking out various aspects of the project that were doing
and im going to tell you a little bit about later on
and visiting some pretty incredible places places like mongolia cambodia new guinea south africa tanzania twice i was here a month ago
and the opportunity to make a whirlwind tour of the world like that is utterly amazing for lots of reasons
you see some incredible stuff
and you get to make these spot comparisons between people all around the globe
and the thing that you really take away from that the kind of surface thing that you take away from it is not that were all one although im going to tell you about that but rather how different we are
there is so much diversity around the globe
different languages spoken by six and a half billion people all different colors shapes sizes
you walk down the street in any big city you travel like that and you are amazed at the diversity in the human species
how do we explain that diversity
well thats what im going to talk about today is how were using the tools of genetics population genetics in particular to tell us how we generated this diversity and how long it took
now the problem of human diversity like all big scientific questions how do you explain something like that can be broken down into sub questions
and you can ferret away at those little sub questions
first one is really a question of origins
do we all share a common origin in fact
and given that we do and thats the assumption everybody i think in this room would make when was that
when did we originate as a species
how long have we been divergent from each other
and the second question is related but slightly different
if we do spring from a common source how did we come to occupy every corner of the globe and in the process generate all of this diversity the different ways of life the different appearances the different languages around the world
well the question of origins as with so many other questions in biology seems to have been answered by darwin over a century ago
in the descent of man he wrote in each great region of the world the living mammals are closely related to the extinct species of the same region
its therefore probable that africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee and as these two species are now mans nearest allies its somewhat more probable that our early progenitors lived on the african continent than elsewhere
so were done we can go home finished the origin question
well not quite because darwin was talking about our distant ancestry our common ancestry with apes
and it is quite clear that apes originated on the african continent
around million years ago they appear in the fossil record
africa was actually disconnected from the other landmasses at that time due to the vagaries of plate tectonics floating around the indian ocean
bumped into eurasia around million years ago and then we had the first african exodus as we call it
the apes that left at that time ended up in southeast asia became the gibbons and the orangutans
and the ones that stayed on in africa evolved into the gorillas the chimpanzees and us
so yes if youre talking about our common ancestry with apes its very clear by looking at the fossil record we started off here
but thats not really the question im asking
im asking about our human ancestry things that we would recognize as being like us if they were sitting here in the room
if they were peering over your shoulder you wouldnt leap back like that what about our human ancestry
because if we go far enough back we share a common ancestry with every living thing on earth
dna ties us all together so we share ancestry with barracuda and bacteria and mushrooms if you go far enough back over a billion years
what were asking about though is human ancestry
how do we study that
well historically it has been studied using the science of paleoanthropology
digging things up out of the ground and largely on the basis of morphology the way things are shaped often skull shape saying this looks a little bit more like us than that so this must be my ancestor
this must be who im directly descended from
the field of paleoanthropology ill argue gives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry but it doesnt give us the probabilities that we really want as scientists
what do i mean by that
youre looking at a great example here
these are three extinct species of hominids potential human ancestors
all dug up just west of here in olduvai gorge by the leakey family
and theyre all dating to roughly the same time
from left to right weve got homo erectus homo habilis and australopithecus now called paranthropus boisei the robust australopithecine three extinct species same place same time
that means that not all three could be my direct ancestor
which one of these guys am i actually related to
possibilities about our ancestry but not the probabilities that were really looking for
well a different approach has been to look at morphology in humans using the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently again largely skull shape
the first person to do this systematically was linnaeus carl von linne a swedish botanist who in the eighteenth century took it upon himself to categorize every living organism on the planet
you think youve got a tough job
and he did a pretty good job
he categorized about species in systema naturae
he actually coined the term homo sapiens it means wise man in latin
but looking around the world at the diversity of humans he said well you know we seem to come in discreet sub species or categories
and he talked about africans and americans and asians and europeans and a blatantly racist category he termed monstrosus which basically included all the people he didnt like including imaginary folk like elves
its easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well intentioned but ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist working in the pre darwinian era
except if you had taken physical anthropology as recently as or years ago in many cases you would have learned basically that same classification of humanity
human races that according to physical anthropologists of years ago carlton coon is the best example had been diverging from each other this was in the post darwinian era for over a million years since the time of homo erectus
but based on what data
very little very little morphology and a lot of guesswork
well what im going to talk about today what im going to talk about now is a new approach to this problem
instead of going out and guessing about our ancestry digging things up out of the ground possible ancestors and saying it on the basis of morphology which we still dont completely understand we dont know the genetic causes underlying this morphological variation what we need to do is turn the problem on its head
because what were really asking is a genealogical problem or a genealogical question
what were trying to do is construct a family tree for everybody alive today
and as any genealogist will tell you anybody have a member of the family or maybe you have tried to construct a family tree trace back in time
you start in the present with relationships youre certain about
you and your siblings you have a parent in common
you and your cousins share a grandparent in common
you gradually trace further and further back into the past adding these ever more distant relationships
but eventually no matter how good you are at digging up the church records and all that stuff you hit what the genealogists call a brick wall
a point beyond which you dont know anything else about your ancestors and you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history that we have to feel our way through with whispered guidance
who were these people who came before
we have no written record well actually we do
written in our dna in our genetic code we have a historical document that takes us back in time to the very earliest days of our species and thats what we study
now a quick primer on dna
i suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist
it is a very long linear molecule a coded version of how to make another copy of you its your blueprint
its composed of four subunits a c g and t we call them
and its the sequence of those subunits that defines that blueprint
how long is it well its billions of these subunits in length
a haploid genome we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes a haploid genome is around billion nucleotides in length
and the whole thing if you add it all together is over six billion nucleotides long
if you take all the dna out of one cell in your body and stretch it end to end its around two meters long
if you take all the dna out of every cell in your body and you stretch it end to end it would reach from here to the moon and back thousands of times its a lot of information
and so when youre copying this dna molecule to pass it on its a pretty tough job
imagine the longest book you can think of war and peace
now multiply it by
and imagine copying that by hand
and youre working away until late at night and youre very very careful and youre drinking coffee and youre paying attention but occasionally when youre copying this by hand youre going to make a little typo a spelling mistake substitute an i for an e or a c for a t
same thing happens to our dna as its being passed on through the generations
it doesnt happen very often we have a proofreading mechanism built in
but when it does happen and these changes get transmitted down through the generations they become markers of descent
if you share a marker with someone it means you share an ancestor at some point in the past the person who first had that change in their dna
and its by looking at the pattern of genetic variation the pattern of these markers in people all over the world and assessing the relative ages when they occurred throughout our history that weve been able to construct a family tree for everybody alive today
these are two pieces of dna that we use quite widely in our work
mitochondrial dna tracing a purely maternal line of descent
you get your mtdna from your mother and your mothers mother all the way back to the very first woman
the y chromosome the piece of dna that makes men men traces a purely paternal line of descent
everybody in this room everybody in the world falls into a lineage somewhere on these trees
now even though these are simplified versions of the real trees theyre still kind of complicated so lets simplify them
turn them on their sides combine them so that they look like a tree with the root at the bottom and the branches going up
whats the take home message
well the thing that jumps out at you first is that the deepest lineages in our family trees are found within africa among africans
that means that africans have been accumulating this mutational diversity for longer
and what that means is that we originated in africa its written in our dna
every piece of dna we look at has greater diversity within africa than outside of africa
and at some point in the past a sub group of africans left the african continent to go out and populate the rest of the world
now how recently do we share this ancestry
was it millions of years ago which we might suspect by looking at all this incredible variation around the world
no the dna tells a story thats very clear
within the last years we all share an ancestor a single person mitochondrial eve you might have heard about her in africa an african woman who gave rise to all the mitochondrial diversity in the world today
but whats even more amazing is that if you look at the y chromosome side the male side of the story the y chromosome adam only lived around years ago
thats only about human generations the blink of an eye in an evolutionary sense
that tells us we were all still living in africa at that time
this was an african man who gave rise to all the y chromosome diversity around the world
its only within the last years that we have started to generate this incredible diversity we see around the world
such an amazing story
were all effectively part of an extended african family
now that seems so recent why didnt we start to leave earlier
why didnt homo erectus evolve into separate species or sub species rather human races around the world
why was it that we seem to have come out of africa so recently
well thats a big question these why questions particularly in genetics and the study of history in general are always the big ones the ones that are tough to answer
and so when all else fails talk about the weather
what was going on to the worlds weather around years ago
well we were going into the worst part of the last ice age
the last ice age started roughly years ago
it went up and down and it really started to accelerate around years ago
lots of evidence from sediment cores and the pollen types oxygen isotopes and so on
we hit the last glacial maximum around years ago but basically from years on things were getting really tough getting very cold the northern hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets
new york city chicago seattle all under a sheet of ice
most of britain all of scandinavia covered by ice several kilometers thick
now africa is the most tropical continent on the planet about percent of it lies between cancer and capricorn and there arent a lot of glaciers here except on the high mountains here in east africa
so what was going on here we werent covered in ice in africa
rather africa was drying out at that time
this is a paleo climatological map of what africa looked like between and years ago reconstructed from all these pieces of evidence that i mentioned before
the reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere
if you think about antarctica its technically a desert it gets so little precipitation
so the whole world was drying out
the sea levels were dropping and africa was turning to desert
the sahara was much bigger then than it is now
and the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets compared to what we have today
the evidence from genetic data is that the human population around this time roughly years ago crashed to fewer than individuals
we nearly went extinct we were hanging on by our fingernails
and then something happened a great illustration of it
look at some stone tools
the ones on the left are from africa from around a million years ago
the ones on the right were made by neanderthals our distant cousins not our direct ancestors living in europe and they date from around or years ago
now at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists or physical anthropologists in the audience basically theres not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups
the ones on the left are pretty similar to the ones on the right
we are in a period of long cultural stasis from a million years ago until around to years ago
the tool styles dont change that much
the evidence is that the human way of life didnt change that much during that period
but then thousand years ago somewhere in that region all hell breaks loose art makes its appearance
the stone tools become much more finely crafted
the evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species at particular times of the year
the population size started to expand
probably according to what many linguists believe fully modern language syntactic language subject verb object that we use to convey complex ideas like im doing now appeared around that time
we became much more social the social networks expanded
this change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in africa and they allowed us to start to expand around the world
weve been talking at this conference about african success stories
well you want the ultimate african success story
look in the mirror youre it the reason youre alive today is because of those changes in our brains that took place in africa probably somewhere in the region where were sitting right now around thousand years ago allowing us not only to survive in africa but to expand out of africa
an early coastal migration along the south coast of asia leaving africa around years ago reaching australia very rapidly by years ago
a slightly later migration up into the middle east
these would have been savannah hunters
so those of you who are going on one of the post conference tours youll get to see what a real savannah is like
and its basically a meat locker
people who would have specialized in killing the animals hunting the animals on those meat locker savannahs moving up following the grasslands into the middle east around years ago during one of the rare wet phases in the sahara
migrating eastward following the grasslands because thats what they were adapted to live on
and when they reached central asia they reached what was effectively a steppe super highway a grassland super highway
the grasslands at that time this was during the last ice age stretched basically from germany all the way over to korea and the entire continent was open to them
entering europe around years ago and finally a small group migrating up through the worst weather imaginable siberia inside the arctic circle during the last ice age temperature was at even perhaps migrating into the americas ultimately reaching that final frontier
an amazing story and it happened first in africa
the changes that allowed us to do that the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us allowing us to create novel cultures allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one ive just been on
now that story i just told you is literally a whirlwind tour of how we populated the world the great paleolithic wanderings of our species
and thats the story that i told a couple of years ago in my book the journey of man and a film that we made with the same title
and as we were finishing up that film it was co produced with national geographic i started talking to the folks at ng about this work
and they got really excited about it they liked the film but they said you know we really see this as kind of the next wave in the study of human origins where we all came from using the tools of dna to map the migrations around the world
you know the study of human origins is kind of in our dna and we want to take it to the next level
what do you want to do next
which is a great question to be asked by national geographic
and i said well you know what ive sketched out here is just that
it is a very coarse sketch of how we migrated around the planet
and its based on a few thousand people weve sampled from you know a handful of populations around the world
studied a few genetic markers and there are lots of gaps on this map
weve just connected the dots what we need to do is increase our sample size by an order of magnitude or more hundreds of thousands of dna samples from people all over the world
and that was the genesis of the genographic project
the project launched in april
it has three core components obviously science is a big part of it
the field research that were doing around the world with indigenous peoples
people who have lived in the same location for a long period of time retain a connection to the place where they live that many of the rest of us have lost
so my ancestors come from all over northern europe
i live in the eastern seaboard of north america when im not traveling
where am i indigenous to nowhere really my genes are all jumbled up
but there are people who retain that link to their ancestors that allows us to contextualize the dna results
thats the focus of the field research the centers that weve set up all over the world of them top population geneticists
but in addition we wanted to open up this study to anybody around the world
how often do you get to participate in a big scientific project
the human genome project or a mars rover mission
in this case you actually can
you can go onto our website nationalgeographic com genographic
you can order a kit you can test your own dna
and you can actually submit those results to the database and tell us a little about your genealogical background have the data analyzed as part of the scientific effort
now this is all a nonprofit enterprise and so the money that we raise after we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components gets plowed back into the project
the majority going to something we call the legacy fund
its a charitable entity basically a grant giving entity that gives money back to indigenous groups around the world for educational cultural projects initiated by them
they apply to this fund in order to do various projects and ill show you a couple of examples
so how are we doing on the project weve got about samples collected from indigenous people around the world
the most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public people have ordered these participation kits since we launched two years ago which has raised around five million dollars the majority of which at least half is going back into the legacy fund
weve just awarded the first legacy grants totaling around dollars
projects around the world documenting oral poetry in sierra leone preserving traditional weaving patterns in gaza language revitalization in tajikistan etc etc
so the project is going very very well and i urge you to check out the website and watch this space
thank you very much

ive been playing ted for nearly a decade and ive very rarely played any new songs of my own
and that was largely because there werent any
so ive been busy with a couple of projects and one of them was this the nutmeg
a ships lifeboat which ive been restoring in the garden of my beach house in england
and so now when the polar ice caps melt my recording studio will rise up like an ark and ill float off into the drowned world like a character from a j g ballard novel
during the day the nutmeg collects energy from solar panels on the roof of the wheelhouse and from a watt turbine up the mast
so that when it gets dark ive got plenty of power
and i can light up the nutmeg like a beacon
and so i go in there until the early hours of the morning and i work on new songs
id like to play to you guys if youre willing to be the first audience to hear it
its about billie holiday
and it appears that some night in she left her physical space and was missing all night until she reappeared in the morning
but i know where she was
she was with me on my lifeboat

title jeremy gilley one day of peace title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript heres a crazy idea persuade the world to try living in peace for just one day every september in this energetic honest talk jeremy gilley tells the story of how this crazy idea became real real enough to help millions of kids in war torn regions description
i was basically concerned about what was going on in the world
i couldnt understand the starvation the destruction the killing of innocent people
making sense of those things is a very difficult thing to do
and when i was i became an actor
i was bottom of the class i havent got any qualifications
i was told i was dyslexic
in fact i have got qualifications
i got a d in pottery which was the one thing that i did get which was useful obviously
and so concern is where all of this comes from
and then being an actor i was doing these different kinds of things and i felt the content of the work that i was involved in really wasnt cutting it that there surely had to be more
and at that point i read a book by frank barnaby this wonderful nuclear physicist and he said that media had a responsibility that all sectors of society had a responsibility to try and progress things and move things forward
and that fascinated me because id been messing around with a camera most of my life
and then i thought well maybe i could do something
maybe i could become a filmmaker
maybe i can use the form of film constructively to in some way make a difference
maybe theres a little change i can get involved in
so i started thinking about peace and i was obviously as i said to you very much moved by these images trying to make sense of that
could i go and speak to older and wiser people who would tell me how they made sense of the things that are going on
because its obviously incredibly frightening
but i realized that having been messing around with structure as an actor that a series of sound bites in itself wasnt enough that there needed to be a mountain to climb there needed to be a journey that i had to take
and if i took that journey no matter whether it failed or succeeded it would be completely irrelevant
the point was that i would have something to hook the questions of is humankind fundamentally evil
is the destruction of the world inevitable should i have children
is that a responsible thing to do etc etc
so i was thinking about peace and then i was thinking well wheres the starting point for peace
and that was when i had the idea
there was no starting point for peace
there was no day of global unity
there was no day of intercultural cooperation
there was no day when humanity came together separate in all of those things and just shared it together that were in this together and that if we united and we interculturally cooperated then that might be the key to humanitys survival
that might shift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues that humanity faces if we did it just for a day
so obviously we didnt have any money
i was living at my moms place
and we started writing letters to everybody
you very quickly work out what is it that youve got to do to fathom that out
how do you create a day voted by every single head of state in the world to create the first ever ceasefire nonviolence day the of september
and i wanted it to be the of september because it was my granddads favorite number
he was a prisoner of war
he saw the bomb go off at nagasaki
it poisoned his blood he died when i was
so he was like my hero
and the reason why was the number is men left came back two died on the boat and hit the ground
and thats why we wanted it to be the of september as the date of peace
so we began this journey and we launched it in
and we wrote to heads of state their ambassadors nobel peace laureates ngos faiths various organizations literally wrote to everybody
and very quickly some letters started coming back
and we started to build this case
and i remember the first letter
one of the first letters was from the dalai lama
and of course we didnt have the money we were playing guitars and getting the money for the stamps that we were sending out all of
a letter came through from the dalai lama saying this is an amazing thing come and see me
id love to talk to you about the first ever day of peace
and we didnt have money for the flight
and i rang sir bob ayling who was ceo of ba at the time and said mate weve got this invitation
could you give me a flight because were going to go see him
and of course we went and saw him and it was amazing
and then dr oscar arias came forward
and actually let me go back to that slide because when we launched it in this idea to create the first ever day of ceasefire and non violence we invited thousands of people
well not thousands hundreds of people lots of people all the press because we were going to try and create the first ever world peace day a peace day
and we invited everybody and no press showed up
there were people there they were mostly my friends and family
and that was kind of like the launch of this thing
but it didnt matter because we were documenting and that was the thing
for me it was really about the process
it wasnt about the end result
and thats the beautiful thing about the camera
they used to say the pen is mightier than the sword i think the camera is
and just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing and really empowering actually
so anyway we began the journey
and here you see people like mary robinson i went to see in geneva
im cutting my hair its getting short and long because every time i saw kofi annan i was so worried that he thought i was a hippie that i cut it and that was kind of what was going on
yeah im not worried about it now
so mary robinson she said to me listen this is an idea whose time has come this must be created
kofi annan said this will be beneficial to my troops on the ground
the oau at the time led by salim ahmed salim said i must get the african countries involved
dr oscar arias nobel peace laureate president now of costa rica said ill do everything that i can
so i went and saw amr moussa at the league of arab states
i met mandela at the arusha peace talks and so on and so on and so on while i was building the case to prove whether this idea would make sense
and then we were listening to the people we were documenting everywhere
countries in the last years ive visited
and ive always spoken to women and children wherever ive gone
ive recorded young people
ive recorded about hours of their thoughts
im really clear about how young people feel when you talk to them about this idea of having a starting point for their actions for a more peaceful world through their poetry their art their literature their music their sport whatever it might be
and we were listening to everybody
and it was an incredibly thing working with the u n
and working with ngos and building this case
i felt that i was presenting a case on behalf of the global community to try and create this day
and the stronger the case and the more detailed it was the better chance we had of creating this day
and it was this stuff this where i actually was in the beginning kind of thinking no matter what happened it didnt actually matter
it didnt matter if it didnt create a day of peace
the fact is that if i tried and it didnt work then i could make a statement about how unwilling the global community is to unite until it was in somalia picking up that young girl
and this young child whod taken about an inch and a half out of her leg with no antiseptic and that young boy who was a child soldier who told me hed killed people he was about these things made me realize that this was not a film that i could just stop
and that actually at that moment something happened to me which obviously made me go im going to document
if this is the only film that i ever make im going to document until this becomes a reality
because weve got to stop weve got to do something where we unite separate from all the politics and religion that as a young person is confusing me
i dont know how to get involved in that process
and then on the seventh of september i was invited to new york
the costa rican government and the british government had put forward to the united nations general assembly with co sponsors the idea of the first ever ceasefire nonviolence day the of september as a fixed calendar date and it was unanimously adopted by every head of state in the world
yeah but there were hundreds of individuals obviously who made that a reality
and thank you to all of them
that was an incredible moment
i was at the top of the general assembly just looking down into it and seeing it happen
and as i mentioned when it started we were at the globe and there was no press
and now i was thinking well the press it really going to hear this story
and suddenly we started to institutionalize this day
kofi annan invited me on the morning of september the to do a press conference
and it was am when i stood there
and i was waiting for him to come down and i knew that he was on his way
and obviously he never came down the statement was never made
the world was never told there was a day of global ceasefire and nonviolence
and it was obviously a tragic moment for the thousands of people who lost their lives there and then subsequently all over the world
it never happened
and i remember thinking this is exactly why actually we have to work even harder
and we have to make this day work
its been created nobody knows
but we have to continue this journey and we have to tell people and we have to prove it can work
and i left new york freaked but actually empowered
and i felt inspired by the possibilities that if it did then maybe we wouldnt see things like that
i remember putting that film out and going to cynics
i was showing the film and i remember being in israel and getting it absolutely slaughtered by some guys having watched the film that its just a day of peace it doesnt mean anything
its not going to work youre not going to stop the fighting in afghanistan the taliban wont listen etc etc
its just symbolism
and that was even worse than actually what had just happened in many ways because it couldnt not work
id spoken in somalia burundi gaza the west bank india sri lanka congo wherever it was and theyd all tell me if you can create a window of opportunity we can move aid we can vaccinate children
children can lead their projects
they can unite they can come together if people would stop lives will be saved
thats what id heard
and id heard that from the people who really understood what conflict was about
and so i went back to the united nations
i decided that id continue filming and make another movie
and i went back to the u n for another couple of years
we started moving around the corridors of the u n system governments and ngos trying desperately to find somebody to come forward and have a go at it see if we could make it possible
and after lots and lots of meetings obviously im delighted that this man ahmad fawzi one of my heroes and mentors really he managed to get unicef involved
and unicef god bless them they said okay well have a go
and then unama became involved in afghanistan
it was historical could it work in afghanistan with unama and who and civil society etc etc etc
and i was getting it all on film and i was recording it and i was thinking this is it this is the possibility of it maybe working
but even if it doesnt at least the door is open and theres a chance
and so i went back to london and i went and saw this chap jude law
and i saw him because he was an actor i was an actor i had a connection to him because we needed to get to the press we needed this attraction we needed the media to be involved
because if we start pumping it up a bit maybe more people would listen and thered be more when we got into certain areas maybe there would be more people interested
and maybe wed be helped financially a little bit more which had been desperately difficult
i wont go into that
so jude said okay ill do some statements for you
while i was filming these statements he said to me where are you going next
i said im going to go to afghanistan he said really
and i could sort of see a little look in his eye of interest
so i said to him do you want to come with me
itd be really interesting if you came
it would help and bring attention
and that attention would help leverage the situation as well as all of the other sides of it
i think theres a number of pillars to success
one is youve got to have a great idea
the other is youve got to have a constituency youve got to have finance and youve got to be able to raise awareness
and actually i could never raise awareness by myself no matter what id achieved
so these guys were absolutely crucial
so he said yes and we found ourselves in afghanistan
it was a really incredible thing that when we landed there i was talking to various people and they were saying to me youve got to get everybody involved here
you cant just expect it to work you have to get out and work
and we did and we traveled around and we spoke to elders we spoke to doctors we spoke to nurses we held press conferences we went out with soldiers we sat down with isaf we sat down with nato we sat down with the u k government
i mean we basically sat down with everybody in and out of schools with ministers of education holding these press conferences which of course now were loaded with press everybody was there
there was an interest in what was going on
this amazing woman fatima gailani was absolutely instrumental in what went on as she was the spokesperson for the resistance against the russians
and her afghan network was just absolutely everywhere
and she was really crucial in getting the message in
and then we went home wed sort of done it
we had to wait now and see what happened
and i got home and i remember one of the team bringing in a letter to me from the taliban
and that letter basically said well observe this day
we will observe this day
we see it as a window of opportunity
and we will not engage were not going to engage
and that meant that humanitarian workers wouldnt be kidnapped or killed
and then suddenly i obviously knew at this point there was a chance
and days later million children were vaccinated against polio as a consequence of everybody stopping
and like the general assembly obviously the most wonderful wonderful moment
and so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together because we had to go back
we put it into dari and pashto we put it in the local dialects
we went back to afghanistan because the next year was coming and we wanted to support
but more importantly we wanted to go back because these people in afghanistan were the heroes
they were the people who believed in peace and the possibilities of it etc etc and they made it real
and we wanted to go back and show them the film and say look you guys made this possible and thank you very much
and we gave the film over
obviously it was shown and it was amazing
and then that year that year this isaf statement from kabul afghanistan september general stanley mcchrystal commander of international security assistance forces in afghanistan announced today isaf will not conduct offensive military operations on the of september
they were saying they would stop
and then there was this other statement that came out from the u n department of security and safety saying that in afghanistan because of this work the violence was down by percent
percent reduction in violence on this day at least
and that completely blew my mind almost more than anything
and i remember being stuck in new york this time because of the volcano which was obviously much less harmful
and i was there thinking about what was going on
and i kept thinking about this percent
percent reduction in violence in what everyone said was completely impossible and you couldnt do
and that made me think that if we can get percent in afghanistan then surely we can get percent reduction everywhere
we have to go for a global truce
we have to utilize this day of ceasefire and nonviolence and go for a global truce go for the largest recorded cessation of hostilities both domestically and internationally ever recorded
thats exactly what we must do
and on the of september this year were going to launch that campaign at the arena to go for that process to try and create the largest recorded cessation of hostilities
and we will utilize all kinds of things have a dance and social media and visiting on facebook and visit the website sign the petition
and its in the six official languages of the united nations
and well globally link with government inter government non government education unions sports
and you can see the education box there
weve got resources at the moment in countries trying to get young people to be the driving force behind the vision of that global truce
and obviously the life saving is increased the concepts help
linking up with the olympics i went and saw seb coe i said london is about truce
ultimately thats what its about
why dont we all team up why dont we bring truce to life
why dont you support the process of the largest ever global truce
well make a new film about this process
well utilize sport and football
on the day of peace theres thousands of football matches all played from the favelas of brazil to wherever it might be
so utilizing all of these ways to inspire individual action
and ultimately we have to try that
we have to work together
and when i stand here in front of all of you and the people who will watch these things im excited on behalf of everybody ive met that there is a possibility that our world could unite that we could come together as one that we could lift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues brought about by individuals
i was with brahimi ambassador brahimi
i think hes one of the most incredible men in relation to international politics in afghanistan in iraq
hes an amazing man
and i sat with him a few weeks ago
and i said to him mr brahimi is this nuts going for a global truce
is this possible is it really possible that we could do this
he said its absolutely possible
i said what would you do
would you go to governments and lobby and use the system
he said no id talk to the individuals
its all about the individuals
its all about you and me
its all about partnerships
its about your constituencies its about your businesses
because together by working together i seriously think we can start to change things
and theres a wonderful man sitting in this audience and i dont know where he is who said to me a few days ago because i did a little rehearsal and he said ive been thinking about this day and imagining it as a square with squares and one of them is white
and it then made me think about a glass of water which is clear
if you put one drop one drop of something in that water itll change it forever
by working together we can create peace one day

title melinda gates what nonprofits can learn from coca cola title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript melinda gates makes a provocative case what can nonprofits learn from mega corporations like coca cola whose global network of marketers and distributors ensures that every remote village wants and can get an ice cold coke maybe this model could work for distributing health care vaccinations sanitation even condoms description
one of my favorite parts of my job at the gates foundation is that i get to travel to the developing world and when i meet the mothers in so many of these remote places im really struck by the things that we have in common
they want what we want for our children and that is for their children to grow up successful to be healthy and to have a successful life
but i also see lots of poverty and its quite jarring both in the scale and the scope of it
my first trip in india i was in a persons home where they had dirt floors no running water no electricity and thats really what i see all over the world
so in short im startled by all the things that they dont have
but i am surprised by one thing that they do have coca cola
coke is everywhere
in fact when i travel to the developing world coke feels ubiquitous
and so when i come back from these trips and im thinking about development and im flying home and im thinking were trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations you know cokes success kind of stops and makes you wonder how is it that they can get coke to these far flung places
if they can do that why cant governments and ngos do the same thing
and im not the first person to ask this question
but i think as a community we still have a lot to learn
its staggering if you think about coca cola
they sell billion servings every single day
thats like every man woman and child on the planet having a serving of coke every week
so why does this matter
well if were going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of millennium development goals that were set as a world we need to learn from the innovators and those innovators come from every single sector
i feel that if we can understand what makes something like coca cola ubiquitous we can apply those lessons then for the public good
cokes success is relevant because if we can analyze it learn from it then we can save lives
so thats why i took a bit of time to study coke
and i think there are really three things we can take away from coca cola
they take real time data and immediately feed it back into the product
they tap into local entrepreneurial talent and they do incredible marketing
so lets start with the data
now coke has a very clear bottom line they report to a set of shareholders they have to turn a profit
so they take the data and they use it to measure progress
they have this very continuous feedback loop
they learn something they put it back into the product they put it back into the market
they have a whole team called knowledge and insight
its a lot like other consumer companies
so if youre running namibia for coca cola and you have a constituencies you know where every can versus bottle of sprite fanta or coke was sold whether it was a corner store a supermarket or a pushcart
so if sales start to drop then the person can identify the problem and address the issue
lets contrast that for a minute to development
in development the evaluation comes at the very end of the project
ive sat in a lot of those meetings and by then it is way too late to use the data
i had somebody from an ngo once describe it to me as bowling in the dark
they said you roll the ball you hear some pins go down
its dark you cant see which one goes down until the lights come on and then you an see your impact
real time data turns on the lights
so whats the second thing that cokes good at
theyre good at tapping into that local entrepreneurial talent
cokes been in africa since but most of the time they couldnt reach the distant markets because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world which was a large truck rolling down the street
and in africa the remote places its hard to find a good road
but coke noticed something they noticed that local people were taking the product buying it in bulk and then reselling it in these hard to reach places
and so they took a bit of time to learn about that
and they decided in that they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs giving them small loans
they set them up as what they called micro distribution centers and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows to sell the product
there are now some of these centers employing about people in africa
in tanzania and uganda they represent percent of cokes sales
lets look at the development side
what is it that governments and ngos can learn from coke
governments and ngos need to tap into that local entrepreneurial talent as well because the locals know how to reach the very hard to serve places their neighbors and they know what motivates them to make change
i think a great example of this is ethiopias new health extension program
the government noticed in ethiopia that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic they were over a days travel away from a health clinic
so if youre in an emergency situation or if youre a mom about to deliver a baby forget it to get to the health care center
they decided that wasnt good enough so they went to india and studied the indian state of kerala that also had a system like this and they adapted it for ethiopia
and in the government of ethiopia started this new system in their own country
they trained health extension workers to deliver care directly to the people
in just five years their ratio went from one worker for every people to one worker for every people
now think about how this can change peoples lives
health extension workers can help with so many things whether its family planning prenatal care immunizations for the children or advising the woman to get to the facility on time for an on time delivery
that is having real impact in a country like ethiopia and its why you see their child mortality numbers coming down percent from to
in ethiopia there are hundreds of thousands of children living because of this health extension worker program
so whats the next step for ethiopia
well theyre already starting talk about this
theyre starting to talk about how do you have the health community workers generate their own ideas
how do you incent them based on the impact that theyre getting out in those remote villages
thats how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent and you unlock peoples potential
the third component of cokes success is marketing
ultimately cokes success depends on one crucial fact and that is that people want a coca cola
now the reason these micro entrepreneurs can sell or make a profit is they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow
so they rely on coca cola in terms of its marketing and whats the secret to their marketing
well its aspirational
it is associated that product with a kind of life that people want to live
so even though its a global company they take a very local approach
cokes global campaign slogan is open happiness
but they localize it
and they dont just guess what makes people happy they go to places like latin america and they realize that happiness there is associated with family life
and in south africa they associate happiness with seriti or community respect
now that played itself out in the world cup campaign
lets listen to this song that coke created for it wavin flag by a somali hip hop artist
knaan ♫ oh oh oh oh oh o oh ♫ ♫ oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ♫ ♫ oh oh oh oh oh o oh ♫ ♫ oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o oh ♫ ♫give you freedom give you fire♫ ♫ give you reason take you higher ♫ ♫ see the champions take the field now ♫ ♫ you define us make us feel proud ♫ ♫ in the streets our heads are lifted ♫ ♫ as we lose our inhibition ♫ ♫ celebration its around us ♫ ♫ every nation all around us ♫ melinda french gates it feels pretty good right
well they didnt stop there they localized it into different languages
and it went number one on the pop chart in countries
it reminds me of a song that i remember from my childhood id like to teach the world to sing that also went number one on the pop charts
both songs have something in common that same appeal of celebration and unity
so how does health and development market
well its based on avoidance not aspirations
im sure youve heard some of these messages
use a condom dont get aids
wash you hands you might not get diarrhea
it doesnt sound anything like wavin flag to me
and i think we make a fundamental mistake we make an assumption that we think that if people need something we dont have to make them want that
and i think thats a mistake
and theres some indications around the world that this is starting to change
one example is sanitation
we know that a million and a half children die a year from diarrhea and a lot of it is because of open defecation
but theres a solution you build a toilet
but what were finding around the world over and over again is if you build a toilet and you leave it there it doesnt get used
people reuse it for a slab for their home
they sometimes store grain in it
ive even seen it used for a chicken coop
but what does marketing really entail that would make a sanitation solution get a result in diarrhea
well you work with the community
you start to talk to them about why open defecation is something that shouldnt be done in the village and they agree to that
but then you take the toilet and you position it as a modern trendy convenience
one state in northern india has gone so far as to link toilets to courtship
and it works look at these headlines
im not kidding
women are refusing to marry men without toilets
no loo no i do
now its not just a funny headline its innovative its an innovative marketing campaign
but more importantly it saves lives
take a look at this this is a room full of young men and my husband bill
and can you guess what the young men are waiting for
theyre waiting to be circumcised
can you you believe that
we know that circumcision reduces hiv infection by percent in men
and when we first heard this result inside the foundation i have to admit bill and i were scratching our heads a little bit and we were saying but whos going to volunteer for this procedure
but it turns out the men do because theyre hearing from their girlfriends that they prefer it and the men also believe it improves their sex life
so if we can start to understand what people really want in health and development we can change communities and we can change whole nations
well why is all of this so important
so lets talk about what happens when this all comes together when you tie the three things together
and polio i think is one of the most powerful examples
weve seen a percent reduction in polio in years
so if you look back to there are about cases of polio on the planet that year
in were down to cases
well how did that happen
lets look at a country like india
they have over a billion people in this country but they have local doctors who report paralysis and clinicians a huge reporting system in chemists
they have two and a half million vaccinators
but let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you
let me tell you the story of shriram an month boy in bihar a northern state in india
this year on august he felt paralysis and on the his parents took him to the doctor
on august and they took a stool sample and by the of august it was confirmed he had type polio
by august a genetic test was done and we knew what strain of polio shriram had
now it could have come from one of two places
it could have come from nepal just to the north across the border or from jharkhand a state just to the south
luckily the genetic testing proved that in fact this strand came north because had it come from the south it would have had a much wider impact in terms of transmission
so many more people would have been affected
so whats the endgame
well on september there was a huge mop up campaign which is what you do in polio
they went out and where shriram lives they vaccinated two million people
so in less than a month we went from one case of paralysis to a targeted vaccination program
and im happy to say only one other person in that area got polio
thats how you keep a huge outbreak from spreading and it shows what can happen when local people have the data in their hands they can save lives
now one of the challenges in polio still is marketing but it might not be what you think
its not the marketing on the ground
its not telling the parents if you see paralysis take your child to the doctor or get your child vaccinated
we have a problem with marketing in the donor community
the nations have been incredibly generous on polio over the last years but were starting to have something called polio fatigue and that is that the donor nations arent willing to fund polio any longer
so by next summer were sighted to run out of money on polio
so we are percent of the way there on this goal and were about to run short of money
and i think that if the marketing were more aspirational if we could focus as a community on how far weve come and how amazing it would be to eradicate this disease we could put polio fatigue and polio behind us
and if we could do that we could stop vaccinating everybody worldwide in all of our countries for polio
and it would only be the second disease ever wiped off the face of the planet
and we are so close
and this victory is so possible
so if cokes marketers came to me and asked me to define happiness id say my vision of happiness is a mother holding healthy baby in her arms
to me that is deep happiness
and so if we can learn lessons from the innovators in every sector then in the future we make together that happiness can be just as ubiquitous as coca cola

title joann kuchera morin stunning data visualization in the allosphere title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript joann kuchera morin demos the allosphere a new way to see hear and interpret scientific data dive into the brain feel electron spin hear the music of the elements and detect previously unseen patterns that could lead to new discoveries description
the allosphere its a three story metal sphere in an echo free chamber
think of the allosphere as a large dynamically varying digital microscope thats connected to a supercomputer
researchers can stand on a bridge suspended inside of the sphere and be completely immersed in their data
imagine if a team of physicists could stand inside of an atom and watch and hear electrons spin
imagine if a group of sculptors could be inside of a lattice of atoms and sculpt with their material
imagine if a team of surgeons could fly into the brain as though it was a world and see tissues as landscapes and hear blood density levels as music
this is some of the research that youre going to see that were undertaking at the allosphere
but first a little bit about this group of artists scientists and engineers that are working together
im a composer orchestrally trained and the inventor of the allosphere
with my visual artist colleagues we map complex mathematical algorithms that unfold in time and space visually and sonically
our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns in the information
and our engineering colleagues are making one of the largest dynamically varying computers in the world for this kind of data exploration
im going to fly you into five research projects in the allosphere that are going to take you from biological macroscopic data all the way down to electron spin
this first project is called the allobrain
and its our attempt to quantify beauty by finding which regions of the brain are interactive while witnessing something beautiful
youre flying through the cortex of my colleagues brain
our narrative here is real fmri data thats mapped visually and sonically
the brain now a world that we can fly through and interact with
you see intelligent computer agents the little rectangles that are flying in the brain with you
theyre mining blood density levels
and theyre reporting them back to you sonically
higher density levels mean more activity in that point of the brain
theyre actually singing these densities to you with higher pitches mapped to higher densities
were now going to move from real biological data to biogenerative algorithms that create artificial nature in our next artistic and scientific installation
in this artistic and scientific installation biogenerative algorithms are helping us to understand self generation and growth very important for simulation in the nanoscaled sciences
for artists were making new worlds that we can uncover and explore
these generative algorithms grow over time and they interact and communicate as a swarm of insects
our researchers are interacting with this data by injecting bacterial code which are computer programs that allow these creatures to grow over time
were going to move now from the biological and the macroscopic world down into the atomic world as we fly into a lattice of atoms
this is real afm atomic force microscope data from my colleagues in the solid state lighting and energy center
theyve discovered a new bond a new material for transparent solar cells
were flying through lattice of atoms oxygen hydrogen and zinc
you view the bond in the triangle
its four blue zinc atoms bonding with one white hydrogen atom
you see the electron flow with the streamlines we as artists have generated for the scientists
this is allowing them to find the bonding nodes in any lattice of atoms
we think it makes a beautiful structural art
the sound that youre hearing are the actual emission spectrums of these atoms
weve mapped them into the audio domain so theyre singing to you
oxygen hydrogen and zinc have their own signature
were going to actually move even further down as we go from this lattice of atoms to one single hydrogen atom
were working with our physicist colleagues that have given us the mathematical calculations of the n dimensional schrödinger equation in time
what youre seeing here right now is a superposition of an electron in the lower three orbitals of a hydrogen atom
youre actually hearing and seeing the electron flow with the lines
the white dots are the probability wave that will show you where the electron is in any given point of time and space in this particular three orbital configuration
in a minute were going to move to a two orbital configuration and youre going to notice a pulsing
and youre going to hear an undulation between the sound
this is actually a light emitter
as the sound starts to pulse and contract our physicists can tell when a photon is going to be emitted
theyre starting to find new mathematical structures in these calculations
and theyre understanding more about quantum mathematics
were going to move even further down and go to one single electron spin
this will be the final project that i show you
our colleagues in the center for quantum computation and spintronics are actually measuring with their lasers decoherence in a single electron spin
weve taken this information and weve made a mathematical model out of it
youre actually seeing and hearing quantum information flow
this is very important for the next step in simulating quantum computers and information technology
so these brief examples that ive shown you give you an idea of the kind of work that were doing at the university of california santa barbara to bring together arts science and engineering into a new age of math science and art
we hope that all of you will come to see the allosphere
inspire us to think of new ways that we can use this unique instrument that weve created at santa barbara
thank you very much

title ben saunders why bother leaving the house title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript explorer ben saunders wants you to go outside not because it s always pleasant and happy but because that s where the meat of life is the juice that we can suck out of our hours and days saunders next outdoor excursion to try to be the first in the world to walk from the coast of antarctica to the south pole and back again description
i essentially drag sledges for a living so it doesnt take an awful lot to flummox me intellectually but im going to read this question from an interview earlier this year philosophically does the constant supply of information steal our ability to imagine or replace our dreams of achieving
after all if it is being done somewhere by someone and we can participate virtually then why bother leaving the house
im usually introduced as a polar explorer
im not sure thats the most progressive or century of job titles but ive spent more than two percent now of my entire life living in a tent inside the arctic circle so i get out of the house a fair bit
and in my nature i guess i am a doer of things more than i am a spectator or a contemplator of things and its that dichotomy the gulf between ideas and action that im going to try and explore briefly
the pithiest answer to the question why
thats been dogging me for the last years was credited certainly to this chap the rakish looking gentleman standing at the back second from the left george lee mallory many of you will know his name
in he was last seen disappearing into the clouds near the summit of mt everest
he may or may not have been the first person to climb everest more than years before edmund hillary
no one knows if he got to the top its still a mystery
but he was credited with coining the phrase because its there
now im not actually sure that he did say that
theres very little evidence to suggest it but what he did say is actually far nicer and again ive printed this im going to read it out
the first question which you will ask and which i must try to answer is this what is the use of climbing mt everest
and my answer must at once be it is no use
there is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever
oh we may learn a little about the behavior of the human body at high altitudes and possibly medical men may turn our observation to some account for the purposes of aviation but otherwise nothing will come of it
we shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver and not a gem nor any coal or iron
we shall not find a single foot of earth that can be planted with crops to raise food so it is no use
if you cannot understand that there is something in man which responds to the challenge of this mountain and goes out to meet it that the struggle is the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward then you wont see why we go
what we get from this adventure is just sheer joy and joy after all is the end of life
we dont live to eat and make money
we eat and make money to be able to enjoy life
that is what life means and that is what life is for
mallorys argument that leaving the house embarking on these grand adventures is joyful and fun however doesnt tally that neatly with my own experience
the furthest ive ever got away from my front door was in the spring of i still dont know exactly what came over me but my plan was to make a solo and unsupported crossing of the arctic ocean
i planned essentially to walk from the north coast of russia to the north pole and then to carry on to the north coast of canada
no one had ever done this i was at the time
a lot of experts were saying it was impossible and my mum certainly wasnt very keen on the idea
the journey from a small weather station on the north coast of siberia up to my final starting point the edge of the pack ice the coast of the arctic ocean took about five hours and if anyone watched fearless felix baumgartner going up rather than just coming down youll appreciate the sense of apprehension as i sat in a helicopter thundering north and the sense i think if anything of impending doom
i sat there wondering what on earth i had gotten myself into
there was a bit of fun a bit of joy
i was i remember sitting there looking down at my sledge i had my skis ready to go i had a satellite phone a pump action shotgun in case i was attacked by a polar bear
i remember looking out of the window and seeing the second helicopter
we were both thundering through this incredible siberian dawn and part of me felt a bit like a cross between jason bourne and wilfred thesiger part of me felt quite proud of myself but mostly i was just utterly terrified
and that journey lasted weeks days
i didnt see anyone else we took this photo next to the helicopter
beyond that i didnt see anyone for weeks
the north pole is slap bang in the middle of the sea so im traveling over the frozen surface of the arctic ocean
nasa described conditions that year as the worst since records began
i was dragging kilos of food and fuel and supplies about pounds the average temperature for the weeks was minus minus was the coldest
so again there wasnt an awful lot of joy or fun to be had
one of the magical things about this journey however is that because im walking over the sea over this floating drifting shifting crust of ice thats floating on top of the arctic ocean is its an environment thats in a constant state of flux
the ice is always moving breaking up drifting around refreezing so the scenery that i saw for nearly months was unique to me no one else will ever could ever possibly see the views the vistas that i saw for weeks
and that i guess is probably the finest argument for leaving the house
i can try to tell you what it was like but youll never know what it was like and the more i try to explain that i felt lonely i was the only human being in million square miles it was cold nearly minus with windchill on a bad day the more words fall short and im unable to do it justice
and it seems to me therefore that the doing you know to try to experience to engage to endeavor rather than to watch and to wonder thats where the real meat of life is to be found the juice that we can suck out of our hours and days
and i would add a cautionary note here however
in my experience there is something addictive about tasting life at the very edge of whats humanly possible
now i dont just mean in the field of daft macho edwardian style derring do but also in the fields of pancreatic cancer there is something addictive about this and in my case i think polar expeditions are perhaps not that far removed from having a crack habit
i cant explain quite how good it is until youve tried it but it has the capacity to burn up all the money i can get my hands on to ruin every relationship ive ever had so be careful what you wish for
mallory postulated that there is something in man that responds to the challenge of the mountain and i wonder if thats the case whether theres something in the challenge itself in the endeavor and particularly in the big unfinished chunky challenges that face humanity that call out to us and in my experience thats certainly the case
there is one unfinished challenge thats been calling out to me for most of my adult life
many of you will know the story
this is a photo of captain scott and his team
scott set out just over a hundred years ago to try to become the first person to reach the south pole
no one knew what was there it was utterly unmapped at the time we knew more about the surface of the moon than we did about the heart of antarctica
scott as many of you will know was beaten to it by roald amundsen and his norwegian team who used dogs and dogsleds scotts team were on foot all five of them wearing harnesses and dragging around sledges and they arrived at the pole to find the norwegian flag already there id imagine pretty bitter and demoralized
all five of them turned and started walking back to the coast and all five died on that return journey
there is a sort of misconception nowadays that its all been done in the fields of exploration and adventure
when i talk about antarctica people often say hasnt you know thats interesting hasnt that blue peter presenter just done it on a bike
or thats nice you know my grandmothers going on a cruise to antarctica next year you know
is there a chance youll see her there
but scotts journey remains unfinished
no one has ever walked from the very coast of antarctica to the south pole and back again
it is arguably the most audacious endeavor of that edwardian golden age of exploration and it seemed to me high time given everything we have figured out in the century since from scurvy to solar panels that it was high time someone had a go at finishing the job
so thats precisely what im setting out to do
this time next year in october im leading a team of three
it will take us about four months to make this return journey
thats the scale the red line is obviously halfway to the pole
we have to turn around and come back again
im well aware of the irony of telling you that we will be blogging and tweeting youll be able to live vicariously and virtually through this journey in a way that no one has ever before
and itll also be a four month chance for me to finally come up with a pithy answer to the question why
and our lives today are safer and more comfortable than they have ever been there certainly isnt much call for explorers nowadays my career advisor at school never mentioned it as an option
if i wanted to know for example how many stars were in the milky way how old those giant heads on easter island were most of you could find that out right now without even standing up
and yet if ive learned anything in nearly years now of dragging heavy things around cold places it is that true real inspiration and growth only comes from adversity and from challenge from stepping away from whats comfortable and familiar and stepping out into the unknown
in life we all have tempests to ride and poles to walk to and i think metaphorically speaking at least we could all benefit from getting outside the house a little more often if only we could summon up the courage
i certainly would implore you to open the door just a little bit and take a look at whats outside
thank you very much

title adam savage my obsession with objects and the stories they tell title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript adam savage talks about his fascination with the dodo bird and how it led him on a strange and surprising double quest its an entertaining adventure through the mind of a creative obsessive description
about four years ago the new yorker published an article about a cache of dodo bones that was found in a pit on the island of mauritius
now the island of mauritius is a small island off the east coast of madagascar in the indian ocean and it is the place where the dodo bird was discovered and extinguished all within about years
everyone was very excited about this archaeological find because it meant that they might finally be able to assemble a single dodo skeleton
see while museums all over the world have dodo skeletons in their collection nobody not even the actual natural history museum on the island of mauritius has a skeleton thats made from the bones of a single dodo
well this isnt exactly true
the fact is is that the british museum had a complete specimen of a dodo in their collection up until the century it was actually mummified skin and all but in a fit of space saving zeal they actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet and they burned the rest in a bonfire
if you go look at their website today theyll actually list these specimens saying the rest was lost in a fire
not quite the whole truth anyway
the frontispiece of this article was this photo and im one of the people that thinks that tina brown was great for bringing photos to the new yorker because this photo completely rocked my world
i became obsessed with the object not just the beautiful photograph itself the wire you can see on the beak there that the conservator used to put this skeleton together theres an entire story here
and i thought to myself wouldnt it be great if i had my own dodo skeleton
i want to point out here at this point that ive spent my life obsessed by objects and the stories that they tell and this was the very latest one
so i began looking around for to see if anyone sold a kit some kind of model that i could get and i found lots of reference material lots of lovely pictures
no dice no dodo skeleton for me but the damage had been done
i had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons into my creative projects folder its a repository for my brain everything that i could possibly be interested in
any time i have an internet connection theres a sluice of stuff moving into there everything from beautiful rings to cockpit photos
the key that the marquis du lafayette sent to george washington to celebrate the storming of the bastille
russian nuclear launch key the one on the top is the picture of the one i found on ebay the one on the bottom is the one i made for myself because i couldnt afford the one on ebay
storm trooper costumes maps of middle earth thats one i hand drew myself theres the dodo skeleton folder
this folder has photos over gigabytes of information and its growing constantly
and one day a couple of weeks later it might have been maybe a year later i was in the art store with my kids and i was buying some clay tools we were going to have a craft day
i bought some super sculpeys some armature wire some various materials
and i looked down at this sculpey and i thought maybe yeah maybe i could make my own dodo skull
i should point out at this time im not a sculptor im a hard edged model maker
you give me a drawing you give me a prop to replicate you give me a crane scaffolding parts from star wars especially parts from star wars i can do this stuff all day long
its exactly how i made my living for years
but you give me something like this my friend mike murnane sculpted this its a maquette for star wars episode two this is not my thing this is something other people do dragons soft things
however i felt like i had looked at enough photos of dodo skulls to actually be able to understand the topology and perhaps replicate it i mean it couldnt be that difficult
so i started looking at the best photos i could find
i grabbed all the reference and i found this lovely piece of reference
this is someone selling this on ebay it was clearly a woman s hand hopefully a womans hand
assuming it was roughly the size of my wifes hand i made some measurements of her thumb and i scaled them out to the size of the skull
i blew it up to the actual size and i began using that along with all the other reference that i had comparing it to it as size reference for figuring out exactly how big the beak should be exactly how long etc
and over a few hours i eventually achieved what was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull and i didnt mean to continue i its kind of like you know you can only clean a super messy room by picking up one thing at a time you cant think about the totality
i wasnt thinking about a dodo skeleton i just noticed that as i finished this skull the armature wire that i had been used to holding it up was sticking out of the back just where a spine would be
and one of the other things id been interested in and obsessed with over the years is spines and skeletons having collected a couple of hundred
i actually understood the mechanics of vertebrae enough to kind of start to imitate them
and so button by button vertebrae by vertebrae i built my way down
and actually by the end of the day i had a reasonable skull a moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis
and again i kept on going looking for more reference every bit of reference i could find drawings beautiful photos
this guy i love this guy he put a dodo leg bones on a scanner with a ruler
this is the kind of accuracy that i wanted and i replicated every last bone and put it in
and after about six weeks i finished painted mounted my own dodo skeleton
you can see that i even made a museum label for it that includes a brief history of the dodo
and tap plastics made me although i didnt photograph it a museum vitrine
i dont have the room for this in my house but i had to finish what i had started
and this actually represented kind of a sea change to me
again like i said my life has been about being fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell and also making them for myself obtaining them appreciating them and diving into them
and in this folder creative projects there are tons of projects that im currently working on projects that ive already worked on things that i might want to work on some day and things that i may just want to find and buy and have and look at and touch
but now there was potentially this new category of things that i could sculpt that was different that i you know i have my own but thats honestly relative to sculpting to me thats easy
and so i went back and looked through my creative projects folder and i happened across the maltese falcon
now this is funny for me to fall in love with an object from a hammett novel because if its true that the world is divided into two types of people chandler people and hammett people i am absolutely a chandler person
but in this case its not about the author its not about the book or the movie or the story its about the object in and of itself
and in this case this object is plays on a host of levels
first of all theres the object in the world
this is the kniphausen hawk
it is a ceremonial pouring vessel made around for a swedish count and it is very likely the object from which hammett drew his inspiration for the maltese falcon
then there is the fictional bird the one that hammett created for the book
built out of words it is the engine that drives the plot of his book and also the movie in which another object is created a prop that has to represent the thing that hammett created out of words inspired by the kniphausen hawk and this represents the falcon in the movie
and then there is this fourth level which is a whole new object in the world the prop made for the movie the representative of the thing becomes in its own right a whole other thing a whole new object of desire
and so now it was time to do some research
i actually had done some research a few years before its why the folder was there
id bought a replica a really crappy replica of the maltese falcon on ebay and had downloaded enough pictures to actually have some reasonable reference
but i discovered in researching further really wanting precise reference that one of the original lead birds had been sold at christies in and so i contacted an antiquarian bookseller who had the original christies catalogue and in it i found this magnificent picture which included a size reference
i was able to scan the picture blow it up to exactly full size
i found other reference avi chekmayan a new jersey editor actually found this resin maltese falcon at a flea market in although it took him five years to authenticate this bird to the auctioneers specifications because there was a lot of controversy about it
it was made out of resin which wasnt a common material for movie props about the time the movie was made
its funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it because i can see it compared to this thing and i can tell you its real its the real thing its made from the exact same mold that this one is
in this one because the auction was actually so controversial profiles in history the auction house that sold this i think in for about dollars they actually included you can see here on the bottom not just a front elevation but also a side rear and other side elevation
so now i had all the topology i needed to replicate the maltese falcon
what do they do how do you start something like that i really dont know
so what i did was again like i did with the dodo skull i blew all my reference up to full size and then i began cutting out the negatives and using those templates as shape references
so i took sculpey and i built a big block of it and i passed it through until you know i got the right profiles
and then slowly feather by feather detail by detail i worked out and achieved working in front of the television and super sculpey heres me sitting next to my wife its the only picture i took of the entire process
as i moved through i achieved a very reasonable facsimile of the maltese falcon
but again i am not a sculptor and so i dont know a lot of the tricks like i dont know how my friend mike gets beautiful shiny surfaces with his sculpey i certainly wasnt able to get it
so i went down to my shop and i molded it and i cast it in resin because in the resin then i could absolutely get the glass smooth finished
now theres a lot of ways to fill and get yourself a nice smooth finish
my preference is about coats of this matte black auto primer
i spray it on for about three or four days it drips to hell but it allows me a really really nice gentle sanding surface and i can get it glass smooth
oh finishing up with triple zero steel wool
now the great thing about getting it to this point was that because in the movie when they finally bring out the bird at the end and they place it on the table they actually spin it
so i was able to actually screen shot and freeze frame to make sure
and im following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as im holding the light in the same position im getting the same type of reflection on it thats the level of detail im going into this thing
i ended up with this my maltese falcon
and its beautiful and i can state with authority at this point in time when id finished it of all of the replicas out there and there is a few this is by far the most accurate representation of the original maltese falcon than anyone has sculpted now the original one i should tell you is sculpted by a guy named fred sexton
this is where it gets weird
fred sexton was a friend of this guy george hodel
terrifying guy agreed by many to be the killer of the black dahlia
now james ellroy believes that fred sexton the sculptor of the maltese falcon killed james elroys mother
ill go you one stranger than that in during the production of a weird comedy sequel to the maltese falcon called the black bird starring george segal the los angeles county museum of art had a plaster original of the maltese falcon one of the original six plasters i think made for the movie stolen out of the museum a lot of people thought it was a publicity stunt for the movie
johns grill which actually is seen briefly in the maltese falcon is still a viable san francisco eatery counted amongst its regular customers elisha cook who played wilmer cook in the movie and he gave them one of his original plasters of the maltese falcon
and they had it in their cabinet for about years until it got stolen in january of
it would seem that the object of desire only comes into its own by disappearing repeatedly
so here i had this falcon and it was lovely it looked really great the light worked on it really well it was better than anything that i could achieve or obtain out in the world
but there was a problem and the problem was that i wanted the entirety of the object i wanted the weight behind the object
this thing was made of resin and it was too light
theres this group online that i frequent
its a group of prop crazies just like me called the replica props forum and its people who trade make and travel in information about movie props
and it turned out that one of the guys there a friend of mine that i never actually met but befriended through some prop deals was the manager of a local foundry
he took my master falcon pattern he actually did lost wax casting in bronze for me and this is the bronze i got back
and this is after some acid etching the one that i ended up with
and this thing its deeply deeply satisfying to me
here im going to put it out there later on tonight and i want you to pick it up and handle it
you want to know how obsessed i am this projects only for me and yet i went so far as to buy on ebay a chinese san francisco based newspaper in order so that the bird could properly be wrapped
like it is in the movie
yeah i know
there you can see its weighing in at and a half pounds
thats half the weight of my dog huxley
but theres a problem
now heres the most recent progression of falcons
on the far left is a piece of crap a replica i bought on ebay
theres my somewhat ruined sculpey falcon because i had to get it back out of the mold theres my first casting theres my master and theres my bronze
theres a thing that happens when you mold and cast things which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin you lose a little bit of volume you lose a little bit of size
and when i held my bronze one up against my sculpey one it was shorter by three quarters of an inch
yeah no really this was like aah why didnt i remember this
why didnt i start and make it bigger
so what do i do i figure i have two options
one i can fire a freaking laser at it which i have already done to do a scan theres a scan of this falcon
i had figured out the exact amount of shrinkage i achieved going from a wax master to a bronze master and blown this up big enough to make which i will polish then i will send to the mold maker and then i will have it done in bronze or there are several people who own originals and i have been attempting to contact them and reach them hoping that they will let me spend a few minutes in the presence of one of the real birds maybe to take a picture or even to pull out the hand held laser scanner that i happen to own that fits inside a cereal box and could maybe without even touching their bird i swear get a perfect scan and im even willing to sign pages saying that ill never let anyone else have it except for me in my office i promise
ill give them one if they want it
and then maybe then ill achieve the end of this exercise
but really if were all going to be honest with ourselves i have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise was never the point of the exercise to begin with was it
thank you

title jan chipchase the anthropology of mobile phones title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript nokia researcher jan chipchases investigation into the ways we interact with technology has led him from the villages of uganda to the insides of our pockets hes made some unexpected discoveries along the way description
i live and work from tokyo japan
and i specialize in human behavioral research and applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways and to design for that future
and you know to be honest ive been doing this for seven years and i havent got a clue what the future is going to be like
but ive got a pretty good idea how people will behave when they get there
this is my office its out there
its not in the lab and its increasingly in places like india china brazil africa
we live on a planet billion people
about three billion people by the end of this year will have cellular connectivity
and itll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that
and i mention this because if we want to design for that future we need to figure out what those people are about
and thats kind of where i see what my job is and what our teams job is
our research often starts with a very simple question
so ill give you an example what do you carry
if you think of everything in your life that you own when you walk out that door what do you consider to take with you
when youre looking around what do you consider
of that stuff what do you carry
and of that stuff what do you actually use
so this is interesting to us because the conscious and subconscious decision process implies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using has some kind of spiritual emotional or functional value
and to put it really bluntly you know people are willing to pay for stuff that has value right
so ive probably done about five years research looking at what people carry
i go in peoples bags i look in peoples pockets purses
i go in their homes and we do this worldwide and we follow them around town with video cameras
its kind of like stalking with permission
and we do all this and to go back to the original question what do people carry
and it turns out that people carry a lot of stuff
ok thats fair enough
but if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are across cultures and across gender and across contexts most people will say keys money and if they own one a mobile phone
and im not saying this is a good thing but this is a thing right
i mean i couldnt take your phones off you if i wanted to
youd probably kick me out or something
ok it might seem like an obvious thing for someone who works for a mobile phone company to ask
but really the question is why right
so why are these things so important in our lives
and it turns out from our research that it boils down to survival survival for us and survival for our loved ones
so keys provide an access to shelter and warmth transport as well in the u s increasingly
money is useful for buying food sustenance among all its other uses
and a mobile phone it turns out is a great recovery tool
if you prefer this kind of maslows hierarchy of needs those three objects are very good at supporting the lowest rungs in maslows hierarchy of needs
yes they do a whole bunch of other stuff but theyre very good at this
and in particular its the mobile phones ability to allow people to transcend space and time
and what i mean by that is you know you can transcend space by simply making a voice call right
and you can transcend time by sending a message at your convenience and someone else can pick it up at their convenience
and this is fairly universally appreciated it turns out which is why we have three billion plus people who have been connected
and they value that connectivity
but actually you can do this kind of stuff with pcs
and you can do them with phone kiosks
and the mobile phone in addition is both personal and so it also gives you a degree of privacy and its convenient
you dont need to ask permission from anyone you can just go ahead and do it right
however for these things to help us survive it depends on them being carried
but and its a pretty big but we forget
were human thats what we do its one of our features
i think quite a nice feature
so we forget but were also adaptable and we adapt to situations around us pretty well
and so we have these strategies to remember and one of them was mentioned yesterday
and its quite simply the point of reflection
and thats that moment when youre walking out of a space and you turn around and quite often you tap your pockets
even women who keep stuff in their bags tap their pockets
and you turn around and you look back into the space and some people talk aloud
and pretty much everyone does it at some point
ok the next thing is most of you if you have a stable home life and what i mean is that you dont travel all the time and always in hotels but most people have what we call a center of gravity
and a center of gravity is where you keep these objects
and these things dont stay in the center of gravity but over time they gravitate there
its where you expect to find stuff
and in fact when youre turning around and youre looking inside the house and youre looking for this stuff this is where you look first right
ok so when we did this research we found the absolutely percent guaranteed way to never forget anything ever ever again
and that is quite simply to have nothing to remember
ok now that sounds like something you get on a chinese fortune cookie right
but is in fact about the art of delegation
and from a design perspective its about understanding what you can delegate to technology and what you can delegate to other people
and it turns out delegation if you want it to be can be the solution for pretty much everything apart from things like bodily functions going to the toilet
you cant ask someone to do that on your behalf
and apart from things like entertainment you wouldnt pay for someone to go to the cinema for you and have fun on your behalf or at least not yet
maybe sometime in the future we will
so let me give you an example of delegation in practice right
so this is probably the thing im most passionate about is the research that weve been doing on illiteracy and how people who are illiterate communicate
so the u n estimated this is figures that there are almost million people who cant read and write worldwide
so weve been conducting a lot of research
and one of the things we were looking at is if you cant read and write if you want to communicate over distances you need to be able to identify the person that you want to communicate with
it could be a phone number it could be an e mail address it could be a postal address
simple question if you cant read and write how do you manage your contact information
and the fact is that millions of people do it
just from a design perspective we didnt really understand how they did it and so thats just one small example of the kind of research that we were doing
and it turns out that illiterate people are masters of delegation
so they delegate that part of the task process to other people the stuff that they cant do themselves
let me give you another example of delegation
this ones a little bit more sophisticated and this is from a study that we did in uganda about how people who are sharing devices use those devices
sente is a word in uganda that means money
it has a second meaning which is to send money as airtime ok
and it works like this
so lets say june youre in a village rural village
im in kampala and im the wage earner
im sending money back and it works like this
so in your village theres one person in the village with a phone and thats the phone kiosk operator
and its quite likely that theyd have a quite simple mobile phone as a phone kiosk
so what i do is i buy a prepaid card like this
and instead of using that money to top up my own phone i call up the local village operator
and i read out that number to them and they use it to top up their phone
so theyre topping up the value from kampala and its now being topped up in the village
you take a or percent commission and then you the kiosk operator takes or percent commission and passes the rest over to you in cash
ok theres two things i like about this
so the first is it turns anyone who has access to a mobile phone anyone who has a mobile phone essentially into an atm machine
it brings rudimentary banking services to places where theres no banking infrastructure
and even if they could have access to the banking infrastructure they wouldnt necessarily be considered viable customers because theyre not wealthy enough to have bank accounts
theres a second thing i like about this
and that is that despite all the resources at my disposal and despite all our kind of apparent sophistication i know i could never have designed something as elegant and as totally in tune with the local conditions as this ok
and yes there are things like grameen bank and micro lending
but the difference between this and that is theres no central authority trying to control this
this is just street up innovation
so it turns out the street is a never ending source of inspiration for us
and ok if you break one of these things here you return it to the carrier
theyll give you a new one
theyll probably give you three new ones right
i mean thats buy three get one free that kind of thing
if you go on the streets of india and china you see this kind of stuff
and this is where they take the stuff that breaks and they fix it and they put it back into circulation
this is from a workbench in jilin city in china and you can see people taking down a phone and putting it back together
they reverse engineer manuals
this is a kind of hackers manual and its written in chinese and english
they also write them in hindi
you can subscribe to these
there are training institutes where theyre churning out people for fixing these things as well
but what i like about this is it boils down to someone on the street with a small flat surface a screwdriver a toothbrush for cleaning the contact heads because they often get dust on the contact heads and knowledge
and its all about the social network of the knowledge floating around
and i like this because it challenges the way that we design stuff and build stuff and potentially distribute stuff
it challenges the norms
ok for me the street just raises so many different questions
like this is viagra that i bought from a backstreet sex shop in china
and china is a country where you get a lot of fakes
and i know what youre asking did i test it
im not going to answer that ok
but i look at something like this and i consider the implications of trust and confidence in the purchase process
and we look at this and we think well how does that apply for example for the design of the lessons from this apply to the design of online services future services in these markets
this is a pair of underpants from from tibet
and i look at something like this and honestly you know why would someone design underpants with a pocket right
and i look at something like this and it makes me question if we were to take all the functionality in things like this and redistribute them around the body in some kind of personal area network how would we prioritize where to put stuff
and yes this is quite trivial but actually the lessons from this can apply to that kind of personal area networks
and what you see here is a couple of phone numbers written above the shack in rural uganda
this doesnt have house numbers this has phone numbers
so what does it mean when peoples identity is mobile
when those extra three billion peoples identity is mobile it isnt fixed
your notion of identity is out of date already ok for those extra three billion people
this is how its shifting
and then i go to this picture here which is the one that i started with
and this is from delhi
its from a study we did into illiteracy and its a guy in a teashop
you can see the chai being poured in the background
and hes a you know incredibly poor teashop worker on the lowest rungs in the society
and he somehow has the appreciation of the values of livestrong
and its not necessarily the same values but some kind of values of livestrong to actually go out and purchase them and actually display them
for me this kind of personifies this connected world where everything is intertwined and the dots are its all about the dots joining together
ok the title of this presentation is connections and consequences and its really a kind of summary of five years of trying to figure out what its going to be like when everyone on the planet has the ability to transcend space and time in a personal and convenient manner right
when everyones connected
and there are four things
so the first thing is the immediacy of ideas the speed at which ideas go around
and i know ted is about big ideas but actually the benchmark for a big idea is changing
if you want a big idea you need to embrace everyone on the planet thats the first thing
the second thing is the immediacy of objects
and what i mean by that is as these become smaller as the functionality that you can access through this becomes greater things like banking identity these things quite simply move very quickly around the world
and so the speed of the adoption of things is just going to become that much more rapid in a way that we just totally cannot conceive when you get it to billion and the growth in the worlds population
the next thing is that however we design this stuff carefully design this stuff the street will take it and will figure out ways to innovate as long as it meets base needs the ability to transcend space and time for example
and it will innovate in ways that we cannot anticipate
in ways that despite our resources they can do it better than us
thats my feeling
and if were smart well look at this stuff thats going on and well figure out a way to enable it to inform and infuse both what we design and how we design
and the last thing is that actually the direction of the conversation
with another three billion people connected they want to be part of the conversation
and i think our relevance and teds relevance is really about embracing that and learning how to listen essentially
and we need to learn how to listen
so thank you very very much

title mark bittman whats wrong with what we eat title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript in this fiery and funny talk new york times food writer mark bittman weighs in on whats wrong with the way we eat now and why its putting the entire planet at risk description
i write about food i write about cooking
i take it quite seriously but im here to talk about something thats become very important to me in the last year or two
it is about food but its not about cooking per se
im going to start with this picture of a beautiful cow
im not a vegetarian this is the old nixon line right
but i still think that this may be this years version of this
now that is only a little bit hyperbolic
and why do i say it
because only once before has the fate of individual people and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwined
there was the bomb and theres now
and where we go from here is going to determine not only the quality and the length of our individual lives but whether if we could see the earth a century from now wed recognize it
its a holocaust of a different kind and hiding under our desks isnt going to help
start with the notion that global warming is not only real but dangerous
since every scientist in the world now believes this and even president bush has seen the light or pretends to we can take this is a given
then hear this please
after energy production livestock is the second highest contributor to atmosphere altering gases
nearly one fifth of all greenhouse gas is generated by livestock production more than transportation
now you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts but methane is times more poisonous than and its not just methane
livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation air and water pollution water shortages and loss of biodiversity
theres more
like half the antibiotics in this country are not administered to people but to animals
but lists like this become kind of numbing so let me just say this if youre a progressive if youre driving a prius or youre shopping green or youre looking for organic you should probably be a semi vegetarian
now im no more anti cattle than i am anti atom but its all in the way we use these things
theres another piece of the puzzle which ann cooper talked about beautifully yesterday and one you already know
theres no question none that so called lifestyle diseases diabetes heart disease stroke some cancers are diseases that are far more prevalent here than anywhere in the rest of the world
and thats the direct result of eating a western diet
our demand for meat dairy and refined carbohydrates the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of coke a day our demand for these things not our need our want drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us
and those calories are in foods that cause not prevent disease
now global warming was unforeseen
we didnt know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility
maybe a few lung diseases here and there but you know thats not such a big deal
the current health crisis however is a little more the work of the evil empire
we were told we were assured that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate the healthier wed be
no overconsumption of animals and of course junk food is the problem along with our paltry consumption of plants
now theres no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here but the evidence is that plants and i want to make this clear its not the ingredients in plants its the plants
its not the beta carotene its the carrot
the evidence is very clear that plants promote health
this evidence is overwhelming at this point
you eat more plants you eat less other stuff you live longer
not bad
but back to animals and junk food
what do they have in common
one we dont need either of them for health
we dont need animal products and we certainly dont need white bread or coke
two both have been marketed heavily creating unnatural demand
were not born craving whoppers or skittles
three their production has been supported by government agencies at the expense of a more health and earth friendly diet
now lets imagine a parallel
lets pretend that our government supported an oil based economy while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy knowing all the while that the result would be pollution war and rising costs
incredible isnt it
yet they do that
and they do this here its the same deal
the sad thing is when it comes to diet is that even when well intentioned feds try to do right by us they fail
either theyre outvoted by puppets of agribusiness or they are puppets of agribusiness
so when the usda finally acknowledged that it was plants rather than animals that made people healthy they encouraged us via their overly simplistic food pyramid to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day along with more carbs
what they didnt tell us is that some carbs are better than others and that plants and whole grains should be supplanting eating junk food
but industry lobbyists would never let that happen
and guess what
half the people who developed the food pyramid have ties to agribusiness
so instead of substituting plants for animals our swollen appetites simply became larger and the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged
so called low fat diets so called low carb diets these are not solutions
but with lots of intelligent people focusing on whether food is organic or local or whether were being nice to animals the most important issues just arent being addressed
now dont get me wrong
i like animals and i dont think its just fine to industrialize their production and to churn them out like they were wrenches
but theres no way to treat animals well when youre killing billion of them a year
thats our number billion
if you strung all of them chickens cows pigs and lambs to the moon theyd go there and back five times there and back
now my maths a little shaky but this is pretty good and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long but you get the idea
thats just the united states
and with our hyper consumption of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease kindness might just be a bit of a red herring
lets get the numbers of the animals were killing for eating down and then well worry about being nice to the ones that are left
another red herring might be exemplified by the word locavore which was just named word of the year by the new oxford american dictionary
seriously
and locavore for those of you who dont know is someone who eats only locally grown food which is fine if you live in california but for the rest of us its a bit of a sad joke
between the official story the food pyramid and the hip locavore vision you have two versions of how to improve our eating
they both get it wrong though
the first at least is populist and the second is elitist
how we got to this place is the history of food in the united states
and im going to go through that at least the last hundred years or so very quickly right now
a hundred years ago guess what
everyone was a locavore even new york had pig farms nearby and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion
every family had a cook usually a mom
and those moms bought and prepared food
it was like your romantic vision of europe
margarine didnt exist
in fact when margarine was invented several states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink so wed all know that it was a fake
there was no snack food and until the until clarence birdseye came along there was no frozen food
there were no restaurant chains
there were neighborhood restaurants run by local people but none of them would think to open another one
eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic
and fancy food was entirely french
as an aside those of you who remember dan aykroyd in the doing julia child imitations can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide
back in those days before even julia back in those days there was no philosophy of food
you just ate
you didnt claim to be anything
there was no marketing there were no national brands
vitamins had not been invented
there were no health claims at least not federally sanctioned ones
fats carbs proteins they werent bad or good they were food
you ate food
hardly anything contained more than one ingredient because it was an ingredient
the cornflake hadnt been invented
the pop tart the pringle cheez whiz none of that stuff
goldfish swam
its hard to imagine people grew food and they ate food
and again everyone ate local
in new york an orange was a common christmas present because it came all the way from florida
from the on road systems expanded trucks took the place of railroads fresh food began to travel more
oranges became common in new york
the south and west became agricultural hubs and in other parts of the country suburbs took over farmland
the effects of this are well known they are everywhere
and the death of family farms is part of this puzzle as is almost everything from the demise of the real community to the challenge of finding a good tomato even in summer
eventually california produced too much food to ship fresh so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods
thus arrived convenience
it was sold to proto feminist housewives as a way to cut down on housework
now i know everybody over the age of like their mouths are watering at this point
if we had a slide of salisbury steak even more so right
but this may have cut down on housework but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well
many of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad
i for one and im not kidding didnt eat real spinach or broccoli till i was
who needed it though meat was everywhere
what could be easier more filling or healthier for your family than broiling a steak
but by then cattle were already raised unnaturally
rather than spending their lives eating grass for which their stomachs were designed they were forced to eat soy and corn
they have trouble digesting those grains of course but that wasnt a problem for producers
new drugs kept them healthy
well they kept them alive
healthy was another story
thanks to farm subsidies the fine collaboration between agribusiness and congress soy corn and cattle became king
and chicken soon joined them on the throne
it was during this period that the cycle of dietary and planetary destruction began the thing were only realizing just now
listen to this between and the worlds population doubled
meat consumption increased five fold
now someone had to eat all that stuff so we got fast food
and this took care of the situation resoundingly
home cooking remained the norm but its quality was down the tubes
there were fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts and soups because all of them could be bought at any store
not that they were any good but they were there
most moms cooked like mine a piece of broiled meat a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup canned fruit salad
maybe baked or mashed potatoes or perhaps the stupidest food ever minute rice
for dessert store bought ice cream or cookies
my mom is not here so i can say this now
this kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself
it wasnt all bad
by the forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients
we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians
we werent all hippies either
some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well
meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial
perhaps because it was being produced rationally as if it were plastic food gained magical or poisonous powers or both
many people became fat phobic
others worshiped broccoli as if it were god like
but mostly they didnt eat broccoli
instead they were sold on yogurt yogurt being almost as good as broccoli
except in reality the way the industry sold yogurt was to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream
similarly lets look at a granola bar
you think that that might be healthy food but in fact if you look at the ingredient list its closer in form to a snickers than it is to oatmeal
sadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma if not actually killed the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contained as many soy and corn products as could be crammed into it
think of the frozen chicken nugget
the chicken is fed corn and then its meat is ground up and mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder and then its fried in corn oil
all you do is nuke it what could be better
and zapped horribly pathetically
by the home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home
at the same time masses of women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasnt important enough for men to share the burden
so now youve got your pizza nights youve got your microwave nights youve got your grazing nights youve got your fend for yourself nights and so on
leading the way whats leading the way
meat junk food cheese the very stuff that will kill you
so now we clamor for organic food
thats good
and as evidence that things can actually change you can now find organic food in supermarkets and even in fast food outlets
but organic food isnt the answer either at least not the way its currently defined
let me pose you a question
can farm raised salmon be organic when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet even if the feed itself is supposedly organic and the fish themselves are packed tightly in pens swimming in their own filth
and if that salmons from chile and its killed down there and then flown miles whatever dumping how much carbon into the atmosphere
i dont know
packed in styrofoam of course before landing somewhere in the united states and then being trucked a few hundred more miles
this may be organic in letter but its surely not organic in spirit
now here is where we all meet
the locavores the organivores the vegetarians the vegans the gourmets and those of us who are just plain interested in good food
even though weve come to this from different points we all have to act on our knowledge to change the way that everyone thinks about food
we need to start acting
and this is not only an issue of social justice as ann cooper said and of course shes completely right but its also one of global survival
which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food
as i said percent of greenhouse gases are attributed to livestock production
how much livestock do you need to produce this
percent of the agricultural land on earth percent of the earths land surface is directly or indirectly devoted to raising the animals well eat
and this amount is predicted to double in the next years or so
and if the numbers coming in from china are anything like what they look like now its not going to be years
there is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do
and i say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life
the most common argument is that we need nutrients even though we eat on average twice as much protein as even the industry obsessed usda recommends
but listen experts who are serious about disease reduction recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week
what do you think we eat per day half a pound
but dont we need meat to be big and strong
isnt meat eating essential to health
wont a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables turn us into godless sissy liberals
some of us might think that would be a good thing
but no even if we were all steroid filled football players the answer is no
in fact theres no diet on earth that meets basic nutritional needs that wont promote growth and many will make you much healthier than ours does
we dont eat animal products for sufficient nutrition we eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition and its killing us
to suggest that in the interests of personal and human health americans eat percent less meat its not enough of a cut but its a start
it would seem absurd but thats exactly what should happen and what progressive people forward thinking people should be doing and advocating along with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants
ive been writing about food more or less omnivorously one might say indiscriminately for about years
during that time ive eaten and recommended eating just about everything
ill never stop eating animals im sure but i do think that for the benefit of everyone the time has come to stop raising them industrially and stop eating them thoughtlessly
ann coopers right
the usda is not our ally here
we have to take matters into our own hands not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone and thats the hard part but by improving our own
and that happens to be quite easy
less meat less junk more plants
its a simple formula eat food
eat real food
we can continue to enjoy our food and we continue to eat well and we can eat even better
we can continue the search for the ingredients we love and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals
well reduce not only calories but our carbon footprint
we can make food more important not less and save ourselves by doing so
we have to choose that path
thank you

title david hanson robots that show emotion title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript david hansons robot faces look and act like yours they recognize and respond to emotion and make expressions of their own here an emotional live demo of the einstein robot offers a peek at a future where robots truly mimic humans description
im dr david hanson and i build robots with character
and by that i mean that i develop robots that are characters but also robots that will eventually come to empathize with you
so were starting with a variety of technologies that have converged into these conversational character robots that can see faces make eye contact with you make a full range of facial expressions understand speech and begin to model how youre feeling and who you are and build a relationship with you
i developed a series of technologies that allowed the robots to make more realistic facial expressions than previously achieved on lower power which enabled the walking biped robots the first androids
so its a full range of facial expressions simulating all the major muscles in the human face running on very small batteries extremely lightweight
the materials that allowed the battery operated facial expressions is a material that we call frubber and it actually has three major innovations in the material that allow this to happen
one is hierarchical pores and the other is a macro molecular nanoscale porosity in the material
there hes starting to walk
this is at the korean advanced institute of science and technology
i built the head they built the body
so the goal here is to achieve sentience in machines and not just sentience but empathy
were working with the machine perception laboratory at the u c san diego
they have this really remarkable facial expression technology that recognizes facial expressions what facial expressions youre making
it also recognizes where youre looking your head orientation
were emulating all the major facial expressions and then controlling it with the software that we call the character engine
and here is a little bit of the technology thats involved in that
in fact right now plug it from here and then plug it in here and now lets see if it gets my facial expressions
okay so im smiling
now im frowning
and this is really heavily backlit
okay here we go
oh its so sad
okay so you smile frowning
so his perception of your emotional states is very important for machines to effectively become empathetic
machines are becoming devastatingly capable of things like killing right
those machines have no place for empathy
and there is billions of dollars being spent on that
character robotics could plant the seed for robots that actually have empathy
so if they achieve human level intelligence or quite possibly greater than human levels of intelligence this could be the seeds of hope for our future
so weve made robots in the last eight years during the course of getting my ph d
and then i started hanson robotics which has been developing these things for mass manufacturing
this is one of our robots that we showed at wired nextfest a couple of years ago
and it sees multiple people in a scene remembers where individual people are and looks from person to person remembering people
so were involving two things
one the perception of people and two the natural interface the natural form of the interface so that its more intuitive for you to interact with the robot
you start to believe that its alive and aware
so one of my favorite projects was bringing all this stuff together in an artistic display of an android portrait of science fiction writer philip k dick who wrote great works like do androids dream of electric sheep
which was the basis of the movie bladerunner
in these stories robots often think that theyre human and they sort of come to life
so we put his writings letters his interviews correspondences into a huge database of thousands of pages and then used some natural language processing to allow you to actually have a conversation with him
and it was kind of spooky because he would say these things that just sounded like they really understood you
and this is one of the most exciting projects that were developing which is a little character thats a spokesbot for friendly artificial intelligence friendly machine intelligence
and were getting this mass manufactured
we specked it out to actually be doable with a very very low cost bill of materials so that it can become a childhood companion for kids
interfacing with the internet it gets smarter over the years
as artificial intelligence evolves so does his intelligence
chris anderson thank you so much thats incredible

title scott kim the art of puzzles title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript at the eg conference famed puzzle designer scott kim takes us inside the puzzle makers frame of mind sampling his careers work he introduces a few of the most popular types and shares the fascinations that inspired some of his best description
for the last years ive been designing puzzles
and im here today to give you a little tour starting from the very first puzzle i designed through what im doing now
ive designed puzzles for books printed things
im the puzzle columnist for discover magazine
ive been doing that for about years
i have a monthly puzzle calendar
i do toys the bulk of my work is in computer games
i did puzzles for bejeweled
i didnt invent bejeweled i cant take credit for that
so very first puzzle sixth grade my teacher said oh lets see that guy he likes to make stuff
ill have him cut out letters out of construction paper for the board
i thought this was a great assignment
and so here is what i came up with i start fiddling with it
i came up with this letter this is a letter of the alphabet thats been folded just once
the question is which letter is it if i unfold it
one hint its not l
it could be an l of course
so what else could it be
yeah a lot of you got it
oh yeah so clever thing
now that was my first puzzle i got hooked
i created something new i was very excited because you know id made crossword puzzles but thats sort of like filling in somebody elses matrix
this was something really original i got hooked
i read martin gardners columns in scientific american
went on and eventually decided to devote myself full time to that
now i should pause and say what do i mean by puzzle
a puzzle is a problem that is fun to solve and has a right answer
fun to solve as opposed to everyday problems which frankly are not very well designed puzzles
you know they might have a solution
it might take a long time nobody wrote down the rules clearly
who designed this
its like you know life is not a very well written story so we have to hire writers to make movies
well i take everyday problems and i make puzzles out of them
and right answer of course there might be more than one right answer many puzzles have more than one
but as opposed to a couple other forms of play toys and games by toy i mean something you play with that doesnt have a particular goal
you can create one out of legos
you know you can do anything you want
or competitive games like chess where well youre not trying to solve you can make a chess puzzle but the goal really is to beat another player
i consider that puzzles are an art form
theyre very ancient it goes back as long as there is written history
its a very small form like a joke a poem a magic trick or a song very compact form
at worst theyre throwaways theyre for amusement
but at best they can reach for something more and create a memorable impression
the progression of my career that youll see is looking for creating puzzles that have a memorable impact
so one thing i found early on when i started doing computer games is that i could create puzzles that will alter your perception
ill show you how here is a famous one
so its two profiles in black or a white vase in the middle
this is called a figure ground illusion
the artist m c escher exploited that in some of his wonderful prints
here we have day and night
here is what i did with figure and ground
so here we have figure in black
here we have figure in white
and its all part of the same design
the background to one is the other
originally i tried to do the words figure and ground
but i couldnt do that i realized i changed the problem
its all figure
a few other things here is my name
and that turns into the title of my first book inversions
these sorts of designs now go by the word ambigram
ill show you just a couple others here we have the numbers one through the digits zero through nine actually
each letter here is one of these digits
not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense
i like pushing on what an ambigram can mean
heres the word mirror no its not the same upside down
its the same this way
and a marvelous fellow from the media lab who just got appointed head of risd is john maeda
and so i did this for him its sort of a visual canon
and recently in magic magazine ive done a number of ambigrams on magicians names
so here we have penn and teller same upside down
this appears in my puzzle calendar
okay lets go back to the slides
thank you very much
now those are fun to look at
now how would you do it interactively
for a while i was an interface designer
and so i think a lot about interaction
well lets first of all simplify the vases illusion make the thing on the right
now if you could pick up the black vase it would look like the figure on top
if you could pick up the white area it would look like the figure on the bottom
well you cant do that physically but on a computer you can do it lets switch over to the p c
and here it is figure ground
the goal here is to take the pieces on the left and make them so they look like the shape on the right
and this follows the rules i just said any black area that is surrounded by white can be picked up
but that is also true of any white area
so here we got the white area in the middle and you can pick it up
ill just go one step further
so here is here is a couple pieces move them together and now this is an active piece
you can really get inside somebodys perception and have them experience something
its like the old maxim of you can tell somebody something and show them but if they do it they really learn it
here is another thing you can do
there is a game called rush hour
this is one of the true masterpieces in puzzle design besides rubiks cube
so here we have a crowded parking lot with cars all over the place
the goal is to get the red car out its a sliding block puzzle
its made by the company think fun
its done very well i love this puzzle
well lets play one here so here is a very simple puzzle
well thats too simple lets add another piece
okay so how would you solve this one
well move the blue one out of the way
here lets make it a little harder still pretty easy
now well make it harder a little harder
now this one is a little bit trickier
you know what do you do here
the first move is going to be what
youre going to move the blue one up in order to get the lavender one to the right
and you can make puzzles like this one that arent solvable at all
those four are locked in a pinwheel you cant get them apart
i wanted to make a sequel
i didnt come up with the original idea but this is another way i work as an inventor is to create a sequel
i came up with this this is railroad rush hour
its the same basic game except i introduced a new piece a square piece that can move both horizontally and vertically
in the other game the cars can only move forward and back
created a whole bunch of levels for it
now im making it available to schools
and it includes exercises that show you not just how to solve these puzzles but how to extract the principles that will let you solve mathematical puzzles or problems in science other areas
so im really interested in you learning how to make your own puzzles as well as just me creating them
garry trudeau calls himself an investigative cartoonist
you know he does a lot of research before he writes a cartoon
in discover magazine im an investigative puzzle maker
i got interested in gene sequencing
and i said well how on earth can you come up with a sequence of the base pairs in dna
cut up the dna you sequence individual pieces and then you look for overlaps and you basically match them at the edges and i said this is kind of like a jigsaw puzzle except the pieces overlap
so here is what i created for discover magazine
and it has to be solvable in a magazine
you know you cant cut out the pieces and move them around
so here is the nine pieces and youre supposed to put them into this grid
and you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge
there is only one solution its not that hard
but it takes some persistence
and when youre done it makes this design which if you squint is the word helix
so thats the form of the puzzle coming out of the content rather than the other way around
here is a couple more here is a physics based puzzle
which way will these fall
one of these weighs pounds pounds and pounds
and depending on which one weighs which amount theyll fall different directions
and here is a puzzle based on color mixing
i separated this image into cyan magenta yellow black the basic printing colors and then mixed up the separations and you get these peculiar pictures
which separations were mixed up to make those pictures
gets you thinking about color
finally what im doing now so shufflebrain com website you can go visit i joined up with my wife amy jo kim
she could easily be up here giving a talk about her work
so were making smart games for social media
ill explain what that means were looking at three trends
this is whats going on in the games industry right now
first of all you know for a long time computer games meant things like doom where youre going around shooting things very violent games very fast aimed at teenage boys right thats who plays computer games
well guess what thats changing
bejeweled is a big hit it was the game that really broke open whats called casual games
and the main players are over and are female
then recently rock band has been a big hit
and its a game you play with other people
its very physical it looks nothing like a traditional game
this is whats becoming the dominant form of electronic gaming
now within that there is some interesting things happening
there is also a trend towards games that are good for you
why well we aging boomers baby boomers were eating our healthy food were exercising what about our minds
oh no our parents are getting alzheimers we better do something
turns out doing crossword puzzles can stave off some of the effects of alzheimers
so we got games like brain age coming out for the nintendo ds huge hit
a lot of people do sudoku in fact some doctors prescribe it
and then there is social media and whats happening on the internet
everybody now considers themselves a creator and not just a viewer
and what does this add up to
here is what we see coming
its games that fit into a healthy lifestyle
theyre part of your life theyre not necessarily a separate thing
and they are both something that is good for you and theyre fun
im a puzzle guy my wife is an expert in social media
and we decided to combine our skills
our first game is called photo grab the game takes about a minute and seconds
this is your first time playing my game okay
lets see how well we can do there are three images
and we have seconds each
where is that
ill play as fast as i can
but if you can see it shout out the answer
you get more down okay yeah where is that
oh yeah there okay j o and i guess thats that part we got the bow that bow helps
thats his hair you get a lot of figure ground problems
yeah that one is easy okay so ahhh okay on to the next one
okay so thats the lens
anybody
looks like a black shape so where is that
thats the corner of the whole thing
yeah ive played this image before but even when i make up my own puzzles and you can put your own images in here
and we have people all over the world doing that now
there we are visit shufflebrain com if you want to try it yourself thank you

title gever tulley life lessons through tinkering title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript gever tulley uses engaging photos and footage to demonstrate the valuable lessons kids learn at his tinkering school when given tools materials and guidance these young imaginations run wild and creative problem solving takes over to build unique boats bridges and even a roller coaster description
this is the exact moment that i started creating something called tinkering school
tinkering school is a place where kids can pick up sticks and hammers and other dangerous objects and be trusted
trusted not to hurt themselves and trusted not to hurt others
tinkering school doesnt follow a set curriculum and there are no tests
were not trying to teach anybody any specific thing
when the kids arrive theyre confronted with lots of stuff wood and nails and rope and wheels and lots of tools real tools
its a six day immersive experience for the kids
and within that context we can offer the kids time something that seems in short supply in their over scheduled lives
our goal is to ensure that they leave with a better sense of how to make things than when they arrived and the deep internal realization that you can figure things out by fooling around
nothing ever turns out as planned ever
and the kids soon learn that all projects go awry and become at ease with the idea that every step in a project is a step closer to sweet success or gleeful calamity
we start from doodles and sketches
and sometimes we make real plans
and sometimes we just start building
building is at the heart of the experience hands on deeply immersed and fully committed to the problem at hand
robin and i acting as collaborators keep the landscape of the projects tilted towards completion
success is in the doing and failures are celebrated and analyzed
problems become puzzles and obstacles disappear
when faced with particularly difficult setbacks or complexities a really interesting behavior emerges decoration
decoration of the unfinished project is a kind of conceptual incubation
from these interludes come deep insights and amazing new approaches to solving the problems that had them frustrated just moments before
all materials are available for use
even those mundane hateful plastic grocery bags can become a bridge stronger than anyone imagined
and the things that they build amaze even themselves

title bruce mccall what is retro futurism title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript bruce mccall paints a retro future that never happened full of flying cars polo playing tanks and the rms tyrannic the biggest thing in all the world at serious play he narrates a brisk and funny slideshow of his faux nostalgic art description
i dont know what the hell im doing here
i was born in a scots presbyterian ghetto in canada and dropped out of high school i dont own a cell phone and i paint on paper using gouache which hasnt changed in years
but about three years ago i had an art show in new york and i titled it serious nonsense
so i think im actually the first one here i lead
i called it serious nonsense because on the serious side i use a technique of painstaking realism of editorial illustration from when i was a kid i copied it and i never unlearned it its the only style i know and its very kind of staid and formal
and meanwhile i use nonsense as you can see
this is a scottish castle where people are playing golf indoors and the trick was to bang the golf ball off of suits of armor which you cant see there
this was one of a series called zany afternoons which became a book
this is a home built rocket propelled car thats a henry j im a bug for authenticity in a quiet neighborhood in toledo
this is my submission for the l a museum of film
you can probably tell frank gehry and i come from the same town
my work is so personal and so strange that i have to invent my own lexicon for it
and i work a lot in what i call retrofuturism which is looking back to see how yesterday viewed tomorrow
and theyre always wrong always hilariously optimistically wrong
and the peak time for that was the because the depression was so dismal that anything to get away from the present into the future
and technology was going to carry us along
this is popular workbench popular science magazines in those days i had a huge collection of them from the all they are is just poor people being asked to make sunglasses out of wire coat hangers and everything improvised and dreaming about these wonderful giant radio robots playing ice hockey at miles an hour its all going to happen its all going to be wonderful
automotive retrofuturism is one of my specialties
i was both an automobile illustrator and an advertising automobile copywriter so i have a lot of revenge to take on the subject
detroit has always been halfway into the future the advertising half
this is the bulgemobile so new they make tomorrow look like yesterday
this is a chain gang of guys admiring the car
thats from a whole catalog its pages or so ran back in the days of the lampoon where i cut my teeth
techno archaeology is digging back and finding past miracles that never happened for good reason usually
the zeppelin this was from a brochure about the zeppelin based obviously on the hindenburg
but the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man
and it carried people at the speed of a buick at an altitude you could hear dogs bark and it cost twice as much as a first class cabin on the normandie to fly it
so the hindenburg wasnt you know it was inevitable it was going to go
this is auto gyro jousting in malibu in the
the auto gyro couldnt wait for the invention of the helicopter but it should have it wasnt a big success
its the only spanish innovation technologically of the century by the way
you needed to know that
the flying car which never got off the ground it was a post war dream
my old man used to tell me we were going to get a flying car
this is pitched into the future from looking at the day all american families have them
theres moscow shirley hope they speak esperanto
faux nostalgia which im sort of not say famous for but i work an awful lot in it
its the achingly sentimental yearning for times that never happened
somebody once said that nostalgia is the one utterly most useless human emotion so i think that s a case for serious play
this is emblematic of it this is wing dining recalling those balmy summer days somewhere over france in the dining on the wing of a plane you cant see it very well here but thats hemingway reading some pages from his new novel to fitzgerald and ford madox ford until the slipstream blows him away
this is tank polo in the south hamptons
the brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody i do a lot of that
and authenticity is a major part of my serious nonsense
i think it adds a huge amount
those for example are mark iv british tanks from
they had two machine guns and a cannon and they had horsepower ricardo engines
they went five miles an hour and inside it was degrees in the pitch dark
and they had a canary hung inside the thing to make sure the germans werent going to use gas
happy little story isnt it
this is motor ritz towers in manhattan in the where you drove up to your front door if you had the guts
anybody who was anybody had an apartment there
i managed to stick in both the zeppelin and an ocean liner out of sheer enthusiasm
and i love cigars theres a cigar billboard down there
and faux nostalgia works even in serious subjects like war
this is those wonderful days of the battle of britain in when a messerschmitt bursts into the house of commons and buzzes around just to piss off churchill whos down there somewhere
its a fond memory of times past
hyperbolic overkill is a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute ultimate limit just for the fun of it this was a piece i did a brochure again rms tyrannic the biggest thing in all the world
the copy which you cant see because it goes on and on for several pages says that steerage passengers cant get their to bunks before the voyage is over and its so safe it carries no insurance
its obviously modeled on the titanic
but its not a cri de coeur about mans hubris in the face of the elements
its just a sick silly joke
shamelessly cheap is something i think this will wake you up
it has no meaning just desoto discovers the mississippi and its a desoto discovering the mississippi
i did that as a quick back page i had like four hours to do a back page for an issue of the lampoon and i did that and i thought well im ashamed i hope nobody knows it
people wrote in for reprints of that thing
urban absurdism thats what the new yorker really calls for
i try to make life in new york look even weirder than it is with those covers
ive done about of them and id say of them are based on that concept
i was driving down avenue one night at a m and this steam pouring out of the street and i thought what causes that and that who s to say
the temple of dendur at the metropolitan in new york its a very somber place
i thought i could jazz it up a bit have a little fun with it
this is a very un pc cover not in new york
i couldnt resist and i got a nasty email from some environmental group saying this is too serious and solemn to make fun of you should be ashamed please apologize on our website
havent got around to it yet but i may
this is the word side of my brain
i love the word eurotrash
thats all the eurotrash coming through jfk customs
this was the new york bike messenger meeting the tour de france
if you live in new york you know how the bike messengers move
except that hes carrying a tube for blueprints and stuff they all do and a lot of people thought that meant it was a terrorist about to shoot rockets at the tour de france sign of our times i guess
this is the only fashion cover ive ever done
its the little old lady that lives in a shoe and then this thing the title of that was there goes the neighborhood
i dont know a hell of a lot about fashion i was told to do what they call a mary jane and then i got into this terrible fight between the art director and the editor saying put a strap on it no dont put a strap on it put a strap on it dont put a strap on it because it obscures the logo and looks terrible and its bad and i finally chickened out and did it for the sake of the authenticity of the shoe
this is a tiny joke e zr pass one letter makes an idea
this is a big joke
this is the audition for king kong
people always ask me where do you get your ideas how do your ideas come
truth about that one is i had a horrible red wine hangover in the middle of the night this came to me like a xerox all i had to do was write it down
it was perfectly clear i didnt do any thinking about it
and then when it ran a lovely lady an old lady named mrs edgar rosenberg if you know that name called me and said she loved the cover it was so sweet
her former name was fay wray and so that was i didnt have the wit to say take the painting
finally this was a three page cover never done before and i dont think it will ever be done again successive pages in the front of the magazine
its the ascent of man using an escalator and its in three parts
you cant see it all together unfortunately but if you look at it enough you can sort of start to see how it actually starts to move
pretty elegant nothing like a crash to end a joke that completes my oeuvre
i would just like to add a crass commercial i have a kids book coming out in the fall called marvel sandwiches a compendium of all the serious play that ever was and it s going to be available in fine bookstores crummy bookstores tables on the street in october
so thank you very much

so magic is a very introverted field
while scientists regularly publish their latest research we magicians do not like to share our methods and secrets
thats true even amongst peers
but if you look at creative practice as a form of research or art as a form of r amp d for humanity then how could a cyber illusionist like myself share his research
now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic
and about three years ago i started an exercise in openness and inclusiveness by reaching out into the open source software community to create new digital tools for magic tools that could eventually be shared with other artists to start them off further on in the process and to get them to the poetry faster
today id like to show you something which came out of these collaborations
its an augmented reality projection tracking and mapping system or a digital storytelling tool
could we bring down the lights please thank you

title kary mullis a next gen cure for killer infections title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript drug resistant bacteria kills even in top hospitals but now tough infections like staph and anthrax may be in for a surprise nobel winning chemist kary mullis who watched a friend die when powerful antibiotics failed unveils a radical new cure that shows extraordinary promise description
so it was about four years ago five years ago i was sitting on a stage in philadelphia i think it was with a bag similar to this
and i was pulling a molecule out of this bag
and i was saying you dont know this molecule really well but your body knows it extremely well
and i was thinking that your body hated it at the time because we are very immune to this this is called alpha gal epitope
and the fact that pig heart valves have lots of these on them is the reason that you cant transplant a pig heart valve into a person easily
actually our body doesnt hate these
our body loves these it eats them
i mean the cells in our immune system are always hungry
and if an antibody is stuck to one of these things on the cell it means thats food
now i was thinking about that and i said you know weve got this immune response to this ridiculous molecule that we dont make and we see it a lot in other animals and stuff
but i said we cant get rid of it because all the people who tried to transplant heart valves found out you cant get rid of that immunity
and i said why dont you use that
what if i could stick this molecule slap it onto a bacteria that was pathogenic to me that had just invaded my lungs
i mean i could immediately tap into an immune response that was already there where it was not going to take five or six days to develop it it was going to immediately attack whatever this thing was on
it was kind of like the same thing that happens when you like when youre getting stopped for a traffic ticket in l a and the cop drops a bag of marijuana in the back of your car and then charges you for possession of marijuana
its like this very fast very efficient way to get people off the street
so you can take a bacteria that really doesnt make these things at all and if you could clamp these on it really well you have it taken off the street
and for certain bacteria we dont have really efficient ways to do that anymore
our antibiotics are running out
and i mean the world apparently is running out too
so probably it doesnt matter years from now streptococcus and stuff like that will be rampant because we wont be here but if we are were going to need something to do with the bacteria
so i started working with this thing with a bunch of collaborators
and trying to attach this to things that were themselves attached to certain specific target zones bacteria that we dont like
and i feel now like george bush
its like mission accomplished
so i might be doing something dumb just like he was doing at the time
but basically what i was talking about there weve now gotten to work
and its killing bacteria its eating them
this thing can be stuck like that little green triangle up there sort of symbolizing this right now
you can stick this to something called a dna aptamer
and that dna aptamer will attach specifically to a target that you have selected for it
so you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you dont like like staphylococcus i dont like it in particular because it killed a professor friend of mine last year
it doesnt respond to antibiotics so i dont like it
and im making an aptamer that will have this attached to it
that will know how to find staph when its in your body and will alert your immune system to go after it
heres what happened see that line on the very top with the little dots
thats a bunch of mice that had been poisoned by our scientist friends down in texas at brooks air base with anthrax
and they had also been treated with a drug that we made that would attack anthrax in particular and direct your immune system to it
youll notice they all lived the ones on the top line thats a percent survival rate
and they actually lived another days or when we finally killed them and took them apart and figured out what went wrong
why did they not die
and they didnt die because they didnt have anthrax anymore
so we did it okay
mission accomplished

title hans rosling global population growth box by box title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript the worlds population will grow to billion over the next years and only by raising the living standards of the poorest can we check population growth this is the paradoxical answer that hans rosling unveils at ted cannes using colorful new data display technology description
i still remember the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people and that was in
im going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future but i will not use digital technology as ive done during my first five tedtalks
instead i have progressed and i am today launching a brand new analog teaching technology that i picked up from ikea this box
this box contains one billion people
and our teacher told us that the industrialized world had one billion people
in the developing world she said they had two billion people
and they lived away then
there was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world
in the industrialized world people were healthy educated rich and they had small families
and their aspiration was to buy a car
and in all swedes were saving to try to buy a volvo like this
this was the economic level at which sweden was
but in contrast to this in the developing world far away the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day
they were saving to be able to buy a pair of shoes
there was an enormous gap in the world when i grew up
and this gap between the west and the rest has created a mindset of the world which we still use linguistically when we talk about the west and the developing world
but the world has changed and its overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world and to understand it
and thats what im going to show you because since what has happened in the world up to is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population
just look how many
the world population has doubled since i went to school
and of course theres been economic growth in the west
a lot of companies have happened to grow the economy so the western population moved over to here
and now their aspiration is not only to have a car
now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination and they want to fly
so this is where they are today
and the most successful of the developing countries they have moved on you know and they have become emerging economies we call them
they are now buying cars
and what happened a month ago was that the chinese company geely they acquired the volvo company and then finally the swedes understood that something big had happened in the world
so there they are
and the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes they are still almost as poor as they were years ago
the new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions the three billions here which are also becoming emerging economies because they are quite healthy relatively well educated and they already also have two to three children per woman as those have
and their aspiration now is of course to buy a bicycle and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also
but this is the world we have today no longer any gap
but the distance from the poorest here the very poorest to the very richest over here is wider than ever
but there is a continuous world from walking biking driving flying there are people on all levels and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle
this is the new world we have today in
and what will happen in the future
well im going to project into
i was in shanghai recently and i listened to whats happening in china and its pretty sure that they will catch up just as japan did
all the projections this one will grow with one to two or three percent
grows with seven eight percent and then they will end up here
they will start flying
and these lower or middle income countries the emerging income countries they will also forge forwards economically
and if but only if we invest in the right green technology so that we can avoid severe climate change and energy can still be relatively cheap then they will move all the way up here
and they will start to buy electric cars
this is what we will find there
so what about the poorest two billion
what about the poorest two billion here
will they move on
well here population comes in because there we already have two to three children per woman family planning is widely used and population growth is coming to an end
here population is growing
so these two billion will in the next decades increase to three billion and they will thereafter increase to four billion
there is nothing but a nuclear war of a kind weve never seen that can stop this from happening
because we already have this in process
but if and only if get out of poverty they get education they get improved child survival they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come here then population growth will stop in
we cannot have people on this level looking for food and shoes because then we get continued population growth
and let me show you why by converting back to the old time digital technology
here i have on the screen my country bubbles
every bubble is a country the size is population
the colors show the continent
the yellow on there is the americas dark blue is africa brown is europe green is the middle east and this light blue is south asia
thats india and this is china size is population
here i have children per woman two children four children six children eight children big families small families
the year is
and down here child survival the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school percent percent percent and almost percent as we have today in the wealthiest and healthiest countries
but look this is the world my teacher talked about in one billion western world here high child survival small families and all the rest the rainbow of developing countries with very large families and poor child survival
what has happened i start the world here we go
can you see as the years pass by child survival is increasing
they get soap hygiene education vaccination penicillin and then family planning family size is decreasing
they get up to percent child survival then families decrease and most of the arab countries in the middle east is falling down there
look bangladesh catching up with india
the whole emerging world joins the western world with good child survival and small family size but we still have the poorest billion
can you see the poorest billion those boxes i had over here
they are still up here
and they still have a child survival of only to percent meaning that if you have six children born there will be at least four who survive to the next generation
and the population will double in one generation
so the only way of really getting world population to stop is to continue to improve child survival to percent
thats why investments by gates foundation unicef and aid organizations together with national government in the poorest countries are so good because they are actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world
we can stop at nine billion if we do the right things
child survival is the new green
its only by child survival that we will stop population growth
and will it happen
well im not an optimist neither am i a pessimist
im a very serious possibilist
its a new category where we take emotion apart and we just work analytically with the world
it can be done
we can have a much more just world
with green technology and with investments to alleviate poverty and global governance the world can become like this
and look at the position of the old west
remember when this blue box was all alone leading the world living its own life
this will not happen
the role of the old west in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world nothing more nothing less
but its a very important role
do it well and get used to it
thank you very much

description ted talk subtitles and transcript ipad storyteller joe sabia introduces us to lothar meggendorfer who created a bold technology for storytelling the pop up book sabia shows how new technology has always helped us tell our own stories from the walls of caves to his own onstage ipad description
ladies and gentlemen gather around
i would love to share with you a story
once upon a time in century germany there was the book
now during this time the book was the king of storytelling
it was venerable
it was ubiquitous
but it was a little bit boring
because in its years of existence storytellers never evolved the book as a storytelling device
but then one author arrived and he changed the game forever
his name was lothar lothar meggendorfer
lothar meggendorfer put his foot down and he said genug ist genug
he grabbed his pen he snatched his scissors
this man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold
history would know lothar meggendorfer as who else the worlds first true inventor of the childrens pop up book
for this delight and for this wonder people rejoiced
they were happy because the story survived and that the world would keep on spinning
lothar meggendorfer wasnt the first to evolve the way a story was told and he certainly wasnt the last
whether storytellers realized it or not they were channeling meggendorfers spirit when they moved opera to vaudville radio news to radio theater film to film in motion to film in sound color on vhs and on dvd
there seemed to be no cure for this meggendorferitis
and things got a lot more fun when the internet came around
because not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world but they could do so using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices
for example one company would tell a story of love through its very own search engine
one taiwanese production studio would interpret american politics in
and one man would tell the stories of his father by using a platform called twitter to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate
and after all this everyone paused they took a step back
they realized that in years of storytelling theyve gone from depicting hunting on cave walls to depicting shakespeare on facebook walls
and this was a cause for celebration
the art of storytelling has remained unchanged
and for the most part the stories are recycled
but the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with pure consistent novelty
and they remembered a man one amazing german every time a new storytelling device popped up next
and for that the audience the lovely beautiful audience would live happily ever after

title jeff smith lessons in business from prison title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript jeff smith spent a year in prison but what he discovered inside wasn t what he expected he saw in his fellow inmates boundless ingenuity and business savvy he asks why dont we tap this entrepreneurial potential to help ex prisoners contribute to society once theyre back outside description
b j was one of many fellow inmates who had big plans for the future
he had a vision when he got out he was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight and he was actually working on merging his two passions into one vision
hed spent dollars to buy a website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars
it was my first week in federal prison and i was learning quickly that it wasnt what you see on tv
in fact it was teeming with smart ambitious men whose business instincts were in many cases as sharp as those of the ceos who had wined and dined me six months earlier when i was a rising star in the missouri senate
now percent of the guys that i was locked up with had been drug dealers on the outside but when they talked about what they did they talked about it in a different jargon but the business concepts that they talked about werent unlike those that youd learn in a first year mba class at wharton promotional incentives you never charge a first time user focus grouping new product launches territorial expansion
but they didnt spend a lot of time reliving the glory days
for the most part everyone was just trying to survive
its a lot harder than you might think
contrary to what most people think people dont pay taxpayers dont pay for your life when youre in prison youve got to pay for your own life
youve got to pay for your soap your deodorant toothbrush toothpaste all of it
and its hard for a couple of reasons
first everythings marked up to percent from what youd pay on the street and second you dont make a lot of money
i unloaded trucks that was my full time job unloading trucks at a food warehouse for not an hour but per month
so how do you survive
well you learn to hustle all kinds of hustles
theres legal hustles
you pay everything in stamps those are the currency
you charge another inmate to clean his cell
theres sort of illegal hustles like you run a barbershop out of your cell
theres pretty illegal hustles you run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell
and theres very illegal hustles which you smuggle in you get smuggled in drugs pornography cell phones and just as in the outer world theres a risk reward tradeoff so the riskier the enterprise the more profitable it can potentially be
you want a cigarette in prison three to five dollars
you want an old fashioned cell phone that you flip open and is about as big as your head three hundred bucks
you want a dirty magazine
well it can be as much as dollars
so as you can probably tell one of the defining aspects of prison life is ingenuity
whether it was concocting delicious meals from stolen scraps from the warehouse sculpting peoples hair with toenail clippers or constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags tied on to tree limbs prisoners learn how to make do with less and many of them want to take this ingenuity that theyve learned to the outside and start restaurants barber shops personal training businesses
but theres no training nothing to prepare them for that no rehabilitation at all in prison no one to help them write a business plan figure out a way to translate the business concepts they intuitively grasp into legal enterprises no access to the internet even
and then when they come out most states dont even have a law prohibiting employers from discriminating against people with a background
so none of us should be surprised that two out of three ex offenders re offend within five years
look i lied to the feds i lost a year of my life from it
but when i came out i vowed that i was going to do whatever i could to make sure that guys like the ones i was locked up with didnt have to waste any more of their life than they already had
so i hope that youll think about helping in some way
the best thing we can do is figure out ways to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit and the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons because if we dont theyre not going to learn any new skills thats going to help them and theyll be right back
all theyll learn on the inside is new hustles
thank you

title alex laskey how behavioral science can lower your energy bill title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript whats a proven way to lower your energy costs would you believe learning what your neighbor pays alex laskey shows how a quirk of human behavior can make us all better wiser energy users with lower bills to prove it description
how many of you have checked your email today
come on raise your hands
how many of you are checking it right now
and how about finances anybody check that today
credit card investment account
how about this week
now how about your household energy use
anybody check that today
this week last week
a few energy geeks spread out across the room
its good to see you guys
but the rest of us this is a room filled with people who are passionate about the future of this planet and even we arent paying attention to the energy use thats driving climate change
the woman in the photo with me is harriet
we met her on our first family vacation
harriets paying attention to her energy use and she is decidedly not an energy geek
this is the story of how harriet came to pay attention
this is coal the most common source of electricity on the planet and theres enough energy in this coal to light this bulb for more than a year
but unfortunately between here and here most of that energy is lost to things like transmission leakage and heat
in fact only percent ends up as light
so this coal will last a little bit more than a month
if you wanted to light this bulb for a year youd need this much coal
the bad news here is that for every unit of energy we use we waste nine
that means theres good news because for every unit of energy we save we save the other nine
so the question is how can we get the people in this room and across the globe to start paying attention to the energy were using and start wasting less of it
the answer comes from a behavioral science experiment that was run one hot summer years ago and only miles from here in san marcos california
graduate students put signs on every door in a neighborhood asking people to turn off their air conditioning and turn on their fans
one quarter of the homes received a message that said did you know you could save dollars a month this summer
turn off your air conditioning turn on your fans
another group got an environmental message
and still a third group got a message about being good citizens preventing blackouts
most people guessed that money saving message would work best of all
in fact none of these messages worked
they had zero impact on energy consumption
it was as if the grad students hadnt shown up at all
but there was a fourth message and this message simply said when surveyed percent of your neighbors said that they turned off their air conditioning and turned on their fans
please join them turn off your air conditioning and turn on your fans
and wouldnt you know it they did
the people who received this message showed a marked decrease in energy consumption simply by being told what their neighbors were doing
so what does this tell us
well if something is inconvenient even if we believe in it moral suasion financial incentives dont do much to move us but social pressure thats powerful stuff
and harnessed correctly it can be a powerful force for good
in fact it already is
inspired by this insight my friend dan yates and i started a company called opower
we built software and partnered with utility companies who wanted to help their customers save energy
we deliver personalized home energy reports that show people how their consumption compares to their neighbors in similar sized homes
just like those effective door hangers we have people comparing themselves to their neighbors and then we give everyone targeted recommendations to help them save
we started with paper we moved to a mobile application web and now even a controllable thermostat and for the last five years weve been running the largest behavioral science experiment in the world
and its working
ordinary homeowners and renters have saved more than million dollars on their energy bills and were just getting started
this year alone in partnership with more than utilities in six countries were going to generate another two terawatt hours of electricity savings
now the energy geeks in the room know two terawatt hours but for the rest of us two terawatt hours is more than enough energy to power every home in st louis and salt lake city combined for more than a year
two terawatt hours its roughly half what the u s solar industry produced last year
and two terawatt hours in terms of coal wed need to burn of these wheelbarrows every minute around the clock every day for an entire year to get two terawatt hours of electricity
and were not burning anything
were just motivating people to pay attention and change their behavior
but were just one company and this is just scratching the surface
twenty percent of the electricity in homes is wasted and when i say wasted i dont mean that people have inefficient lightbulbs they may
i mean we leave the lights on in empty rooms and we leave the air conditioning on when nobodys home
thats billion dollars a year wasted on electricity that does not contribute to our well being but does contribute to climate change
thats billion with a b every year in the u s alone
thats half our coal usage right there
now thankfully some of the worlds best material scientists are looking to replace coal with sustainable resources like these and this is both fantastic and essential
but the most overlooked resource to get us to a sustainable energy future it isnt on this slide
its in this room its you and its me
and we can harness this resource with no new material science simply by applying behavioral science
we can do it today we know it works and it will save us money right away
so what are we waiting for
well in most places utility regulation hasnt changed much since thomas edison
utilities are still rewarded when their customers waste energy
they ought to be rewarded for helping their customers save it
but this story is much more than about household energy use
take a look at the prius
its efficient not only because toyota invested in material science but because they invested in behavioral science
the dashboard that shows drivers how much energy theyre saving in real time makes former speed demons drive more like cautious grandmothers
which brings us back to harriet
we met her on our first family vacation
she came over to meet my young daughter and she was tickled to learn that my daughters name is also harriet
she asked me what i did for a living and i told her i work with utilities to help people save energy
it was then that her eyes lit up
she looked at me and she said youre exactly the person i need to talk to
you see two weeks ago my husband and i got a letter in the mail from our utility
it told us we were using twice as much energy as our neighbors
and for the last two weeks all we can think about talk about and even argue about is what we should be doing to save energy
we did everything that letter told us to do and still i know there must be more
now im here with a genuine expert
tell me what should i do to save energy
there are many experts who can help answer harriets question
my goal is to make sure we are all asking it
thank you

title ami klin a new way to diagnose autism title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder can improve the lives of everyone affected but the complex network of causes make it incredibly difficult to predict at tedxpeachtree ami klin describes a new early detection method that uses eye tracking technologies to gauge babies social engagement skills and reliably measure their risk of developing autism description
i always wanted to become a walking laboratory of social engagement to resonate other peoples feelings thoughts intentions motivations in the act of being with them
as a scientist i always wanted to measure that resonance that sense of the other that happens so quickly in the blink of an eye
we intuit other peoples feelings
we know the meaning of their actions even before they happen
were always in this stance of being the object of somebody elses subjectivity
we do that all the time we just cant shake it off
its so important that the very tools that we use to understand ourselves to understand the world around them is shaped by that stance
we are social to the core
so my journey in autism really started when i lived in a residential unit for adults with autism
most of those individuals had spent most of their lives in long stay hospitals this is a long time ago
and for them autism was devastating
they had profound intellectual disabilities
they didnt talk but most of all they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them from their environment and from the people
in fact at the time if you walked into a school for individuals with autism youd hear a lot of noise plenty of commotion actions people doing things but theyre always doing things by themselves
so they may be looking at a light in the ceiling or they may be isolated in the corner or they might be engaged in these repetitive movements in self stimulatory movements that led them nowhere
extremely extremely isolated
well now we know that autism is this disruption the disruption of this resonance that i am telling you
these are survival skills
these are survival skills that we inherited over many many hundreds of thousands of years of evolution
you see babies are born in a state of utter fragility
without the caregiver they wouldnt survive so it stands to reason that nature would endow them with these mechanisms of survival
they orient to the caregiver
from the first days and weeks of life babies prefer to hear human sounds rather than just sounds in the environment
they prefer to look at people rather than at things and even as theyre looking at people they look at peoples eyes because the eye is the window to the other persons experiences so much so that they even prefer to look at people who are looking at them rather than people who are looking away
well they orient to the caregiver
the caregiver seeks the baby
and its out of this mutually reinforcing choreography that a lot that is of importance to the emergence of mind the social mind the social brain depends on
we always think about autism as something that happens later on in life
it doesnt it begins with the beginning of life
as babies engage with caregivers they soon realize that well there is something in between the ears that is very important its invisible you cant see but is really critical and that thing is called attention
and they learn soon enough even before they can utter one word that they can take that attention and move somewhere in order to get things they want
they also learn to follow other peoples gaze because whatever people are looking at is what they are thinking about
and soon enough they start to learn about the meaning of things because when somebody is looking at something or somebody is pointing at something theyre not just getting a directional cue they are getting the other persons meaning of that thing the attitude and soon enough they start building this body of meanings but meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction
those are meanings that are acquired as part of their shared experiences with others
well this is a little month old little girl and she has autism
and i am coming so close to her that i am maybe two inches from her face and shes quite oblivious to me
imagine if i did that to you and i came two inches from your face
youd do probably two things wouldnt you
you would recoil you would call the police
you would do something because its literally impossible to penetrate somebodys physical space and not get a reaction
we do so remember intuitively effortlessly
this is our body wisdom its not something that is mediated by our language our body just knows that and weve known that for a long time
and this is not something that happens to humans only
it happens to some of our phylatic cousins because if youre a monkey and you look at another monkey and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you and that is considered to be a signal or threat well you are not going to be alive for long
so something that in other species are survival mechanisms without them they wouldnt basically live we bring into the context of human beings and this is what we need to simply act act socially
now she is oblivious to me and i am so close to her and you think maybe she can see you maybe she can hear you
well a few minutes later she goes to the corner of the room and she finds a tiny little piece of candy an m amp m
so i could not attract her attention but something a thing did
now most of us make a big dichotomy between the world of things and the world of people
now for this girl that division line is not so clear and the world of people is not attracting her as much as we would like
now remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences
now what she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging moment by moment as she is isolating herself further and further
so we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic the brain determines who we are going to be
but in fact the brain also becomes who we are and at the same time that her behaviors are taking away from the realm of social interaction this is whats happening with her mind and this is whats happening with her brain
well autism is the most strongly genetic condition of all developmental disorders and its a brain disorder
its a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born
we now know that there is a very broad spectrum of autism
there are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled but there are those that are gifted
there are those individuals who dont talk at all
there are those individuals who talk too much
there are those individuals that if you observe them in their school you see them running the periphery fence of the school all day if you let them to those individuals who cannot stop coming to you and trying to engage you repeatedly relentlessly but often in an awkward fashion without that immediate resonance
well this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time
when i started in this field we thought that there were four individuals with autism per a very rare condition
well now we know its more like one in
there are millions of individuals with autism all around us
the societal cost of this condition is huge
in the u s alone maybe to billion dollars and you know what most of those funds are associated with adolescents and particularly adults who are severely disabled individuals who need wrap around services services that are very very intensive and those services can cost in excess of to dollars a year
those are individuals who did not benefit from early treatment because now we know that autism creates itself as they diverge in that pathway of learning that i mentioned to you
were we to be able to identify this condition at an earlier point and intervene and treat i can tell you and this has been probably something that has changed my life in the past years this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition
also we have a window of opportunity because the brain is malleable for just so long and that window of opportunity happens in the first three years of life
its not that that window closes it doesnt
but it diminishes considerably
and yet the median age of diagnosis in this country is still about five years and in disadvantaged populations the populations that dont have access to clinical services rural populations minorities the age of diagnosis is later still which is almost as if i were to tell you that we are condemning those communities to have individuals with autism whose condition is going to be more severe
so i feel that we have a bio ethical imperative
the science is there but no science is of relevance if it doesnt have an impact on the community and we just cant afford that missed opportunity because children with autism become adults with autism and we feel that those things that we can do for these children for those families early on will have lifetime consequences for the child for the family and for the community at large
so this is our view of autism
there are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism in fact we believe that there are going to be something between and genes associated with autism and genetic anomalies much more than just genes
and we actually have a bit of a question here because if there are so many different causes of autism how do you go from those liabilities to the actual syndrome because people like myself when we walk into a playroom we recognize a child as having autism
so how do you go from multiple causes to a syndrome that has some homogeneity
and the answer is what lies in between which is development
and in fact we are very interested in those first two years of life because those liabilities dont necessarily convert into autism
autism creates itself
were we to be able to intervene during those years of life we might attenuate for some and god knows maybe even prevent for others
so how do we do that
how do we enter that feeling of resonance how do we enter another persons being
i remember when i interacted with that month older that the thing that came to mind was how do you come into her world
is she thinking about me is she thinking about others
well its hard to do that so we had to create the technologies we had to basically step inside a body
we had to see the world through her eyes
and so in the past many years weve been building these new technologies that are based on eye tracking
we can see moment by moment what children are engaging with
well this is my colleague warren jones with whom weve been building these methods these studies for the past years and you see there a happy five month older its a five month little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from his world his mom the caregiver but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his daycare
what we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory but in order for us to do that we had to create these very sophisticated measures measures of how people how little babies how newborns engage with the world moment by moment what is important and what is not
well we created those measures and here what you see is what we call a funnel of attention
youre watching a video
those frames are separated by about a second through the eyes of typically developing two year olds and we freeze one frame and this is what the typical children are doing
in this scan pass in green here are two year olds with autism
so on that frame the children who are typical are watching this the emotion of expression of that little boy as hes fighting a little bit with the little girl
what are the children with autism doing
they are focusing on the revolving door opening and shutting
well i can tell you that this divergence that youre seeing here doesnt happen only in our five minute experiment
it happens moment by moment in their real lives and their minds are being formed and their brains are being specialized in something other than what is happening with their typical peers
well we took a construct from our pediatrician friends the concept of growth charts
you know when you take a child to the pediatrician and so you have physical height and weight
well we decided that were going to create growth charts of social engagement and we sought children from the time that they are born and what you see here on the x axis is two three four five six months and nine until about the age of months and this is the percent of their viewing time that they are focusing on peoples eyes and this is their growth chart
they start over here they love peoples eyes and it remains quite stable
it sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months
now lets see whats happening with babies who became autistic
its something very different
it starts way up here but then its a free fall
its very much like they brought into this world the reflex that orients them to people but it has no traction
its almost as if that stimulus you youre not exerting influence on what happens as they navigate their daily lives
now we thought that those data were so powerful in a way that we wanted to see what happened in the first six months of life because if you interact with a two and a three month older youd be surprised by how social those babies are
and what we see in the first six months of life is that those two groups can be segregated very easily
and using these kinds of measures and many others what we found out is that our science could in fact identify this condition early on
we didnt have to wait for the behaviors of autism to emerge in the second year of life
if we measured things that are evolutionarily highly conserved and developmentally very early emerging things that are online from the first weeks of life we could push the detection of autism all the way to those first months and thats what we are doing now
now we can create the very best technologies and the very best methods to identify the children but this would be for naught if we didnt have an impact on what happens in their reality in the community
now we want those devices of course to be deployed by those who are in the trenches our colleagues the primary care physicians who see every child and we need to transform those technologies into something that is going to add value to their practice because they have to see so many children
and we want to do that universally so that we dont miss any child but this would be immoral if we also did not have an infrastructure for intervention for treatment
we need to be able to work with the families to support the families to manage those first years with them we need to be able to really go from universal screening to universal access to treatment because those treatments are going to change these childrens and those families lives
now when we think about what we do in those first years i can tell you having been in this field for so long one feels really rejuvenated
there is a sense that the science that one worked on can actually have an impact on realities preventing in fact those experiences that i really started in my journey in this field
i thought at the time that this was an intractable condition
no longer we can do a great deal of things
and the idea is not to cure autism
thats not the idea
what we want is to make sure that those individuals with autism can be free from the devastating consequences that come with it at times the profound intellectual disabilities the lack of language the profound profound isolation
we feel that individuals with autism in fact have a very special perspective on the world and we need diversity and they can work extremely well in some areas of strength predictable situations situations that can be defined
because after all they learn about the world almost like about it rather than learning how to function in it
but this is a strength if youre working for example in technology
and there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities
we want them to be free of that
we want that the next generations of individuals with autism will be able not only to express their strengths but to fulfill their promise
well thank you for listening to me

title bruce feiler agile programming for your family title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript bruce feiler has a radical idea to deal with the stress of modern family life go agile inspired by agile software programming feiler introduces family practices which encourage flexibility bottom up idea flow constant feedback and accountability one surprising feature kids pick their own punishments description
so heres the good news about families
the last years have seen a revolution in what it means to be a family
we have blended families adopted families we have nuclear families living in separate houses and divorced families living in the same house
but through it all the family has grown stronger
eight in say the family they have today is as strong or stronger than the family they grew up in
now heres the bad news
nearly everyone is completely overwhelmed by the chaos of family life
every parent i know myself included feels like were constantly playing defense
just when our kids stop teething they start having tantrums
just when they stop needing our help taking a bath they need our help dealing with cyberstalking or bullying
and heres the worst news of all
our children sense were out of control
ellen galinsky of the families and work institute asked children if you were granted one wish about your parents what would it be
the parents predicted the kids would say spending more time with them
they were wrong the kids number one wish
that their parents be less tired and less stressed
so how can we change this dynamic
are there concrete things we can do to reduce stress draw our family closer and generally prepare our children to enter the world
i spent the last few years trying to answer that question traveling around meeting families talking to scholars experts ranging from elite peace negotiators to warren buffetts bankers to the green berets
i was trying to figure out what do happy families do right and what can i learn from them to make my family happier
i want to tell you about one family that i met and why i think they offer clues
at p m on a sunday in hidden springs idaho where the six members of the starr family are sitting down to the highlight of their week the family meeting
the starrs are a regular american family with their share of regular american family problems
david is a software engineer eleanor takes care of their four children ages to
one of those kids tutors math on the far side of town
one has lacrosse on the near side of town
one has asperger syndrome one has adhd
we were living in complete chaos eleanor said
what the starrs did next though was surprising
instead of turning to friends or relatives they looked to davids workplace
they turned to a cutting edge program called agile development that was just spreading from manufacturers in japan to startups in silicon valley
in agile workers are organized into small groups and do things in very short spans of time
so instead of having executives issue grand proclamations the team in effect manages itself
you have constant feedback you have daily update sessions
you have weekly reviews youre constantly changing
david said when they brought this system into their home the family meetings in particular increased communication decreased stress and made everybody happier to be part of the family team
when my wife and i adopted these family meetings and other techniques into the lives of our then five year old twin daughters it was the biggest single change we made since our daughters were born
and these meetings had this effect while taking under minutes
so what is agile and why can it help with something that seems so different like families
in jeff sutherland was a technologist at a financial firm in new england
he was very frustrated with how software got designed
companies followed the waterfall method right in which executives issued orders that slowly trickled down to programmers below and no one had ever consulted the programmers
eighty three percent of projects failed
they were too bloated or too out of date by the time they were done
sutherland wanted to create a system where ideas didnt just percolate down but could percolate up from the bottom and be adjusted in real time
he read years of harvard business review before stumbling upon an article in called the new new product development game
it said that the pace of business was quickening and by the way this was in and the most successful companies were flexible
it highlighted toyota and canon and likened their adaptable tight knit teams to rugby scrums
as sutherland told me we got to that article and said thats it
in sutherlands system companies dont use large massive projects that take two years
they do things in small chunks
nothing takes longer than two weeks
so instead of saying you guys go off into that bunker and come back with a cell phone or a social network you say you go off and come up with one element then bring it back lets talk about it lets adapt
you succeed or fail quickly
today agile is used in a hundred countries and its sweeping into management suites
inevitably people began taking some of these techniques and applying it to their families
you had blogs pop up and some manuals were written
even the sutherlands told me that they had an agile thanksgiving where you had one group of people working on the food one setting the table and one greeting visitors at the door
sutherland said it was the best thanksgiving ever
so lets take one problem that families face crazy mornings and talk about how agile can help
a key plank is accountability so teams use information radiators these large boards in which everybody is accountable
so the starrs in adapting this to their home created a morning checklist in which each child is expected to tick off chores
so on the morning i visited eleanor came downstairs poured herself a cup of coffee sat in a reclining chair and she sat there kind of amiably talking to each of her children as one after the other they came downstairs checked the list made themselves breakfast checked the list again put the dishes in the dishwasher rechecked the list fed the pets or whatever chores they had checked the list once more gathered their belongings and made their way to the bus
it was one of the most astonishing family dynamics i have ever seen
and when i strenuously objected this would never work in our house our kids needed way too much monitoring eleanor looked at me
thats what i thought she said
i told david keep your work out of my kitchen but i was wrong
so i turned to david so why does it work
he said you cant underestimate the power of doing this
and he made a checkmark
he said in the workplace adults love it
with kids its heaven
the week we introduced a morning checklist into our house it cut parental screaming in half
but the real change didnt come until we had these family meetings
so following the agile model we ask three questions what worked well in our family this week what didnt work well and what will we agree to work on in the week ahead
everyone throws out suggestions and then we pick two to focus on
and suddenly the most amazing things started coming out of our daughters mouths
what worked well this week
getting over our fear of riding bikes making our beds
what didnt work well our math sheets or greeting visitors at the door
like a lot of parents our kids are something like bermuda triangles
like thoughts and ideas go in but none ever comes out i mean at least not that are revealing
this gave us access suddenly to their innermost thoughts
but the most surprising part was when we turned to what are we going to work on in the week ahead
you know the key idea of agile is that teams essentially manage themselves and it works in software and it turns out that it works with kids
our kids love this process
so they would come up with all these ideas
you know greet five visitors at the door this week get an extra minutes of reading before bed
kick someone lose desserts for a month
it turns out by the way our girls are little stalins
we constantly have to kind of dial them back
now look naturally theres a gap between their kind of conduct in these meetings and their behavior the rest of the week but the truth is it didnt really bother us
it felt like we were kind of laying these underground cables that wouldnt light up their world for many years to come
three years later our girls are almost eight now were still holding these meetings
my wife counts them among her most treasured moments as a mom
so what did we learn
the word agile entered the lexicon in when jeff sutherland and a group of designers met in utah and wrote a point agile manifesto
i think the time is right for an agile family manifesto
ive taken some ideas from the starrs and from many other families i met
im proposing three planks
plank number one adapt all the time
when i became a parent i figured you know what
well set a few rules and well stick to them
that assumes as parents we can anticipate every problem thats going to arise
we cant whats great about the agile system is you build in a system of change so that you can react to whats happening to you in real time
its like they say in the internet world if youre doing the same thing today you were doing six months ago youre doing the wrong thing
parents can learn a lot from that
but to me adapt all the time means something deeper too
we have to break parents out of this straitjacket that the only ideas we can try at home are ones that come from shrinks or self help gurus or other family experts
the truth is their ideas are stale whereas in all these other worlds there are these new ideas to make groups and teams work effectively
lets just take a few examples
lets take the biggest issue of all family dinner
everybody knows that having family dinner with your children is good for the kids
but for so many of us it doesnt work in our lives
i met a celebrity chef in new orleans who said no problem ill just time shift family dinner
im not home cant make family dinner
well have family breakfast well meet for a bedtime snack
well make sunday meals more important
and the truth is recent research backs him up
it turns out theres only minutes of productive time in any family meal
the rest of its taken up with take your elbows off the table and pass the ketchup
you can take that minutes and move it to any part of the day and have the same benefit
so time shift family dinner thats adaptability
an environmental psychologist told me if youre sitting in a hard chair on a rigid surface youll be more rigid
if youre sitting on a cushioned chair youll be more open
she told me when youre discipling your children sit in an upright chair with a cushioned surface
the conversation will go better
my wife and i actually moved where we sit for difficult conversations because i was sitting above in the power position
so move where you sit thats adaptability
the point is there are all these new ideas out there
weve got to hook them up with parents
so plank number one adapt all the time
be flexible be open minded let the best ideas win
plank number two empower your children
our instinct as parents is to order our kids around
its easier and frankly were usually right
theres a reason that few systems have been more waterfall over time than the family
but the single biggest lesson we learned is to reverse the waterfall as much as possible
enlist the children in their own upbringing
just yesterday we were having our family meeting and we had voted to work on overreacting
so we said okay give us a reward and give us a punishment okay
so one of my daughters threw out you get five minutes of overreacting time all week
so we kind of liked that
but then her sister started working the system
she said do i get one five minute overreaction or can i get second overreactions
i loved that spend the time however you want
now give us a punishment okay
if we get minutes of overreaction time thats the limit
every minute above that we have to do one pushup
so you see this is working now look this system isnt lax
theres plenty of parental authority going on
but were giving them practice becoming independent which of course is our ultimate goal
just as i was leaving to come here tonight one of my daughters started screaming
the other one said overreaction overreaction
and started counting and within seconds it had ended
to me that is a certified agile miracle
and by the way research backs this up too
children who plan their own goals set weekly schedules evaluate their own work build up their frontal cortex and take more control over their lives
the point is we have to let our children succeed on their own terms and yes on occasion fail on their own terms
i was talking to warren buffetts banker and he was chiding me for not letting my children make mistakes with their allowance
and i said but what if they drive into a ditch
he said its much better to drive into a ditch with a allowance than a a year salary or a million inheritance
so the bottom line is empower your children
plank number three tell your story
adaptability is fine but we also need bedrock
jim collins the author of good to great told me that successful human organizations of any kind have two things in common they preserve the core they stimulate progress
so agile is great for stimulating progress but i kept hearing time and again you need to preserve the core
so how do you do that
collins coached us on doing something that businesses do which is define your mission and identify your core values
so he led us through the process of creating a family mission statement
we did the family equivalent of a corporate retreat
we had a pajama party
i made popcorn actually i burned one so i made two
my wife bought a flip chart
and we had this great conversation like whats important to us
what values do we most uphold
and we ended up with statements
we are travelers not tourists
we dont like dilemmas we like solutions
again research shows that parents should spend less time worrying about what they do wrong and more time focusing on what they do right worry less about the bad times and build up the good times
this family mission statement is a great way to identify what it is that you do right
a few weeks later we got a call from the school
one of our daughters had gotten into a spat
and suddenly we were worried like do we have a mean girl on our hands
and we didnt really know what to do so we called her into my office
the family mission statement was on the wall and my wife said so anything up there seem to apply
and she kind of looked down the list and she said bring people together
suddenly we had a way into the conversation
another great way to tell your story is to tell your children where they came from
researchers at emory gave children a simple what do you know test
do you know where your grandparents were born
do you know where your parents went to high school
do you know anybody in your family who had a difficult situation an illness and they overcame it
the children who scored highest on this do you know scale had the highest self esteem and a greater sense they could control their lives
the do you know test was the single biggest predictor of emotional health and happiness
as the author of the study told me children who have a sense of theyre part of a larger narrative have greater self confidence
so my final plank is tell your story
spend time retelling the story of your familys positive moments and how you overcame the negative ones
if you give children this happy narrative you give them the tools to make themselves happier
i was a teenager when i first read anna karenina and its famous opening sentence all happy families are alike
each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way
when i first read that i thought that sentence is inane
of course all happy families arent alike
but as i began working on this project i began changing my mind
recent scholarship has allowed us for the first time to identify the building blocks that successful families have
ive mentioned just three here today adapt all the time empower the children tell your story
is it possible all these years later to say tolstoy was right
the answer i believe is yes
when leo tolstoy was five years old his brother nikolay came to him and said he had engraved the secret to universal happiness on a little green stick which he had hidden in a ravine on the familys estate in russia
if the stick were ever found all humankind would be happy
tolstoy became consumed with that stick but he never found it
in fact he asked to be buried in that ravine where he thought it was hidden
he still lies there today covered in a layer of green grass
that story perfectly captures for me the final lesson that i learned happiness is not something we find its something we make
almost anybody whos looked at well run organizations has come to pretty much the same conclusion
greatness is not a matter of circumstance
its a matter of choice
you dont need some grand plan you dont need a waterfall
you just need to take small steps accumulate small wins keep reaching for that green stick
in the end this may be the greatest lesson of all
whats the secret to a happy family try

title john gerzema the post crisis consumer title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript john gerzema says theres an upside to the recent financial crisis the opportunity for positive change in this talk he identifies four major cultural shifts driving new consumer behavior and shows how businesses are evolving to connect with thoughtful spending description
thirteen trillion dollars in wealth has evaporated over the course of the last two years
weve questioned the future of capitalism
weve questioned the financial industry
weve looked at our government oversight
weve questioned where were going
and yet at the same time this very well may be a seminal moment in american history an opportunity for the consumer to actually take control and guide us to a new trajectory in america
im calling this the great unwind
and the idea is a simple simple idea which is the fact that the consumer has moved from a state of anxiety to action
consumers who represent percent of the gdp of america have actually started just like banks and just like businesses to de leverage to unwind their leverage in daily life to remove themselves from the liability and risk that presents itself as we move forward
so to understand this and im going to stress this its not about the consumer being in retreat
the consumer is empowered
in order to understand this were going to step back and look a little bit at whats happened over the course of the last year and a half
so if youve been gone this is the easy cliffsnotes on whats happened in the economy okay
unemployment up housing values down equity markets down
commodity prices are like this
if youre a mom trying to manage a budget and oil was dollars a barrel last summer and its somewhere between and do you plan vacations how do you buy
what is your strategy in your household
will the bailout work we have national debt detroit currency valuations healthcare all these issues facing us
you put them all together you mix them up in a bouillabaisse and you have consumer confidence thats basically a ticking time bomb
in fact lets go back and look at what caused this crisis because the consumer all of us in our daily lives actually contributed a large part to the problem
this is something i call the paradox
it took us years to reach annual savings ratings of almost percent years
do you know what this was right here
this was world war ii do you know why savings was so high
there was nothing to buy unless you wanted to buy some rivets right
so what happened though over the course of the last years we went from a percent savings rate to a negative savings rate
because we binged we bought extra large cars supersized everything we bought remedies for restless leg syndrome
all these things together basically created a factor where the consumer sort of drove us headlong into the crisis that we face today
the personal debt to income ratio basically went from percent to percent in the span of about years
so consumers got overleveraged
and of course our banks did as well as did our federal government
this is an absolutely staggering chart
it shows leverage trended out from to
and what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging future education future children in our households
so if you look at this in the context of visualizing the bailout what you can see is if you stack up dollar bills first of all dollars is about the size of a five foot four guy
but if you stack it up you just see this amazing staggering amount of dollars that have been put into the system to fund and bail us out
so this is the first billion
but i read this fact the other day that one trillion seconds equals thousand years so if you think about that the context the casualness with which we talk about trillion dollar bailout here and trillion there we are stacking ourselves up for long term leverage
however consumers have moved
they are taking responsibility
what were seeing is an uptake in the savings rate
in fact straight months of savings have happened since the beginning of the crisis
we are working our way back up to that percent
also remarkably in the fourth quarter spending dropped to its lowest level in years almost a percent decline
visa now reports that more people are using debit cards than theyre using credit cards
so were starting to pay for things with money that we have
and were starting to be much more careful about how we save and how we invest
but thats not really the whole story
because this has also been a dramatic time of transformation
and youve got to admit over the course of the last year and a half consumers have been doing some pretty weird things
its been pretty staggering what weve lived through
if you take into account percent of all americans were born after world war ii this is essentially our depression
and so as a result some crazy things have happened
ill give you some examples lets talk about dentists vasectomies guns and shark attacks okay
dentists report molars you know people grinding their teeth coming in and reporting the fact that theyve had stress
and so there is an increase in people having to have their fillings replaced
guns gun sales according to the fbi who does background checks are up almost percent since january
vasectomies are up percent according to the cornell institute
and lastly but a very good point hopefully not related to the former point i just made which is that shark attacks are at their lowest level from
does anybody know why
no one is at the beach so there is a bright side to everything
but seriously what we see happening and the reason i want to stress that the consumer is not in retreat is that this is a tremendous opportunity for the consumer who drove us into this recession to lead us right back out
and what i mean by that is that we can move from mindless consumption to mindful consumption right
if you think about the last three decades the consumer has moved from savvy about marketing in the to gathering all these amazing social and search tools in this decade but the one thing that has been holding them back is the ability to discriminate
by restricting their demand consumers can actually align their values with their spending and drive capitalism and business to not just be about more but be about better
were going to explain that right now
based on y amp rs brandasset valuator proprietary tool of vml and young amp rubicam we set out to understand whats been happening in the crisis with the consumer marketplace
we found a couple of really interesting things
were going to go through four value shifts that we see driving new consumer behaviors that offer new management principles
the first cultural value shift that we see is this tendency toward something we call liquid life
this is the movement from americans defining their success on having things to having liquidity because the less excess that you have around you the more nimble and fleet of foot you are
as a result déclassé consumption is in
déclassé consumption is the whole idea that spending money frivolously makes you look a little bit anti fashion
the management principle is dollars and cents
so lets look at some examples of this déclassé consumption that falls out of this value
first things is we see something must be happening when p diddy vows to tone down his bling
but seriously we also have this phenomenon on madison avenue and in other places where people are actually walking out of luxury boutiques with ordinary sort of generic paper bags to hide the brand purchases
we see high end haggling in fashion today
high end haggling for luxury and real estate
we also see just a relaxing of ego and sort of a dismantling of artifice
this is a story on the yacht club thats all basically blue collar
blue collar yacht club where you can join the yacht club but youve got to work in the boat yard as sort of condition of membership
we also see the trend toward tourism thats a little bit more low key right
agritourism going to vineyards and going to farms
and then we also see this movement forward from dollars and cents
what businesses can do to connect with these new mindsets is really interesting
a couple things that are kind of cool
one is that frito lay figured out this liquidity thing with their consumer
they found their consumer had more money at the beginning of the month less at the end of the month so what they did is they started to change their packaging
larger packs at the beginning of the month smaller packaging at the end of the month
really interestingly too was the san francisco giants
theyve just instituted dynamic pricing
so it takes into account everything from the pitcher match ups to the weather to the team records in setting prices for the consumer
another quick example of these types of movements is the rise of zynga
zynga has risen on the consumers desire to not want to be locked in to fixed cost
again this theme is about variable cost variable living
so micropayments have become huge
and lastly some people are using hulu actually as a device to get rid of their cable bill
so really clever ideas there that are kind of being taken ahold and marketers are starting to understand
the second of the four values is this movement toward ethics and fair play
we see that play itself out with empathy and respect
the consumer is demanding it
and as a result businesses must provide not only value but values
increasingly consumers are looking at the culture of the company looking for their conduct in the marketplace
so what we see with empathy and respect lots of really hopeful things that have come out of this recession
and ill give you a few examples
one is the rise toward communities and neighborhoods and increased emphasis on your neighbors as your support system
also a wonderful byproduct of sort of a really lousy thing which has been unemployment is a rise in volunteerism thats been noted in our country
we also see the phenomenon some of you may have boomerang kids these are boomerang alumni where universities are actually reconnecting with alumni in helping them with jobs sharing skills and retraining
we also talked about character and professionalism
we had this miracle on the hudson in new york city you know in january and suddenly sully has become a key name on babycenter
so from a value and values standpoint what companies can do is connect in lots of different ways
microsoft is doing something wonderful
they are actually vowing to retrain two million americans with i t training using their existing infrastructure to do something good
also a really interesting company is gore tex
gore tex is all about personal accountability of their management and their employees to the point where they really kind of shun the idea of bosses
but they also talk about the fact that their executives all of their expense reports are put onto their company intranet for everyone to see
complete transparency
think twice before you have that bottle of wine
the third of the four laws of post crisis consumerism is about durable living
were seeing on our data that consumers are realizing this is a marathon not a sprint
they are digging in and theyre looking for ways to extract value out of every purchase that they make
witness the fact that americans are holding on to their cars longer than ever before years on average in march a record
we also see the fact that libraries have become a huge resource for america
did you know that percent of americans now carry a library card
the highest percentage ever in our nations history
so what you see in this trend is also the accumulation of knowledge
continuing education is up
everything is focused on betterment and training and development and moving forward
we also see a big diy movement
i was fascinated to learn that percent of all homes in america are actually built by owners
that includes cottages and the like but percent
so people are getting their hands dirty they are rolling up their sleeves
they want these skills
we see that with the phenomenon of raising backyard hens and chickens and ducks and when you work out the math they say it doesnt work but the principle is there that its about being sustainable and taking care of yourself
and then we look at the high line in new york city an excellent use of reimagining existing infrastructure for something good which is a brand new park in new york city
so what brands can do and companies is pay dividends to consumers be a brand that lasts offer transparency promise youre going to be there beyond todays sale
perfect example of that is patagonia
patagonias footprint chronicles basically goes through and tracks every product that they make and gives you social responsibility and helps you understand the ethics that are behind the product that they make
another great example is fidelity
rather than instant cash back rewards on your credit or debit purchases this is about rewards for your student education
or the interesting company sunrun
i love this company theyve created a consumer collective where they put solar panels on households and create a consumer based utility where the electricity that they generate is basically pumped back out into the marketplace
so its a consumer driven co op
so the fourth sort of post crisis consumerism that we see is this movement about return to the fold
its incredibly important right now
trust is not parceled out as we all know
its now about connecting to your communities connecting to your social networks
in my book i talked about the fact that percent of people trust what other people say about a brand or a company versus percent on advertising
so in that respect cooperative consumerism has really taken off
this is about consumers working together to get what they want out of the marketplace
lets look at a couple of quick examples
the artisanal movement is huge
everything about locally derived products and services supporting your local neighborhoods whether its cheeses wines and other products
also this rise of local currencies
realizing that its difficult to get loans in this environment youre doing business with people you trust in your local markets
so this rise of this sort of local currency is another really interesting phenomenon
and then they did a recent report i thought was fascinating
they actually started in certain communities in the united states start to publish peoples electricity usage
and what they found out is when that was available for public record the peoples electricity usage in those communities dropped
then we also look at the idea of cow pooling which is the whole phenomenon of consumers organizing together to buy meat from organic farms that they know is safe and controlled in the way that they want it to be controlled
and then there is this other really interesting movement thats happened in california which is about carrot mobs
the traditional thing would be to boycott right
have a stick well why not have a carrot
so these are consumers organizing pooling their resources to incentify companies to do good
and then we look at what companies can do
this is all the opportunity about being a community organizer
you have to realize that you cant fight and control this
you actually need to organize it
you need to harness it you need to give it meaning
and there is lots of really interesting examples here that we see
first is just the rise of the fact that zagats has actually moved out of and diversified from rating restaurants into actually rating healthcare
so what credentials does zagats have
well they have a lot because its their network of people right
so that becomes a very powerful force for them to make their brand more elastic
then you look at the phenomenon of kogi
this kogi doesnt exist its a moving truck right
its a moving truck through l a and the only way you can find it is through twitter
or you look at johnson amp johnsons momversations
a phenomenal blog thats been built up
where j amp j basically is tapping into the power of mommy bloggers allowing them to basically create a forum where they can communicate and they can connect
and its also become a very very valuable sort of advertising revenue for j amp j as well
this plus the fact that youve got phenomenal work from ceos from ford to zappos connecting on twitter creating an open environment allowing their employees to be part of the process rather than hidden behind walls
you see this rising force in sort of total transparency and openness that companies are starting to adopt all because the consumer is demanding it
so when we look at this and we step back what i believe is that the crisis that exists today is definitely real
its been tremendously powerful for consumers
but at the same time this is also a tremendous opportunity
and the chinese character for crisis is actually the same side of the same coin
crisis equals opportunity
what were seeing with consumers right now is the ability for them to actually lead us forward out of this recession
so we believe that values driven spending will force capitalism to be better
it will drive innovation
it will make longer lasting products it will create better more intuitive customer service
it will give us the opportunity to connect with companies that share the values that we share
so when we look back and step out at this and see the beginning of these trends that were seeing in our data we see a very hopeful picture for the future of america
thank you very much

title scott mccloud the visual magic of comics title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript in this unmissable look at the magic of comics scott mccloud bends the presentation format into a cartoon like experience where colorful diversions whiz through childhood fascinations and imagined futures that our eyes can hear and touch description
of the five senses vision is the one that i appreciate the most and its the one that i can least take for granted
i think this is partially due to my father who was blind
it was a fact that he didnt make much of a fuss about usually
one time in nova scotia when we went to see a total eclipse of the sun yeah same one as in the carly simon song which may or may not refer to james taylor warren beatty or mick jagger were not really sure
they handed out these dark plastic viewers that allowed us to look directly at the sun without damaging our eyes
but dad got really scared he didnt want us doing that
he wanted us instead to use these cheap cardboard viewers so that there was no chance at all that our eyes would be damaged
i thought this was a little strange at the time
what i didnt know at the time was that my father had actually been born with perfect eyesight
when he and his sister martha were just very little their mom took them out to see a total eclipse or actually a solar eclipse and not long after that both of them started losing their eyesight
decades later it turned out that the source of their blindness was most likely some sort of bacterial infection
as near as we can tell it had nothing whatsoever to do with that solar eclipse but by then my grandmother had already gone to her grave thinking it was her fault
so dad graduated harvard in married my mom and bought a house in lexington massachusetts where the first shots were fired against the british in although we didnt actually hit any of them until concord
he got a job working for raytheon designing guidance systems which was part of the route high tech axis in those days so the equivalent of silicone valley in the
dad wasnt a real militaristic kind of guy he just really felt bad that he wasnt able to fight in world war ii on account of his handicap although they did let him get through the several hour long army physical exam before they got to the very last test which was for vision
so dad started racking up all of these patents and gaining a reputation as a blind genius rocket scientist inventor
but to us he was just dad and our home life was pretty normal
as a kid i watched a lot of television and had lots of nerdy hobbies like mineralogy and microbiology and the space program and a little bit of politics
i played a lot of chess
but at the age of a friend of mine got me interested in comic books and i decided that was what i wanted to do for a living
so heres my dad hes a scientist hes an engineer and hes a military contractor
so he has four kids right
one grows up to become a computer scientist one grows up to join the navy one grows up to become an engineer and then theres me the comic book artist
which incidentally makes me the opposite of dean kamen because im a comic book artist son of an inventor and hes an inventor son of a comic book artist
right its true
the funny thing is dad had a lot of faith in me
he had faith in my abilities as a cartoonist even though he had no direct evidence that i was any good whatsoever everything he saw was just a blur
now this gives a real meaning to the term blind faith which doesnt have the same negative connotation for me that it does for other people
now faith in things which cannot be seen which cannot be proved is not the sort of faith that ive ever really related to all that much
i tend to like science where what we see and can ascertain are the foundation of what we know
but theres a middle ground too
a middle ground tread by people like poor old charles babbage and his steam driven computers that were never built
nobody really understood what it was that he had in mind except for ada lovelace and he went to his grave trying to pursue that dream
vannevar bush with his memex this idea of all of human knowledge at your fingertips he had this vision
and i think a lot of people in his day probably thought he was a bit of a kook
and yeah we can look back in retrospect and say yeah ha ha you know its all microfilm but thats thats not the point he understood the shape of the future
so did j c r licklider and his notions for computer human interaction
same thing he understood the shape of the future even though it was something that would only be implemented by people much later
or paul baran and his vision for packet switching
hardly anybody listened to him in his day
or even the people who actually pulled it off the people at bolt beranek and newman in boston who just would sketch out these structures of what would eventually become a worldwide network and sketching things on the back of napkins and on note papers and arguing over dinner at howard johnsons on route in lexington massachusetts just two miles from where i was studying the queens gambit deferred and listening to gladys knight amp the pips singing midnight train to georgia while in my dads big easy chair you know
so three types of vision right
vision based on what one cannot see the vision of that unseen and unknowable
the vision of that which has already been proven or can be ascertained
and this third kind of vision of something which can be which may be based on knowledge but is as yet unproven
now weve seen a lot of examples of people who are pursuing that sort of vision in science but i think its also true in the arts its true in politics its even true in personal endeavors
what it comes down to really is four basic principles learn from everyone follow no one watch for patterns and work like hell
i think these are the four principles that go into this
and its that third one especially where visions of the future begin to manifest themselves
whats interesting is that this particular way of looking at the world is i think only one of four different ways that manifest themselves in different fields of endeavor
in comics i know that it results in sort of a formalist attitude towards trying to understand how it works
then theres another more classical attitude which embraces beauty and craft
another one which believes in the pure transparency of content
and then another which emphasizes the authenticity of human experience and honesty and rawness
these are four very different ways of looking at the world i even gave them names
the classicist the animist and formalist and iconoclast
interestingly it seemed to correspond more or less to jungs four subdivisions of human thought
and they reflect a dichotomy of art and delight on left and the right tradition and revolution on the top and the bottom
and if you go on the diagonal you get content and form and then beauty and truth
and it probably applies just as much to music and to movies and to fine art which has nothing whatsoever to do with vision at all or for that matter nothing to do with our conference theme of inspired by nature except to the extent of the fable of the frog who gives the ride to the scorpion on his back to get across the river because the scorpion promises not to sting him but then the scorpion does sting him anyway and they both die but not before the frog asks him why and the scorpion says because its my nature in that sense yes
so so this was my nature the thing was i saw that the route that i took to discovering this focus in my work and who i was i saw it as just this road to discovery
actually it was just me embracing my nature which means that i didnt actually fall that far from the tree after all
so what does a scientific mind do in the arts
well i started making comics but i also started trying to understand them almost immediately
and one of the most important things about comics i discovered was that comics are a visual medium but they try to embrace all of the senses within it
so the different elements of comics like pictures and words and the different symbols and everything in between that comics presents are all funneled through the single conduit of vision
so you have things like resemblance where something which resembles the physical world can be abstracted in a couple of different directions abstracted from resemblance but still retaining the complete meaning or abstracted away from both resemblance and meaning towards the picture plan
put all these three together and you have a nice little map of the entire boundary of visual iconography which comics can embrace
and if you move to the right you also get language because thats abstracting even further from resemblance but still maintaining meaning
vision is called upon to represent sound and to understand the common properties of those two and their common heritage as well
also to try to represent the texture of sound to capture its essential character through visuals
and theres also a balance between the visible and the invisible in comics
comics is a kind of call and response in which the artist gives you something to see within the panels and then gives you something to imagine between the panels
also another sense which comics vision represents and thats time
sequence is a very important aspect of comics
comics presents a kind of temporal map
and this temporal map was something that energizes modern comics but i was wondering if perhaps it also energizes other sorts of forms and i found some in history
and you can see this same principle operating in these ancient versions of the same idea
whats happening is the art form is colliding with the given technology whether its paint on stone like the tomb of the scribe in ancient egypt or a bas relief sculpture rising up a stone column or a foot long embroidery or painted deerskin and tree bark running across accordion folded pages
whats interesting is once you hit print and this is from by the way all of the artifacts of modern comics start to present themselves rectilinear panel arrangements simple line drawings without tone and a left to right reading sequence
and within years you already start to see word balloons and captions and its really just a hop skip and a jump from here to here
so i wrote a book about this in but as i was finishing the book i had to do a little bit of typesetting and i was tired of going to my local copy shop to do it so i bought a computer
and it was just a little thing it wasnt good for much except text entry but my father had told me about moores law about moores law back in the and i knew what was coming
and so i kept my eyes peeled to see if the sort of changes that happened when we went from pre print comics to print comics would happen when we went beyond to post print comics
so one of the first things that were proposed was that we could mix the visuals of comics with the sound motion and interactivity of the cd roms that were being made in those days
this was even before the web
and one of the first things they did was they tried to take the comics page as is and transplant it to monitors which was a classic mcluhanesque mistake of appropriating the shape of the previous technology as the content of the new technology
and so what they would do is theyd have these comic pages that resemble print comics pages and they would introduce all this sound and motion
the problem was that if you go with this idea this basic idea that space equals time in comics what happens is that when you introduce sound and motion which are temporal phenomena that can only be represented through time then they break with that continuity of presentation
interactivity was another thing
there were hypertext comics
but the thing about hypertext is that everything in hypertext is either here not here or connected to here its profoundly non spatial
the distance from abraham lincoln to a lincoln penny the penny marshall to the marshall plan to plan to nine lives its all the same
and but in comics in comics every aspect of the work every element of the work has a spatial relationship to every other element at all times
so the question was was there any way to preserve that spatial relationship while still taking advantage of all of the things that digital had to offer us
and i found my personal answer for this in those ancient comics that i was showing you
each of them has a single unbroken reading line whether its going zigzag across the walls or spiraling up a column or just straight left to right or even going in a backwards zigzag across those accordion folded pages
the same thing is happening and that is that the basic idea that as you move through space you move through time is being carried out without any compromise but there were compromises when print hit
adjacent spaces were no longer adjacent moments so the basic idea of comics was being broken again and again and again and again
and i thought o k well if thats true is there any way when we go beyond todays print to somehow bring that back
now the monitor is just as limited as the page technically right
its a different shape but other than that its the same basic limitation
but thats only if you look at the monitor as a page but not if you look at the monitor as a window
and thats what i proposed that perhaps we could create these comics on an infinite canvas along the x axis and the y axis and staircases
we could do circular narratives that were literally circular
we could do a turn in a story that was literally a turn
parallel narratives could be literally parallel
x y and also z
so i had all these notions this was back in the late and other people in my business thought i was pretty crazy but a lot of people then went on and actually did it
im going to show you a couple now
this was an early collage comic by a fellow named jason lex
and notice whats going on here
what im searching for is a durable mutation thats what all of us are searching for
as media head into this new era we are looking for mutations that are durable that have some sort of staying power
now were taking this basic idea of presenting comics in a visual medium and then were carrying it through all the way from beginning to end
thats that entire comic you just saw is up on the screen right now
but even though were only experiencing it one piece at a time thats just where the technology is right now
as the technology evolves as you get full immersive displays and whatnot this sort of thing will only grow
it will adapt it will adapt to its environment its a durable mutation
heres another one ill show you this is by drew weing this is called pup contemplates the heat death of the universe
see whats going on here as we draw these stories on an infinite canvas is youre creating a more pure expression of what this medium is all about
well go by this a little quickly you get the idea
i just want to get to the last panel
there we go
just one more
talk about your infinite canvas
its by a guy named daniel merlin goodbrey in britain
why is this important
i think this is important because media all media provide us a window back into our world
now it could be that motion pictures and eventually virtual reality or something equivalent to it some sort of immersive display is going to provide us with our most efficient escape from the world that were in
thats why most people turn to storytelling is to escape
but media provides us with a window back into the world that we live in
and when media evolve so that the identity of the media becomes increasingly unique
because what youre looking at is youre looking at comics cubed youre looking at comics that are more comics like than theyve ever been before
when that happens you provide people with multiple ways of re entering the world through different windows and when you do that it allows them to triangulate the world that they live in and see its shape
and thats why i think this is important
one of many reasons but ive got to go now
thank you for having me

title alan siegel lets simplify legal jargon title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript tax forms credit agreements healthcare legislation theyre crammed with gobbledygook says alan siegel and incomprehensibly long he calls for a simple sensible redesign and plain english to make legal paperwork intelligible to the rest of us description
so basically we have public leaders public officials who are out of control they are writing bills that are unintelligible and out of these bills are going to come maybe pages of regulations total complexity which has a dramatically negative impact on our life
if youre a veteran coming back from iraq or vietnam you face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits if youre trying to get a small business loan you face a blizzard of paperwork
what are we going to do about it i define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity transparency and empathy building humanity into communications
ive been simplifying things for years
i come out of the advertising and design business
my focus is understanding you people and how you interact with the government to get your benefits how you interact with corporations to decide whom youre going to do business with and how you view brands
so very quickly when president obama said i dont see why we cant have a one page plain english consumer credit agreement
so i locked myself in a room figured out the content organized the document and wrote it in plain english
ive had this checked by the two top consumer credit lawyers in the country
this is a real thing
now i went one step further and said why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers and just have a paper document lets go online
and many people might need help in computation
working with the harvard business school youll see this example when you talk about minimum payment if you spent dollars for a meal the longer you take to pay out that loan you see over a period of time using the minimum payment its dollars and cents
how about that do you think your bank is going to show that to people
but its going to work its more effective than just computational aids
and what about terms like over the limit
perhaps a stealth thing
define it in context tell people what it means
when you put it in plain english you almost force the institution to give the people a way a default out of that and not put themselves at risk
plain english is about changing the content
and one of the things im most proud of is this agreement for ibm
its a grid its a calendar
at such and such a date ibm has responsibilities you have responsibilities
received very favorably by business
and there is some good news to report today
each year one in taxpayers receives a notice from the irs
there are million letters that go out
running through this typical letter that they had i ran it through my simplicity lab its pretty unintelligible
all the parts of the document in red are not intelligible
we looked at doing over letters that cover percent of their transactions in plain english
they have been tested in the laboratory
when i run it through my lab this heat mapping shows everything is intelligible
and the irs has introduced the program
there are a couple of things going on right now that i want to bring to your attention
there is a lot of discussion now about a consumer financial protection agency how to mandate simplicity
we see all this complexity
its incumbent upon us and this organization i believe to make clarity transparency and empathy a national priority
there is no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate
there is no way we should do business with companies that have agreements with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible
so how are we going to change the world
make clarity transparency and simplicity a national priority
i thank you

title jack horner building a dinosaur from a chicken title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript renowned paleontologist jack horner has spent his career trying to reconstruct a dinosaur hes found fossils with extraordinarily well preserved blood vessels and soft tissues but never intact dna so in a new approach hes taking living descendants of the dinosaur and genetically engineering them to reactivate ancestral traits including teeth tails and even hands to make a chickenosaurus description
when i was growing up in montana i had two dreams
i wanted to be a paleontologist a dinosaur paleontologist and i wanted to have a pet dinosaur
and so thats what ive been striving for all of my life
i was very fortunate early in my career
i was fortunate in finding things
i wasnt very good at reading things
in fact i dont read much of anything
i am extremely dyslexic and so reading is the hardest thing i do
but instead i go out and i find things
then i just pick things up
i basically practice for finding money on the street
and i wander about the hills and i have found a few things
and i have been fortunate enough to find things like the first eggs in the western hemisphere and the first baby dinosaurs in nests the first dinosaur embryos and massive accumulations of bones
and it happened to be at a time when people were just starting to begin to realize that dinosaurs werent the big stupid green reptiles that people had thought for so many years
people were starting to get an idea that dinosaurs were special
and so at that time i was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues
we were able to actually say that dinosaurs based on the evidence we had that dinosaurs built nests and lived in colonies and cared for their young brought food to their babies and traveled in gigantic herds
so it was pretty interesting stuff
i have gone on to find more things and discover that dinosaurs really were very social
we have found a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults
the appearance of them would have been different which it is in all social animals
in social groups of animals the juveniles always look different than the adults
the adults can recognize the juveniles the juveniles can recognize the adults
and so were making a better picture of what a dinosaur looks like
and they didnt just all chase jeeps around
but it is that social thing that i guess attracted michael crichton
and in his book he talked about the social animals
and then steven spielberg of course depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures
the theme of this story is building a dinosaur and so we come to that part of jurassic park
michael crichton really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life
you all know the story right
i mean i assume everyone here has seen jurassic park
if you want to make a dinosaur you go out you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap otherwise known as amber that has some blood sucking insects in it good ones and you get your insect and you drill into it and you suck out some dna because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days sucked dinosaur dna out
and you take your dna back to the laboratory and you clone it
and i guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg or something like that and then you wait and lo and behold out pops a little baby dinosaur
and everybodys happy about that
and theyre happy over and over again
they keep doing it they just keep making these things
and then then then and then
then the dinosaurs being social act out their socialness and they get together and they conspire
and of course thats what makes steven spielbergs movie conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around
so i assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it and you drilled into it and you got something out of that insect and you cloned it and you did it over and over and over again youd have a room full of mosquitos
and probably a whole bunch of trees as well
now if you want dinosaur dna i say go to the dinosaur
so thats what weve done
back in when the movie came out we actually had a grant from the national science foundation to attempt to extract dna from a dinosaur and we chose the dinosaur on the left a tyrannosaurus rex which was a very nice specimen
and one of my former doctoral students dr mary schweitzer actually had the background to do this sort of thing
and so she looked into the bone of this t rex one of the thigh bones and she actually found some very interesting structures in there
they found these red circular looking objects and they looked for all the world like red blood cells
and theyre in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone
and so she thought well what the heck
so she sampled some material out of it
now it wasnt dna she didnt find dna
but she did find heme which is the biological foundation of hemoglobin
and that was really cool
that was interesting
that was here we have million year old heme
well we tried and tried and we couldnt really get anything else out of it
so a few years went by and then we started the hell creek project
and the hell creek project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them
and out in eastern montana theres a lot of space a lot of badlands and not very many people and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff
and we did find a lot of stuff
we found a lot of tyrannosaurs but we found one special tyrannosaur and we called it b rex
and b rex was found under a thousand cubic yards of rock
it wasnt a very complete t rex and it wasnt a very big t rex but it was a very special b rex
and i and my colleagues cut into it and we were able to determine by looking at lines of arrested growth some lines in it that b rex had died at the age of
we dont really know how long dinosaurs lived because we havent found the oldest one yet
but this one died at the age of
we gave samples to mary schweitzer and she was actually able to determine that b rex was a female based on medullary tissue found on the inside of the bone
medullary tissue is the calcium build up the calcium storage basically when an animal is pregnant when a bird is pregnant
so here was the character that linked birds and dinosaurs
but mary went further
she took the bone and she dumped it into acid
now we all know that bones are fossilized and so if you dump it into acid there shouldnt be anything left
but there was something left
there were blood vessels left
there were flexible clear blood vessels
and so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur
it was extraordinary
but she also found osteocytes which are the cells that laid down the bones
and try and try we could not find dna but she did find evidence of proteins
but we thought maybe well we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground
we thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast
and so we built a laboratory in the back of an wheeler trailer and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples
and we did we got better material
the cells looked better
the vessels looked better
found the protein collagen
i mean it was wonderful stuff
but its not dinosaur dna
so we have discovered that dinosaur dna and all dna just breaks down too fast
were just not going to be able to do what they did in jurassic park
were not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on a dinosaur
but birds are dinosaurs
birds are living dinosaurs
we actually classify them as dinosaurs
we now call them non avian dinosaurs and avian dinosaurs
so the non avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct
avian dinosaurs are our modern birds
so we dont have to make a dinosaur because we already have them
i know youre as bad as the sixth graders
the sixth graders look at it and they say no
you can call it a dinosaur but look at the velociraptor the velociraptor is cool
the chicken is not
so this is our problem as you can imagine
the chicken is a dinosaur
i mean it really is
you cant argue with it because were the classifiers and weve classified it that way
but the sixth graders demand it
fix the chicken
so thats what im here to tell you about how we are going to fix a chicken
so we have a number of ways that we actually can fix the chicken
because evolution works we actually have some evolutionary tools
well call them biological modification tools
we have selection
and we know selection works
we started out with a wolf like creature and we ended up with a maltese
i mean thats thats definitely genetic modification
or any of the other funny looking little dogs
we also have transgenesis
transgenesis is really cool too
thats where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one
thats how people make glofish
you take a glow gene out of a coral or a jellyfish and you stick it in a zebrafish and puff they glow
and thats pretty cool
and they obviously make a lot of money off of them
and now theyre making glow rabbits and glow all sorts of things
i guess we could make a glow chicken
but i dont think thatll satisfy the sixth graders either
but theres another thing
theres what we call atavism activation
and atavism activation is basically an atavism is an ancestral characteristic
you heard that occasionally children are born with tails and its because its an ancestral characteristic
and so there are a number of atavisms that can happen
snakes are occasionally born with legs
and heres an example
this is a chicken with teeth
a fellow by the name of matthew harris at the university of wisconsin in madison actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene for teeth and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth in chickens
now thats a good characteristic
we can save that one
we know we can use that
we can make a chicken with teeth
thats getting closer
thats better than a glowing chicken
a friend of mine a colleague of mine dr hans larsson at mcgill university is actually looking at atavisms
and hes looking at them by looking at the embryo genesis of birds and actually looking at how they develop and hes interested in how birds actually lost their tail
hes also interested in the transformation of the arm the hand to the wing
hes looking for those genes as well
and i said well if you can find those i can just reverse them and make what i need to make for the sixth graders
and so he agreed
and so thats what were looking into
if you look at dinosaur hands a velociraptor has that cool looking hand with the claws on it
archaeopteryx which is a bird a primitive bird still has that very primitive hand
but as you can see the pigeon or a chicken or anything else another bird has kind of a weird looking hand because the hand is a wing
but the cool thing is that if you look in the embryo as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand
it has the three fingers the three digits
but a gene turns on that actually fuses those together
and so what were looking for is that gene
we want to stop that gene from turning on fusing those hands together so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three fingered hand like the archaeopteryx
and the same goes for the tails
birds have basically rudimentary tails
and so we know that in embryo as the animal is developing it actually has a relatively long tail
but a gene turns on and resorbs the tail gets rid of it
so thats the other gene were looking for
we want to stop that tail from resorbing
so what were trying to do really is take our chicken modify it and make the chickenosaurus
its a cooler looking chicken
but its just the very basics
so that really is what were doing
and people always say why do that
why make this thing
what good is it
well thats a good question
actually i think its a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things
and quite frankly i think if colonel sanders was to be careful how he worded it he could actually advertise an extra piece
anyway when our dino chicken hatches it will be obviously the poster child or what you might call a poster chick for technology entertainment and design

title marco tempest a magical tale title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript marco tempest spins a beautiful story of what magic is how it entertains us and how it highlights our humanity all while working extraordinary illusions with his hands and an augmented reality machine description
marco tempest what id like to show you today is something in the way of an experiment
todays its debut
its a demonstration of augmented reality
and the visuals youre about to see are not prerecorded
they are live and reacting to me in real time
i like to think of it as a kind of technological magic
so fingers crossed
and keep your eyes on the big screen
augmented reality is the melding of the real world with computer generated imagery
it seems the perfect medium to investigate magic and ask why in a technological age we continue to have this magical sense of wonder
magic is deception but it is a deception we enjoy
to enjoy being deceived an audience must first suspend its disbelief
it was the poet samuel taylor coleridge who first suggested this receptive state of mind
samuel taylor coleridge i try to convey a semblance of truth in my writing to produce for these shadows of the imagination a willing suspension of disbelief that for a moment constitutes poetic faith
mt this faith in the fictional is essential for any kind of theatrical experience
without it a script is just words
augmented reality is just the latest technology
and sleight of hand is just an artful demonstration of dexterity
we are all very good at suspending our disbelief
we do it every day while reading novels watching television or going to the movies
we willingly enter fictional worlds where we cheer our heroes and cry for friends we never had
without this ability there is no magic
it was jean robert houdin frances greatest illusionist who first recognized the role of the magician as a storyteller
he said something that ive posted on the wall of my studio
jean robert houdin a conjurer is not a juggler
he is an actor playing the part of a magician
mt which means magic is theater and every trick is a story
the tricks of magic follow the archetypes of narrative fiction
there are tales of creation and loss death and resurrection and obstacles that must be overcome
now many of them are intensely dramatic
magicians play with fire and steel defy the fury of the buzzsaw dare to catch a bullet or attempt a deadly escape
but audiences dont come to see the magician die they come to see him live
because the best stories always have a happy ending
the tricks of magic have one special element
they are stories with a twist
now edward de bono argued that our brains are pattern matching machines
he said that magicians deliberately exploit the way their audiences think
edward de bono stage magic relies almost wholly on the momentum error
the audience is led to make assumptions or elaborations that are perfectly reasonable but do not in fact match what is being done in front of them
mt in that respect magic tricks are like jokes
jokes lead us down a path to an expected destination
but when the scenario we have imagined suddenly flips into something entirely unexpected we laugh
the same thing happens when people watch magic tricks
the finale defies logic gives new insight into the problem and audiences express their amazement with laughter
its fun to be fooled
one of the key qualities of all stories is that theyre made to be shared
we feel compelled to tell them
when i do a trick at a party that person will immediately pull their friend over and ask me to do it again
they want to share the experience
that makes my job more difficult because if i want to surprise them i need to tell a story that starts the same but ends differently a trick with a twist on a twist
it keeps me busy
now experts believe that stories go beyond our capacity for keeping us entertained
we think in narrative structures
we connect events and emotions and instinctively transform them into a sequence that can be easily understood
its a uniquely human achievement
we all want to share our stories whether it is the trick we saw at the party the bad day at the office or the beautiful sunset we saw on vacation
today thanks to technology we can share those stories as never before by email facebook blogs tweets on ted com

title chip kidd designing books is no laughing matter ok it is title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript chip kidd doesn t judge books by their cover he creates covers that embody the book and he does it with a wicked sense of humor in one of the funniest talks from he shows the art and deep thought of his cover designs this talk is from the design studio session at guest curated by chee pearlman and david rockwell description
hi
i did that for two reasons
first of all i wanted to give you a good visual first impression
but the main reason i did it is that thats what happens to me when im forced to wear a lady gaga skanky mic
im used to a stationary mic
its the sensible shoe of public address
but you clamp this thing on my head and something happens
i just become skanky
so im sorry about that
and im already off message
ladies and gentlemen i have devoted the past years of my life to designing books
yes books you know the bound volumes with ink on paper
you cannot turn them off with a switch
tell your kids it all sort of started as a benign mistake like penicillin
what i really wanted was to be a graphic designer at one of the big design firms in new york city
but upon arrival there in the fall of and doing a lot of interviews i found that the only thing i was offered was to be assistant to the art director at alfred a knopf a book publisher
now i was stupid but not so stupid that i turned it down
i had absolutely no idea what i was about to become part of and i was incredibly lucky
soon it had occurred to me what my job was
my job was to ask this question what do the stories look like
because that is what knopf is
it is the story factory one of the very best in the world
we bring stories to the public
the stories can be anything and some of them are actually true
but they all have one thing in common they all need to look like something
they all need a face
why to give you a first impression of what you are about to get into
a book designer gives form to content but also manages a very careful balance between the two
now the first day of my graphic design training at penn state university the teacher lanny sommese came into the room and he drew a picture of an apple on the blackboard and wrote the word apple underneath and he said ok lesson one listen up
and he covered up the picture and he said you either say this and then he covered up the word or you show this
but you dont do this
because this is treating your audience like a moron
and they deserve better
and lo and behold soon enough i was able to put this theory to the test on two books that i was working on for knopf
the first was katharine hepburns memoirs and the second was a biography of marlene dietrich
now the hepburn book was written in a very conversational style it was like she was sitting across a table telling it all to you
the dietrich book was an observation by her daughter it was a biography
so the hepburn story is words and the dietrich story is pictures and so we did this
so there you are
pure content and pure form side by side
no fighting ladies
now what is the story here
someone is re engineering dinosaurs by extracting their dna from prehistoric amber
genius
now luckily for me i live and work in new york city where there are plenty of dinosaurs
so i went to the museum of natural history and i checked out the bones and i went to the gift shop and i bought a book
and i was particularly taken with this page of the book and more specifically the lower right hand corner
now i took this diagram and i put it in a photostat machine and i took a piece of tracing paper and i taped it over the photostat with a piece of scotch tape stop me if im going too fast and then i took a rapidograph pen explain it to the youngsters and i just started to reconstitute the dinosaur
i had no idea what i was doing i had no idea where i was going but at some point i stopped when to keep going would seem like i was going too far
and what i ended up with was a graphic representation of us seeing this animal coming into being
were in the middle of the process
and then i just threw some typography on it
very basic stuff slightly suggestive of public park signage
everybody in house loved it and so off it goes to the author
and even back then michael was on the cutting edge
that was a relief to see that pour out of the machine
i miss michael
and sure enough somebody from mca universal calls our legal department to see if they can maybe look into buying the rights to the image just in case they might want to use it
well they used it
and i was thrilled
we all know it was an amazing movie and it was so interesting to see it go out into the culture and become this phenomenon and to see all the different permutations of it
but not too long ago i came upon this on the web
no that is not me
but whoever it is i cant help but thinking they woke up one day like oh my god that wasnt there last night ooooohh
i was so wasted
but if you think about it from my head to my hands to his leg
thats a responsibility
and its a responsibility that i dont take lightly
the book designers responsibility is threefold to the reader to the publisher and most of all to the author
i want you to look at the authors book and say wow i need to read that
david sedaris is one of my favorite writers and the title essay in this collection is about his trip to a nudist colony
and the reason he went is because he had a fear of his body image and he wanted to explore what was underlying that
for me it was simply an excuse to design a book that you could literally take the pants off of
but when you do you dont get what you expect
you get something that goes much deeper than that
and david especially loved this design because at book signings which he does a lot of he could take a magic marker and do this
hello
augusten burroughs wrote a memoir called and its about his time in rehab
in his he was a hotshot ad executive and as mad men has told us a raging alcoholic
he did not think so however but his coworkers did an intervention and they said you are going to rehab or you will be fired and you will die
now to me this was always going to be a typographic solution what i would call the opposite of type
what does that mean
usually on the first day of introduction to typography you get the assignment of select a word and make it look like what it says it is so thats type right
very simple stuff
this is going to be the opposite of that
i want this book to look like its lying to you desperately and hopelessly the way an alcoholic would
the answer was the most low tech thing you can imagine
i set up the type i printed it out on an epson printer with water soluble ink taped it to the wall and threw a bucket of water at it presto
then when we went to press the printer put a spot gloss on the ink and it really looked like it was running
not long after it came out augusten was waylaid in an airport and he was hiding out in the bookstore spying on who was buying his books
and this woman came up to it and she squinted and she took it to the register and she said to the man behind the counter this ones ruined
and the guy behind the counter said i know lady they all came in that way
now thats a good printing job
a book cover is a distillation
it is a haiku if you will of the story
this particular story by osama tezuka is his epic life of the buddha and its eight volumes in all but the best thing is when its on your shelf you get a shelf life of the buddha moving from one age to the next
all of these solutions derive their origins from the text of the book but once the book designer has read the text then he has to be an interpreter and a translator
this story was a real puzzle
this is what its about
all right so i got a collection of the paintings together and i looked at them and i deconstructed them and i put them back together
and so heres the design right
and so heres the front and the spine and its flat
but the real story starts when you wrap it around a book and put it on the shelf
ahh we come upon them the clandestine lovers lets draw them out
huhh theyve been discovered by the sultan
he will not be pleased
huhh and now the sultan is in danger
and now we have to open it up to find out whats going to happen next
try experiencing that on a kindle
dont get me started
seriously
much is to be gained by ebooks ease convenience portability
but something is definitely lost tradition a sensual experience the comfort of thingy ness a little bit of humanity
do you know what john updike used to do the first thing when he would get a copy of one of his new books from alfred a knopf
hed smell it
then hed run his hand over the rag paper and the pungent ink and the deckled edges of the pages
all those years all those books he never got tired of it
now i am all for the ipad but trust me smelling it will get you nowhere
now the apple guys are texting develop odor emission plug in
and the last story im going to talk about is quite a story
a woman named aomame in japan finds herself negotiating down a spiral staircase off an elevated highway when she gets to the bottom she cant help but feel that all of a sudden shes entered a new reality thats just slightly different from the one that she left but very similar but different
and so were talking about parallel planes of existence sort of like a book jacket and the book that it covers
so how do we show this
we go back to hepburn and dietrich but now we merge them
so were talking about different planes different pieces of paper
so this is on a semi transparent piece of velum
its one part of the form and content
when its on top of the paper board which is the opposite it forms this
so even if you dont know anything about this book you are forced to consider a single person straddling two planes of existence
and the object itself invited exploration interaction consideration and touch
this debuted at number two on the new york times best seller list
this is unheard of both for us the publisher and the author
were talking a page book that is as weird as it is compelling and featuring a climactic scene in which a horde of tiny people emerge from the mouth of a sleeping girl and cause a german shepherd to explode
not exactly jackie collins
fourteen weeks on the best seller list eight printings and still going strong
so even though we love publishing as an art we very much know its a business too and that if we do our jobs right and get a little lucky that great art can be great business
so thats my story to be continued
what does it look like
yes it can it does and it will but for this book designer page turner dog eared place holder notes in the margins taker ink sniffer the story looks like this
thank you

title aicha el wafi phyllis rodriguez the mothers who found forgiveness friendship title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript phyllis rodriguez and aicha el wafi have a powerful friendship born of unthinkable loss rodriguez son was killed in the world trade center attacks on september el wafis son zacarias moussaoui was convicted of a role in those attacks and is serving a life sentence in hoping to find peace these two moms have come to understand and respect one another description
phyllis rodriguez we are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship
and it is
and yet it feels natural to us now
i first learned that my son had been in the world trade center on the morning of september
we didnt know if he had perished yet until hours later
at the time we knew that it was political
we were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of our son my husband orlando and i and our family
and when i saw it and yet through the shock the terrible shock and the terrible explosion in our lives literally we were not vengeful
and a couple of weeks later when zacarias moussaoui was indicted on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism and the u s government called for a death penalty for him if convicted my husband and i spoke out in opposition to that publicly
through that and through human rights groups we were brought together with several other victims families
when i saw aicha in the media coming over when her son was indicted and i thought what a brave woman
someday i want to meet that woman when im stronger
i was still in deep grief i knew i didnt have the strength
i knew i would find her someday or we would find each other
because when people heard that my son was a victim i got immediate sympathy
but when people learned what her son was accused of she didnt get that sympathy
but her suffering is equal to mine
so we met in november and aicha will now tell you how that came about
aicha el wafi good afternoon ladies and gentlemen
i am the mother of zacarias moussaoui
and i asked the organization of human rights to put me in touch with the parents of the victims
so they introduced me to five families
and i saw phyllis and i watched her
she was the only mother in the group
the others were brothers sisters
and i saw in her eyes that she was a mother just like me
i suffered a lot as a mother
i was married when i was
i lost a child when i was a second child when i was
so the story with zacarias was too much really
and i still suffer because my son is like hes buried alive
i know she really cried for her son
but she knows where he is
my son i dont know where he is
i dont know if hes alive i dont know if hes tortured
i dont know what happened to him
so thats why i decided to tell my story so that my suffering is something positive for other women
for all the women all the mothers that give life you can give back you can change
its up to us women because we are women because we love our children
we must be hand in hand and do something together
its not against women its for us for us women for our children
i talk against violence against terrorism
i go to schools to talk to young muslim girls so they dont accept to be married against their will very young
so if i can save one of the young girls and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as i did well this is something good
this is why im here in front of you
pr i would like to say that i have learned so much from aicha starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members which was a very private meeting with security because it was november and frankly we were afraid of the super patriotism of that time in the country those of us family members
but we were all so nervous
why does she want to meet us
and then she was nervous
why did we want to meet her
what did we want from each other
before we knew each others names or anything we had embraced and wept
then we sat in a circle with support with help from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation
and aicha started and she said i dont know if my son is guilty or innocent but i want to tell you how sorry i am for what happened to your families
i know what it is to suffer and i feel that if there is a crime a person should be tried fairly and punished
but she reached out to us in that way and it was id like to say it was an ice breaker
and what happened then is we all told our stories and we all connected as human beings
by the end of the afternoon it was about three hours after lunch wed felt as if wed known each other forever
now what i learned from her is a woman not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then and what was being done to her son but the life shes had
i never had met someone with such a hard life from such a totally different culture and environment from my own
and i feel that we have a special connection which i value very much
and i think its all about being afraid of the other but making that step and then realizing hey this wasnt so hard
who else can i meet that i dont know or that im so different from
so aicha do you have a couple of words for conclusion
because our time is up
aw i wanted to say that we have to try to know other people the other
you have to be generous and your hearts must be generous your mind must be generous
you must be tolerant
you have to fight against violence
and i hope that someday well all live together in peace and respecting each other
this is what i wanted to say

title graham hill why im a weekday vegetarian title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript we all know the arguments that being vegetarian is better for the environment and for the animals but in a carnivorous culture it can be hard to make the change graham hill has a powerful pragmatic suggestion be a weekday veg description
about a year ago i asked myself a question knowing what i know why am i not a vegetarian
after all im one of the green guys i grew up with hippie parents in a log cabin
i started a site called treehugger i care about this stuff
i knew that eating a mere hamburger a day can increase my risk of dying by a third
cruelty i knew that the billion animals we raise each year for meat are raised in factory farm conditions that we hypocritically wouldnt even consider for our own cats dogs and other pets
environmentally meat amazingly causes more emissions than all of transportation combined cars trains planes buses boats all of it
and beef production uses times the water that most vegetables do
i also knew that im not alone
we as a society are eating twice as much meat as we did in the
so what was once the special little side treat now is the main much more regular
so really any of these angles should have been enough to convince me to go vegetarian
yet there i was chk chk chk tucking into a big old steak
so why was i stalling
i realized that what i was being pitched was a binary solution
it was either youre a meat eater or youre a vegetarian and i guess i just wasnt quite ready
imagine your last hamburger
so my common sense my good intentions were in conflict with my taste buds
and id commit to doing it later and not surprisingly later never came
sound familiar
so i wondered might there be a third solution
and i thought about it and i came up with one
ive been doing it for the last year and its great
its called weekday veg
the name says it all nothing with a face monday through friday
on the weekend your choice
simple
if you want to take it to the next level remember the major culprits in terms of environmental damage and health are red and processed meats
so you want to swap those out with some good sustainably harvested fish
its structured so it ends up being simple to remember and its okay to break it here and there
after all cutting five days a week is cutting percent of your meat intake
the program has been great weekday veg
my footprints smaller im lessening pollution i feel better about the animals im even saving money
best of all im healthier i know that im going to live longer and ive even lost a little weight
so please ask yourselves for your health for your pocketbook for the environment for the animals whats stopping you from giving weekday veg a shot
after all if all of us ate half as much meat it would be like half of us were vegetarians
thank you

title jonathan eisen meet your microbes title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript our bodies are covered in a sea of microbes both the pathogens that make us sick and the good microbes about which we know less that might be keeping us healthy at tedmed microbiologist jonathan eisen shares what we know including some surprising ways to put those good microbes to work description
im going to start with a little story
so i grew up in this neighborhood when i was years old i went from being what i think was a strapping young athlete over four months slowly wasting away until i was basically a famine victim with an unquenchable thirst
i had basically digested away my body
and this all came to a head when i was on a backpacking trip my first one ever actually on old rag mountain in west virginia and was putting my face into puddles of water and drinking like a dog
that night i was taken into the emergency room and diagnosed as a type diabetic in full blown ketoacidosis
and i recovered thanks to the miracles of modern medicine insulin and other things and gained all my weight back and more
and something festered inside me after this happened
what i thought about was what caused the diabetes
you see diabetes is an autoimmune disease where your body fights itself and at the time people thought that somehow maybe exposure to a pathogen had triggered my immune system to fight the pathogen and then kill the cells that make insulin
and this is what i thought for a long period of time and thats in fact what medicine and people have focused on quite a bit the microbes that do bad things
and thats where i need my assistant here now
you may recognize her
so i went yesterday i apologize i skipped a few of the talks and i went over to the national academy of sciences building and they sell toys giant microbes
and here we go
so you have caught flesh eating disease if you caught that one
i gotta get back out my baseball ability here
so unfortunately or not surprisingly most of the microbes they sell at the national academy building are pathogens
everybody focuses on the things that kill us and thats what i was focusing on
and it turns out that we are covered in a cloud of microbes and those microbes actually do us good much of the time rather than killing us
and so weve known about this for some period of time
people have used microscopes to look at the microbes that cover us i know youre not paying attention to me but
the microbes that cover us
and if you look at them in the microscope you can see that we actually have times as many cells of microbes on us as we have human cells
theres more mass in the microbes than the mass of our brain
we are literally a teeming ecosystem of microorganisms
and unfortunately if you want to learn about the microorganisms just looking at them in a microscope is not sufficient
and so we just heard about the dna sequencing
it turns out that one of the best ways to look at microbes and to understand them is to look at their dna
and thats what ive been doing for years using dna sequencing collecting samples from various places including the human body reading the dna sequence and then using that dna sequencing to tell us about the microbes that are in a particular place
and whats amazing when you use this technology for example looking at humans were not just covered in a sea of microbes
there are thousands upon thousands of different kinds of microbes on us
we have millions of genes of microbes in our human microbiome covering us
and so this microbial diversity differs between people and what people have been thinking about in the last maybe years is maybe these microbes this microbial cloud in and on us and the variation between us may be responsible for some of the health and illness differences between us
and that comes back to the diabetes story i was telling you
it turns out that people now think that one of the triggers for type diabetes is not fighting a pathogen but is in fact trying to miscommunicating with the microbes that live in and on you
and somehow maybe the microbial community thats in and on me got off and then this triggered some sort of immune response and led to me killing the cells that make insulin in my body
and so what i want to tell you about for a few minutes is what people have learned using dna sequencing techniques in particular to study the microbial cloud that lives in and on us
and i want to tell you a story about a personal project
my first personal experience with studying the microbes on the human body actually came from a talk that i gave right around the corner from here at georgetown
i gave a talk and a family friend who happened to be the dean of georgetown medical school was at the talk and came up to me afterwards saying they were doing a study of ileal transplants in people
and they wanted to look at the microbes after the transplants
and so i started a collaboration with this person michael zasloff and thomas fishbein to look at the microbes that colonized these ilea after they were transplanted into a recipient
and i can tell you all the details about the microbial study that we did there but the reason i want to tell you this story is something really striking that they did at the beginning of this project
they take the donor ileum which is filled with microbes from a donor and they have a recipient who might have a problem with their microbial community say crohns disease and they sterilized the donor ileum
cleaned out all the microbes and then put it in the recipient
they did this because this was common practice in medicine even though it was obvious that this was not a good idea
and fortunately in the course of this project the transplant surgeons and the other people decided forget common practice we have to switch
so they actually switched to leaving some of the microbial community in the ileum they leave the microbes with the donor and theoretically that might help the people who are receiving this ileal transplant
and so people this is a study that i did now
in the last few years theres been a great expansion in using dna technology to study the microbes in and on people
theres something called the human microbiome project thats going on in the united states and metahit going on in europe and a lot of other projects
and when people have done a variety of studies they have learned things such as when a baby is born during vaginal delivery you get colonized by the microbes from your mother
there are risk factors associated with cesarean sections some of those risk factors may be due to mis colonization when you carve a baby out of its mother rather than being delivered through the birth canal
and a variety of other studies have shown that the microbial community that lives in and on us helps in development of the immune system helps in fighting off pathogens helps in our metabolism and determining our metabolic rate probably determines our odor and may even shape our behavior in a variety of ways
and so these studies have documented or suggested out of a variety of important functions for the microbial community this cloud the non pathogens that live in and on us
and one area that i think is very interesting which many of you may have now that weve thrown microbes into the crowd is something that i would call germophobia
so people are really into cleanliness right
we have antibiotics in our kitchen counters people are washing every part of them all of the time we pump antibiotics into our food into our communities we take antibiotics excessively
and killing pathogens is a good thing if youre sick but we should understand that when we pump chemicals and antibiotics into our world that were also killing the cloud of microbes that live in and on us
and excessive use of antibiotics in particular in children has been shown to be associated with again risk factors for obesity for autoimmune diseases for a variety of problems that are probably due to disruption of the microbial community
so the microbial community can go wrong whether we want it to or not or we can kill it with antibiotics but what can we do to restore it
im sure many people here have heard about probiotics
probiotics are one thing that you can try and do to restore the microbial community that is in and on you
and they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases
theres a project going on at uc davis where people are using probiotics to try and treat prevent necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants
premature infants have real problems with their microbial community
and it may be that probiotics can help prevent the development of this horrible necrotizing enterocolitis in these premature infants
but probiotics are sort of a very very simple solution
most of the pills that you can take or the yogurts that you can eat have one or two species in them maybe five species in them and the human community is thousands upon thousands of species
so what can we do to restore our microbial community when we have thousands and thousands of species on us
well one thing that animals seem to do is they eat poo coprophagia
and it turns out that many veterinarians old school veterinarians in particular have been doing something called poo tea not booty but poo tea to treat colic and other ailments in horses and cows and things like that where you make tea from the poo from a healthy individual animal and you feed it to a sick animal
although unless you have a fistulated cow with a big hole in its side and you can put your hand into its rumen its hard to imagine that the delivery of microbes directly into the mouth and through the entire top of the digestive tract is the best delivery system so you may have heard in people they are now doing fecal transplants where rather than delivering a couple of probiotic microbes through the mouth they are delivering a community of probiotics a community of microbes from a healthy donor through the other end
and this has turned out to be very effective in fighting certain intransigent infectious diseases like clostridium difficile infections that can stay with people for years and years and years
transplants of the feces of the microbes from the feces from a healthy donor has actually been shown to cure systemic c dif infections in some people
now what these transplants these fecal transplants or the poo tea suggest to me and many other people have come up with this same idea is that the microbial community in and on us its an organ
we should view it as a functioning organ part of ourselves
we should treat it carefully and with respect and we do not want to mess with it say by c sections or by antibiotics or excessive cleanliness without some real good justification
and what the dna sequencing technologies are allowing people to do now is do detailed studies of say patients who have crohns disease and people who dont have crohns disease
or people who took antibiotics when they were little and people who did not take antibiotics
and we can now start to compare the community of microbes and their genes and see if there are differences
and eventually we may be able to understand if theyre not just correlative differences but causative
studies in model systems like mouse and other animals are also helping do this but people are now using these technologies because theyve gotten very cheap to study the microbes in and on a variety of people
so in wrapping up what i want to tell you about is i didnt tell you a part of the story of coming down with diabetes
it turns out that my father was an m d actually studied hormones i told him many times that i was tired thirsty not feeling very good
and he shrugged it off i think he either thought i was just complaining a lot or it was the typical m d nothing can be wrong with my children
we even went to the international society of endocrinology meeting as family in quebec
and i was getting up every five minutes to pee and drinking everybodys water at the table and i think they all thought i was a druggie
but the reason im telling you this is that the medical community my father as an example sometimes doesnt see whats right in front of their eyes
the microbial cloud it is right in front of us
we cant see it most of the time its invisible
theyre microbes theyre tiny
but we can see them through their dna we can see them through the effects that they have on people
and what we need now is to start thinking about this microbial community in the context of everything in human medicine
it doesnt mean that it affects every part of us but it might
what we need is a full field guide to the microbes that live in and on people so that we can understand what theyre doing to our lives
we are them they are us

title tierney thys swim with the giant sunfish title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript marine biologist tierney thys asks us to step into the water to visit the world of the mola mola or giant ocean sunfish basking eating jellyfish and getting massages this behemoth offers clues to life in the open sea description
id like to start tonight by something completely different asking you to join me by stepping off the land and jumping into the open ocean for a moment
percent of the living space on the planet is in the open ocean and its where life the title of our seminar tonight its where life began
and its a lively and a lovely place but were rapidly changing the oceans with our not only with our overfishing our irresponsible fishing our adding of pollutants like fertilizer from our cropland but also most recently with climate change and steve schneider im sure will be going into greater detail on this
now as we continue to tinker with the oceans more and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that were creating will be conducive to low energy type of animals like jellyfish and bacteria
and this might be the kind of seas were headed for
now jellyfish are strangely hypnotic and beautiful and youll see lots of gorgeous ones at the aquarium on friday but they sting like hell and jellyfish sushi and sashimi is just not going to fill you up
about grams of jellyfish equals four calories
so it may be good for the waistline but it probably wont keep you satiated for very long
and a sea thats just filled and teeming with jellyfish isnt very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans that is unless you eat jellyfish
and this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack on this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there a by the wind sailor
and that predator is the giant ocean sunfish the mola mola whose primary prey are jellyfish
this animal is in the guinness world book of records for being the worlds heaviest bony fish
it reaches up to almost pounds on a diet of jellyfish primarily
and i think its kind of a nice little cosmological convergence here that the mola mola its common name is sunfish that its favorite food is the moon jelly
so its kind of nice the sun and the moon getting together this way even if one is eating the other
now this is typically how you see sunfish this is where they get their common name
they like to sunbathe cant blame them
they just lay out on the surface of the sea and most people think theyre sick or lazy but thats a typical behavior they lie out and bask on the surface
their other name mola mola is it sounds hawaiian but its actually latin for millstone and thats attributable to their roundish very bizarre cut off shape
its as if as they were growing they just forgot the tail part
and thats actually what drew me to the mola in the first place was this terribly bizarre shape
you know you look at sharks and theyre streamlined and theyre sleek and you look at tuna and theyre like torpedoes they just give away their agenda theyre about migration and strength and then you look at the sunfish
and this is just so elegantly mysterious its just it really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say a tuna
so i was just intrigued with what you know what is this animals story
well as with anything in biology nothing really makes sense except in the light of evolution
the molas no exception
they appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared million years ago at a time when whales still had legs and they come from a rebellious little puffer fish faction oblige me a little kipling esque storytelling here
of course evolution is somewhat random and you know about million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction that said oh the heck with the coral reefs were going to head to the high seas
and lots of generations lots of tweaking and torquing and we turn our puffer into the mola
you know if you give mother nature enough time that is what she will produce
they look maybe they look kind of prehistoric and unfinished abridged perhaps but in fact in fact they are the they vie for the top position of the most evolutionarily derived fish in the sea right up there with flat fish
theyre every single thing about that fish has been changed
and in terms of fishes fishes appeared million years ago and theyre pretty modern just million years ago so so interestingly they give away their ancestry as they develop
they start as little eggs and theyre in the guinness world book of records again for having the most number of eggs of any vertebrate on the planet
a single four foot female had million eggs can carry million eggs in her ovaries imagine and they get to be over feet long imagine what a foot one has
and from that little egg they pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage reminiscent of their ancestry and develop this is their little adolescent stage
they school as adolescents and become behemoth loners as adults
thats a little diver up there in the corner
theyre in the guinness world book of records again for being the vertebrate growth champion of the world
from their little hatching size of their egg into their little larval stage till they reach adulthood they put on million times an increase in weight
million now imagine if you gave birth to a little baby and you had to feed this thing
that would mean that your child you would expect it to gain the weight of six titanics
now i dont know how youd feed a child like that but we dont know how fast the molas grow in the wild but captive growth studies at the monterey bay aquarium one of the first places to have them in captivity they had one that gained lbs in months
i said now thats a true american
so being a loner is a great thing especially in todays seas because schooling used to be salvation for fishes but its suicide for fishes now
but unfortunately molas even though they dont school they still get caught in nets as by catch
if were going to save the world from total jellyfish domination then weve got to figure out what the jellyfish predators how they live their lives like the mola
and unfortunately they make up a large portion of the california by catch up to percent of the drift net
and in the mediterranean in the swordfish net fisheries they make up up to percent
so weve got to figure out how theyre living their lives
and how do you do that
how do you do that with an animal very few places in the world
this is an open ocean creature it knows no boundaries it doesnt go to land
how do you get insight
how do you seduce an open ocean creature like that to spill its secrets
well theres some great new technology that has just recently become available and its just a boon for getting insight into open ocean animals
and its pictured right here that little tag up there
that little tag can record temperature depth and light intensity which is correlated with time and from that we can get locations
and it can record this data for up to two years and keep it in that tag release at a pre programmed time float to the surface upload all that data that whole travelogue to satellite which relays it directly to our computers and weve got that whole dataset and we didnt even have we just had to tag the animal and then we went home and you know sat at our desks
so the great thing about the mola is that when we put the tag on them if you look up here thats streaming off thats right where we put the tag
and it just so happens thats a parasite hanging off the mola
molas are infamous for carrying tons of parasites
theyre just parasite hotels even their parasites have parasites
i think donne wrote a poem about that
but they have genera of parasites and so we figured just one more parasite wont be too much of a problem
and they happen to be a very good vehicle for carrying oceanographic equipment
they dont seem to mind so far
so what are we trying to find out were focusing on the pacific
were tagging on the california coast and were tagging over in taiwan and japan
and were interested in how these animals are using the currents using temperature using the open ocean to live their lives
wed love to tag in monterey
monterey is one of the few places in the world where molas come in large numbers
not this time of year its more around october
and wed love to tag here this is an aerial shot of monterey but unfortunately the molas here end up looking like this because another one of our locals really likes molas but in the wrong way
the california sea lion takes the molas as soon as they come into the bay rips off their fins fashions them into the ultimate frisbee mola style and then tosses them back and forth
and im not exaggerating it is just and sometimes they dont eat them its just spiteful
and you know the locals think its terrible behavior its just horrible watching this happen day after day
the poor little molas coming in getting ripped to shreds so we head down south to san diego
not so many california sea lions down there
and the molas there you can find them with a spotter plane very easily and they like to hang out under floating rafts of kelp
and under those kelps this is why the molas come there because its spa time for the molas there
as soon as they get under those rafts of kelp the exfoliating cleaner fish come
and they come and give the molas you can see they strike this funny little position that says im not threatening but i need a massage
and theyll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head and the fish come up and they just clean clean clean because the molas you know theres just a smorgasbord of parasites
and its also a great place to go down south because the waters warmer and the molas are kind of friendly down there
i mean what other kind of fish if you approach it right will say okay scratch me right there
you truly can swim up to a mola theyre very gentle and if you approach them right you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it
so weve also tagged one part of the pacific weve gone over to another part of the pacific and weve tagged in taiwan and we tagged in japan
and over in these places the molas are caught in set nets that line these countries
and theyre not thrown back as by catch theyre eaten
we were served a nine course meal of mola after we tagged
well not the one we tagged
and everything from the kidney to the testes to the back bone to the fin muscle to i think that ís pretty much the whole fish is eaten
so the hardest part of tagging now is after you put that tag on you have to wait months
and youre just wondering oh i hope the fish is safe i hope i hope its going to be able to actually live its life out during the course that the tag is recording
the tags cost dollars each and then satellite time is another dollars so youre like oh i hope the tag is okay
and so the waiting is really the hardest part
im going to show you our latest dataset
and it hasnt been published so its totally privy information just for ted
and in showing you this you know when were looking at this data were thinking oh do these animals do they cross the equator
do they go from one side of the pacific to the other
and we found that they kind of are homebodies
theyre not big migrators this is their track we deployed the tag off of tokyo and the mola in one month kind of got into the kuroshio current off of japan and foraged there
and after four months went up you know off of the north part of japan
and thats kind of their home range
now thats important though because if theres a lot of fishing pressure that population doesnt get replenished
so thats a very important piece of data
but also whats important is that theyre not slacker lazy fish
theyre super industrious
and this is a day in the life of a mola and if we theyre up and down and up and down and up and down and up and up and down up to times a day
as the sun comes up you see in the blue they start their dive
down and as the sun gets brighter they go a little deeper little deeper
they plumb the depths down to meters in temperatures to one degree centigrade and this is why you see them on the surface its so cold down there
theyve got to come up warm get that solar power and then plunge back into the depths and go up and down and up and down
and theyre hitting a layer down there its called the deep scattering layer which a whole variety of foods in that layer
so rather than just being some sunbathing slacker theyre really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance between the surface and the bottom and through temperature
we see the same pattern now with these tags were seeing a similar pattern for swordfishes manta rays tunas a real three dimensional play
this is part of a much larger program called the census of marine life where theyre going to be tagging all over the world and the molas going to enter into that
and whats exciting you all travel and you know the best thing about traveling is to be able to find the locals and to find the great places by getting the local knowledge
well now with the census of marine life well be able to sidle up to all the locals and explore percent of our living space with local knowledge
its never its really never been a more exciting or a vital time to be a biologist
which brings me to my last point and what i think is kind of the most fun
i set up a website because i was getting so many questions about molas and sunfish
and so i just figured id have the questions answered and id be able to thank my funders like national geographic and lindbergh
but people would write into the site with all sorts of all sorts of stories about these animals and wanting to help me get samples for genetic analysis
and what i found most exciting is that everyone had a shared a shared love and an interest in the oceans
i was getting reports from catholic nuns jewish rabbis muslims christians everybody writing in united by their love of life
and to me that i dont think i could say it any better than the immortal bard himself one touch of nature makes the whole world kin
and sure it may be just one big old silly fish but its helping
if its helping to unite the world i think its definitely the fish of the future

title taryn simon photographs of secret sites title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript taryn simon exhibits her startling take on photography to reveal worlds and people we would never see otherwise she shares two projects one documents otherworldly locations typically kept secret from the public the other involves haunting portraits of men convicted for crimes they did not commit description
okay so percent of my photographic process is in fact not photographic
it involves a campaign of letter writing research and phone calls to access my subjects which can range from hamas leaders in gaza to a hibernating black bear in its cave in west virginia
and oddly the most notable letter of rejection i ever received came from walt disney world a seemingly innocuous site
and it read im just going to read a key sentence especially during these violent times i personally believe that the magical spell cast upon guests who visit our theme parks is particularly important to protect and helps to provide them with an important fantasy they can escape to
photography threatens fantasy
they didnt want to let my camera in because it confronts constructed realities myths and beliefs and provides what appears to be evidence of a truth
but there are multiple truths attached to every image depending on the creators intention the viewer and the context in which it is presented
over a five year period following september when the american media and government were seeking hidden and unknown sites beyond its borders most notably weapons of mass destruction i chose to look inward at that which was integral to americas foundation mythology and daily functioning
i wanted to confront the boundaries of the citizen self imposed and real and confront the divide between privileged and public access to knowledge
it was a critical moment in american history and global history where one felt they didnt have access to accurate information
and i wanted to see the center with my own eyes but what i came away with is a photograph
and its just another place from which to observe and the understanding that there are no absolute all knowing insiders
and the outsider can never really reach the core
im going to run through some of the photographs in this series
its titled an american index of the hidden and unfamiliar and its comprised of nearly images
in this context ill just show you a few
this is a nuclear waste storage and encapsulation facility at hanford site in washington state where there are over stainless steel capsules containing nuclear waste submerged in water
a human standing in front of an unprotected capsule would die instantly
and i found one section amongst all of these that actually resembled the outline of the united states of america which you can see here
and a big part of the work that is sort of absent in this context is text
so i create these two poles
every image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text
and what im most interested in is the invisible space between a text and its accompanying image and how the image is transformed by the text and the text by the image
so at best the image is meant to float away into abstraction and multiple truths and fantasy
and then the text functions as this cruel anchor that kind of nails it to the ground
but in this context im just going to read an abridged version of those texts
this is a cryopreservation unit and it holds the bodies of the wife and mother of cryonics pioneer robert ettinger who hoped to be awoken one day to extended life in good health with advancements in science and technology all for the cost of thousand dollars for forever
this is a year old palestinian woman undergoing hymenoplasty
hymenoplasty is a surgical procedure which restores the virginal state allowing her to adhere to certain cultural expectations regarding virginity and marriage
so it essentially reconstructs a ruptured hymen allowing her to bleed upon having sexual intercourse to simulate the loss of virginity
this is a jury simulation deliberation room and you can see beyond that two way mirror jury advisers standing in a room behind the mirror
and they observe deliberations after mock trial proceedings so that they can better advise their clients how to adjust their trial strategy to have the outcome that theyre hoping for
this process costs dollars
this is a u s customs and border protection room a contraband room at john f kennedy international airport
on that table you can see hours worth of seized goods from passengers entering in to the united states
there is a pigs head and african cane rats
and part of my photographic work is im not just documenting whats there
i do take certain liberties and intervene
and in this i really wanted it to resemble an early still life painting so i spent some time with the smells and items
this is the exhibited art on the walls of the cia in langley virginia their original headquarters building
and the cia has had a long history with both covert and public cultural diplomacy efforts
and its speculated that some of their interest in the arts was designed to counter soviet communism and promote what it considered to be pro american thoughts and aesthetics
and one of the art forms that elicited the interest of the agency and had thus come under question is abstract expressionism
this is the forensic anthropology research facility and on a six acre plot there are approximately cadavers at any given time that are being studied by forensic anthropologists and researchers who are interested in monitoring a rate of corpse decomposition
and in this particular photograph the body of a young boy has been used to reenact a crime scene
this is the only federally funded site where it is legal to cultivate cannabis for scientific research in the united states
its a research crop marijuana grow room
and part of the work that i hope for is that there is a sort of disorienting entropy where you cant find any discernible formula in how these things they sort of awkwardly jump from government to science to religion to security and you cant completely understand how information is being distributed
these are transatlantic submarine communication cables that travel across the floor of the atlantic ocean connecting north america to europe
they carry over million simultaneous voice conversations and in a lot of the government and technology sites there was just this very apparent vulnerability
this one is almost humorous because it feels like i could just snip all of that conversation in one easy cut
but stuff did feel like it could have been taken or years ago like it was locked in the cold war era and hadnt necessarily progressed
this is a braille edition of playboy magazine
and this is a division of the library of congress produces a free national library service for the blind and visually impaired and the publications they choose to publish are based on reader popularity
and playboy is always in the top few
but youd be surprised they dont do the photographs its just the text
this is an avian quarantine facility where all imported birds coming into america are required to undergo a day quarantine where they are tested for diseases including exotic newcastle disease and avian influenza
this film shows the testing of a new explosive fill on a warhead
and the air armament center at eglin air force base in florida is responsible for the deployment and testing of all air delivered weaponry coming from the united states
and the film was shot on millimeter government issue film
and that red dot is a marking on the government issue film
all living white tigers in north america are the result of selective inbreeding that would be mother to son father to daughter sister to brother to allow for the genetic conditions that create a salable white tiger
meaning white fur ice blue eyes a pink nose
and the majority of these white tigers are not born in a salable state and are killed at birth
its a very violent process that is little known
and the white tiger is obviously celebrated in several forms of entertainment
kenny was born he actually made it to adulthood
he has since passed away but was mentally retarded and suffers from severe bone abnormalities
this on a lighter note is at george lucas personal archive
this is the death star
and its shown here in its true orientation
in the context of star wars return of the jedi its mirror image is presented
they flip the negative
and you can see the photoetched brass detailing and the painted acrylic facade
in the context of the film this is a deep space battle station of the galactic empire capable of annihilating planets and civilizations and in reality it measures about four feet by two feet
this is at fort campbell in kentucky
its a military operations on urbanized terrain site
essentially theyve simulated a city for urban combat and this is one of the structures that exists in that city
its called the world church of god
its supposed to be a generic site of worship
and after i took this photograph they constructed a wall around the world church of god to mimic the set up of mosques in afghanistan or iraq
and i worked with mehta vihar who creates virtual simulations for the army for tactical practice
and we put that wall around the world church of god and also used the characters and vehicles and explosions that are offered in the video games for the army
and i put them into my photograph
this is live hiv virus at harvard medical school who is working with the u s government to develop sterilizing immunity
and alhurra is a u s government sponsored arabic language television network that distributes news and information to over countries in the arab world
it runs hours a day commercial free
however its illegal to broadcast alhurra within the united states
and in they developed a channel called alhurra iraq which specifically deals with events occurring in iraq and is broadcast to iraq
now im going to move on to another project i did
its titled the innocents
and for the men in these photographs photography had been used to create a fantasy
contradicting its function as evidence of a truth in these instances it furthered the fabrication of a lie
i traveled across the united states photographing men and women who had been wrongfully convicted of crimes they did not commit violent crimes
i investigate photographys ability to blur truth and fiction and its influence on memory which can lead to severe even lethal consequences
for the men in these photographs the primary cause of their wrongful conviction was mistaken identification
a victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcements use of images
but through exposure to composite sketches polaroids mug shots and line ups eyewitness testimony can change
ill give you an example from a case
a woman was raped and presented with a series of photographs from which to identify her attacker
she saw some similarities in one of the photographs but couldnt quite make a positive identification
days later she is presented with another photo array of all new photographs except that one photograph that she had some draw to from the earlier array is repeated in the second array
and a positive identification is made because the photograph replaced the memory if there ever was an actual memory
photography offered the criminal justice system a tool that transformed innocent citizens into criminals and the criminal justice system failed to recognize the limitations of relying on photographic identifications
frederick daye who is photographed at his alibi location where witnesses placed him at the time of the crime
he was convicted by an all white jury of rape kidnapping and vehicle theft
and he served years of a life sentence
now dna exonerated frederick and it also implicated another man who was serving time in prison
but the victim refused to press charges because she claimed that law enforcement had permanently altered her memory through the use of fredericks photograph
charles fain was convicted of kidnapping rape and murder of a young girl walking to school
he served years of a death sentence
i photographed him at the scene of the crime at the snake river in idaho
and i photographed all of the wrongfully convicted at sites that came to particular significance in the history of their wrongful conviction
the scene of arrest the scene of misidentification the alibi location
and here the scene of the crime its this place to which hes never been but changed his life forever
so photographing there i was hoping to highlight the tenuous relationship between truth and fiction in both his life and in photography
calvin washington was convicted of capital murder
he served years of a life sentence in waco texas
larry mayes i photographed at the scene of arrest where he hid between two mattresses in gary indiana in this very room to hide from the police
he ended up serving and a half years of an year sentence for rape and robbery
the victim failed to identify larry in two live lineups and then made a positive identification days later from a photo array
larry youngblood served eight years of a and half year sentence in arizona for the abduction and repeated sodomizing of a year old boy at a carnival
he is photographed at his alibi location
ron williamson ron was convicted of the rape and murder of a barmaid at a club and served years of a death sentence
i photographed ron at a baseball field because he had been drafted to the oakland as to play professional baseball just before his conviction
and the states key witness in rons case was in the end the actual perpetrator
ronald jones served eight years of a death sentence for rape and murder of a year old woman
i photographed him at the scene of arrest in chicago
william gregory was convicted of rape and burglary
he served seven years of a year sentence in kentucky
timothy durham who i photographed at his alibi location where witnesses placed him at the time of the crime was convicted of years of a year sentence for several charges of rape and robbery
he had been misidentified by an year old victim
troy webb is photographed here at the scene of the crime in virginia
he was convicted of rape kidnapping and robbery and served seven years of a year sentence
troys picture was in a photo array that the victim tentatively had some draw toward but said he looked too old
the police went and found a photograph of troy webb from four years earlier which they entered into a photo array days later and he was positively identified
now im going to leave you with a self portrait
and it reiterates that distortion is a constant and our eyes are easily deceived
thats it thank you

think about your day for a second
you woke up felt fresh air on your face as you walked out the door encountered new colleagues and had great discussions and felt in awe when you found something new
but i bet theres something you didnt think about today something so close to home that you probably dont think about it very often at all
and thats that all the sensations feelings decisions and actions are mediated by the computer in your head called the brain
now the brain may not look like much from the outside a couple pounds of pinkish gray flesh amorphous but the last hundred years of neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain and to see the intricacy of what lies within
and theyve told us that this brain is an incredibly complicated circuit made out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons
now unlike a human designed computer where theres a fairly small number of different parts we know how they work because we humans designed them the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cells maybe tens of thousands
they come in different shapes theyre made out of different molecules
and they project and connect to different brain regions and they also change different ways in different disease states
lets make it concrete
theres a class of cells a fairly small cell an inhibitory cell that quiets its neighbors
its one of the cells that seems to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia
its called the basket cell
and this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about
new ones are being discovered everyday
as just a second example these pyramidal cells large cells they can span a significant fraction of the brain
theyre excitatory
and these are some of the cells that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy
every one of these cells is an incredible electrical device
they receive input from thousands of upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs which then if they pass a certain threshold will go to thousands of downstream partners
and this process which takes just a millisecond or so happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your billion cells as long as you live and think and feel
so how are we going to figure out what this circuit does
ideally we could go through the circuit and turn these different kinds of cell on and off and see whether we could figure out which ones contribute to certain functions and which ones go wrong in certain pathologies
if we could activate cells we could see what powers they can unleash what they can initiate and sustain
if we could turn them off then we could try and figure out what theyre necessary for
and thats a story im going to tell you about today
and honestly where weve gone through over the last years through an attempt to find ways of turning circuits and cells and parts and pathways of the brain on and off both to understand the science and also to confront some of the issues that face us all as humans
now before i tell you about the technology the bad news is that a significant fraction of us in this room if we live long enough will encounter perhaps a brain disorder
already a billion people have had some kind of brain disorder that incapacitates them and the numbers dont do it justice though
these disorders schizophrenia alzheimers depression addiction they not only steal our time to live they change who we are
they take our identity and change our emotions and change who we are as people
now in the century there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders practically none of them can be considered to be cured
and part of thats because were bathing the brain in the chemical
this elaborate circuit made out of thousands of different kinds of cell is being bathed in a substance
thats also why perhaps most of the drugs and not all on the market can present some kind of serious side effect too
now some people have gotten some solace from electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain
and for parkinsons disease cochlear implants these have indeed been able to bring some kind of remedy to people with certain kinds of disorder
but electricity also will go in all directions the path of least resistance which is where that phrase in part comes from
and it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix
so again were sent back to the idea of ultra precise control
could we dial in information precisely where we want it to go
so when i started in neuroscience years ago i had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist and the first thing i thought about was if these neurons are electrical devices all we need to do is to find some way of driving those electrical changes at a distance
if we could turn on the electricity in one cell but not its neighbors that would give us the tool we need to activate and shut down these different cells figure out what they do and how they contribute to the networks in which theyre embedded
and also it would allow us to have the ultra precise control we need in order to fix the circuit computations that have gone awry
now how are we going to do that
well there are many molecules that exist in nature which are able to convert light into electricity
you can think of them as little proteins that are like solar cells
if we can install these molecules in neurons somehow then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light
and their neighbors which dont have the molecule would not
theres one other magic trick you need to make this all happen and thats the ability to get light into the brain
and to do that the brain doesnt feel pain you can put taking advantage of all the effort thats gone into the internet and communications and so on optical fibers connected to lasers that you can use to activate in animal models for example in pre clinical studies these neurons and to see what they do
so how do we do this
around in collaboration with gerhard nagel and karl deisseroth this vision came to fruition
theres a certain alga that swims in the wild and it needs to navigate towards light in order to photosynthesize optimally
and it senses light with a little eye spot which works not unlike how our eye works
in its membrane or its boundary it contains little proteins that indeed can convert light into electricity
so these molecules are called channelrhodopsins
and each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that i told you about
when blue light hits it it opens up a little hole and allows charged particles to enter the eye spot and that allows this eye spot to have an electrical signal just like a solar cell charging up a battery
so what we need to do is to take these molecules and somehow install them in neurons
and because its a protein its encoded for in the dna of this organism
so all weve got to do is take that dna put it into a gene therapy vector like a virus and put it into neurons
so it turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy and lots of viruses were coming along
so this turned out to be very simple to do
and early in the morning one day in the summer of we gave it a try and it worked on the first try
you take this dna and you put it into a neuron
the neuron uses its natural protein making machinery to fabricate these little light sensitive proteins and install them all over the cell like putting solar panels on a roof you have a neuron which can be activated with light
so this is very powerful
one of the tricks you have to do is to figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells that you want and not all the other neighbors
and you can do that you can tweak the viruses so they hit just some cells and not others
and theres other genetic tricks you can play in order to get light activated cells
this field has now come to be known as optogenetics
and just as one example of the kind of thing you can do you can take a complex network use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense network
and then when you shine light on the entire network just that cell type will be activated
so for example lets sort of consider that basket cell i told you about earlier the one thats atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory
if we can deliver that gene to these cells and theyre not going to be altered by the expression of the gene of course and then flash blue light over the entire brain network just these cells are going to be driven
and when the light turns off these cells go back to normal so they dont seem to be averse against that
not only can you use this to study what these cells do what their power is in computing in the brain but you can also use this to try to figure out well maybe we could jazz up the activity of these cells if indeed theyre atrophied
now i want to tell you a couple of short stories about how were using this both at the scientific clinical and pre clinical levels
one of the questions weve confronted is what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward
because if you could find those those would be some of the signals that could drive learning
the brain will do more of whatever got that reward
and also these are signals that go awry in disorders such as addiction
so if we could figure out what cells they are we could maybe find new targets for which drugs could be designed or screened against or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have very severe disability
so to do that we came up with a very simple paradigm in collaboration with the fiorella group where one side of this little box if the animal goes there the animal gets a pulse of light in order to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light
so if these cells can mediate reward the animal should go there more and more
and so thats what happens
this animals going to go to the right hand side and poke his nose there and he gets a flash of blue light every time he does that
and hell do that hundreds and hundreds of times
these are the dopamine neurons which some of you may have heard about in some of the pleasure centers in the brain
now weve shown that a brief activation of these is enough indeed to drive learning
now we can generalize the idea
instead of one point in the brain we can devise devices that span the brain that can deliver light into three dimensional patterns arrays of optical fibers each coupled to its own independent miniature light source
and then we can try to do things in vivo that have only been done to date in a dish like high throughput screening throughout the entire brain for the signals that can cause certain things to happen
or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders
and one story i want to tell you about is how can we find targets for treating post traumatic stress disorder a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear
and one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear
this goes back to the pavlovian days
its called pavlovian fear conditioning where a tone ends with a brief shock
the shock isnt painful but its a little annoying
and over time in this case a mouse which is a good animal model commonly used in such experiments the animal learns to fear the tone
the animal will react by freezing sort of like a deer in the headlights
now the question is what targets in the brain can we find that allow us to overcome this fear
so what we do is we play that tone again after its been associated with fear
but we activate targets in the brain different ones using that optical fiber array i told you about in the previous slide in order to try and figure out which targets can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear
and so this brief video shows you one of these targets that were working on now
this is an area in the prefrontal cortex a region where we can use cognition to try to overcome aversive emotional states
and the animals going to hear a tone and a flash of light occurred there
theres no audio on this but you can see the animals freezing
this tone used to mean bad news
and theres a little clock in the lower left hand corner so you can see the animal is about two minutes into this
and now this next clip is just eight minutes later
and the same tone is going to play and the light is going to flash again
okay there it goes right now
and now you can see just minutes into the experiment that weve equipped the brain by photoactivating this area to overcome the expression of this fear memory
now over the last couple of years weve gone back to the tree of life because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off
if we could do that this could be extremely powerful
if you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds or seconds you can figure out what necessary role they play in the circuits in which theyre embedded
and weve now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life every kingdom of life except for animals we see slightly differently
and we found all sorts of molecules theyre called halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins that respond to green and yellow light
and they do the opposite thing of the molecule i told you about before with the blue light activator channelrhodopsin
lets give an example of where we think this is going to go
consider for example a condition like epilepsy where the brain is overactive
now if drugs fail in epileptic treatment one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain
but thats obviously irreversible and there could be side effects
what if we could just turn off that brain for a brief amount of time until the seizure dies away and cause the brain to be restored to its initial state sort of like a dynamical system thats being coaxed down into a stable state
so this animation just tries to explain this concept where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light and we beam light in and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure were hoping to be able to turn it off
and so we dont have data to show you on this front but were very excited about this
now i want to close on one story which we think is another possibility which is that maybe these molecules if you can do ultra precise control can be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic an optical prosthetic
i already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon
seventy five thousand people have parkinsons deep brain stimulators implanted
maybe people have cochlear implants which allow them to hear
theres another thing which is youve got to get these genes into cells
and new hope in gene therapy has been developed because viruses like the adeno associated virus which probably most of us around this room have and it doesnt have any symptoms which have been used in hundreds of patients to deliver genes into the brain or the body
and so far there have not been serious adverse events associated with the virus
theres one last elephant in the room the proteins themselves which come from algae and bacteria and fungi and all over the tree of life
most of us dont have fungi or algae in our brains so what is our brain going to do if we put that in
are the cells going to tolerate it will the immune system react
in its early days these have not been done on humans yet but were working on a variety of studies to try and examine this and so far we havent seen overt reactions of any severity to these molecules or to the illumination of the brain with light
so its early days to be upfront but were excited about it
i wanted to close with one story which we think could potentially be a clinical application
now there are many forms of blindness where the photoreceptors our light sensors that are in the back of our eye are gone
and the retina of course is a complex structure
now lets zoom in on it here so we can see it in more detail
the photoreceptor cells are shown here at the top and then the signals that are detected by the photoreceptors are transformed by various computations until finally that layer of cells at the bottom the ganglion cells relay the information to the brain where we see that as perception
in many forms of blindness like retinitis pigmentosa or macular degeneration the photoreceptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed
now how could you repair this
its not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored because theres nothing for the drug to bind to
on the other hand light can still get into the eye
the eye is still transparent and you can get light in
so what if we could just take these channelrhodopsins and other molecules and install them on some of these other spare cells and convert them into little cameras
and because theres so many of these cells in the eye potentially they could be very high resolution cameras
so this is some work that were doing
its being led by one of our collaborators alan horsager at usc and being sought to be commercialized by a start up company eos neuroscience which is funded by the nih
and what you see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze
its a six arm maze and theres a bit of water in the maze to motivate the mouse to move or hell just sit there
and the goal of course of this maze is to get out of the water and go to a little platform thats under the lit top port
now mice are smart so this mouse solves the maze eventually but he does a brute force search
hes swimming down every avenue until he finally gets to the platform
so hes not using vision to do it
these different mice are different mutations that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that affect humans
and so were being careful in trying to look at these different models so we come up with a generalized approach
so how are we going to solve this
were going to do exactly what we outlined in the previous slide
were going to take these blue light photosensors and install them on a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light sensitive
light is converted to electricity on them
so this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment and received one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus
and now you can see the animal can indeed avoid walls and go to this little platform and make cognitive use of its eyes again
and to point out the power of this these animals are able to get to that platform just as fast as animals that have seen their entire lives
so this pre clinical study i think bodes hope for the kinds of things were hoping to do in the future
to close i want to point out that were also exploring new business models for this new field of neurotechnology
were developing these tools but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world so people can study and try to treat different disorders
and our hope is that by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them we can take some of these intractable disorders that i told you about earlier practically none of which are cured and in the century make them history
thank you
juan enriquez so some of the stuff is a little dense
but the implications of being able to control seizures or epilepsy with light instead of drugs and being able to target those specifically is a first step
the second thing that i think i heard you say is you can now control the brain in two colors like an on off switch
ed boyden thats right
je which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code
eb right yeah
so with blue light we can drive information and its in the form of a one
and by turning things off its more or less a zero
so our hope is to eventually build brain coprocessors that work with the brain so we can augment functions in people with disabilities
je and in theory that means that as a mouse feels smells hears touches you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros
eb sure yeah were hoping to use this as a way of testing what neural codes can drive certain behaviors and certain thoughts and certain feelings and use that to understand more about the brain
je does that mean that some day you could download memories and maybe upload them
eb well thats something were starting to work on very hard
were now working on some work where were trying to tile the brain with recording elements too
so we can record information and then drive information back in sort of computing what the brain needs in order to augment its information processing
je well that might change a couple things thank you

title ueli gegenschatz extreme wingsuit flying title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript wingsuit jumping is the leading edge of extreme sports an exhilarating feat of almost unbelievable daring where skydivers soar through canyons at over ueli gegenschatz talks about how he does it and shows jawdropping film description
i started with paragliding
paragliding is taking off from mountains with a paraglider with the possibility to fly cross country distance just with the use of thermals to soar
also different aerobatic maneuvers are possible with a paraglider
from there i started with skydiving
in this picture you can see there is a four way skydive four people flying together and on the left hand side its the camera flier with the camera mounted to his helmet so he can film the whole jump for the film itself and also for the judging
from regular relative skydiving i went on to freeflying
freeflying is more the three dimensional skydiving
you can see the skydiver with the red suit hes in a stand up position
the one with the yellow green suit hes flying head down
and thats me in the background carving around the whole formation in freefall also with the helmet cam to film this jump
from freeflying i went on to skysurfing
skysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet
you can imagine with this big surface of a skysurfing board there is a lot of force a lot of power
of course i can use this power for example for nice spinning we call it helicopter moves
from there i went on to wingsuit flying
wingsuit flying is a suit that i can make fly just only with my body
if i put some tension on my body tension on my suit i can make it fly and as you see the fall rate is much much slower because of the bigger surface
with a proper body position im able to really move forward to gain quite some distance
this is a jump i did in rio de janeiro
you can see the copacabana on the left hand side
from there with all the skills and knowledge from paragliding and all the different disciplines in skydiving i went on to base jumping
base jumping is skydiving from fixed objects like buildings antennae bridges and earth meaning mountains cliffs
its for sure for me its the ultimate feeling of being in free fall with all the visual references
so my goal soon was to discover new places that nobody had jumped before
so in summer i was the first to base jump the eiger north face in switzerland
two years after this i was the first to base jump from matterhorn a very famous mountain that probably everybody knows in here
i did a base jump from the eiger from the monk and from the jungfrau three very famous mountains in switzerland
the special thing on these three jumps were i hiked them all and climbed them all in only one day
in i jumped the eiffel tower in paris
so with all this knowledge i also wanted to get into stunts
so with some friends we started to do different tricks like for example this jump here i jumped from a paraglider
or here everybody was freezing pretty much except me because it was very cold in austria where we did this filming
everybody sitting in a basket and i was on top of the balloon ready to slide down with my skysurf board
or this jump from a moving truck on the highway
extreme sports on top level like this is only possible if you practice step by step if you really work hard on your skills and on your knowledge
of course you need to be in physical very good condition so im training a lot
you need to have the best possible equipment
and probably the most important is you have to work on your mental skills mental preparation
and all this to come as close as possible to the human dream of being able to fly
so for im training hard for my two new projects
the first one i want to set a world record in flying from a cliff with my wingsuit
and i want to set a new record with the longest distance ever flown
for my second project i have a sensational idea of a jump that never has been done before
so now on the following movie you will see that im much better in flying a wingsuit than speaking in english
enjoy and thank you very much
june cohen i have some questions
i think we all might have some questions
question one so does that actually feel the way the flying dream does
because it looks like it might
ueli gegenschatz pretty much i believe this is probably the closest possibility to come to the dream of being able to fly
jc i know the answer to this but how do you land
ue parachute we have to open a parachute just seconds before i would say impact
its not possible to land a wingsuit yet
jc yet but people are trying are you among those youre not going to commit are you among those trying to do it
ue its a dream its a dream yeah
were still working on it and were developing the wingsuits to get better performance to get more knowledge
and i believe soon
jc all right well we will watch this space but i have two more questions
what is the there was exhaust coming out of the back of the wingsuit was that a propelled wingsuit that you were wearing
ue nope its just smoke
jc coming off of you
ue hopefully not
jc that seems dangerous
ue no smoke is for two reasons you can see the speed you can see the way where i was flying
thats reason number one and reason number two its much easier for the camera guy to film if im using smoke
jc ah i see so the wingsuit is set up to deliberately release smoke so that you can be tracked one more question
what do you do to to cover your face
because i just keep thinking of going that fast and having your whole face smushed backwards
are you in a helmet are you in goggles
ue the purest and the best feeling would be with only goggles
jc and is that how you usually fly
ue usually im wearing a helmet in the mountains im always wearing a helmet because of landings usually its difficult its not like regular skydiving where you have like the big landings
so you have to be prepared
jc right now is there anything you dont do
do people come to you with projects and say we want you to do this
and do you ever say no no im not going to
ue oh of course of course some people have crazy ideas and jc a round of applause
ue thank you very much

title mikko hypponen how the nsa betrayed the worlds trust time to act title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript recent events have highlighted underlined and bolded the fact that the united states is performing blanket surveillance on any foreigner whose data passes through an american entity whether they are suspected of wrongdoing or not this means that essentially every international user of the internet is being watched says mikko hypponen an important rant wrapped with a plea to find alternative solutions to using american companies for the worlds information needs description
the two most likely largest inventions of our generation are the internet and the mobile phone
theyve changed the world
however largely to our surprise they also turned out to be the perfect tools for the surveillance state
it turned out that the capability to collect data information and connections about basically any of us and all of us is exactly what weve been hearing throughout of the summer through revelations and leaks about western intelligence agencies mostly u s intelligence agencies watching over the rest of the world
weve heard about these starting with the revelations from june
edward snowden started leaking information top secret classified information from the u s intelligence agencies and we started learning about things like prism and xkeyscore and others
and these are examples of the kinds of programs u s intelligence agencies are running right now against the whole rest of the world
and if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by george orwell well it turns out that george orwell was an optimist
we are right now seeing a much larger scale of tracking of individual citizens than he could have ever imagined
and this here is the infamous nsa data center in utah
due to be opened very soon it will be both a supercomputing center and a data storage center
you could basically imagine it has a large hall filled with hard drives storing data they are collecting
and its a pretty big building
how big well i can give you the numbers square meters but that doesnt really tell you very much
maybe its better to imagine it as a comparison
you think about the largest ikea store youve ever been in
this is five times larger
how many hard drives can you fit in an ikea store
right its pretty big
we estimate that just the electricity bill for running this data center is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year
and this kind of wholesale surveillance means that they can collect our data and keep it basically forever keep it for extended periods of time keep it for years keep it for decades
and this opens up completely new kinds of risks to us all
and what this is is that it is wholesale blanket surveillance on everyone
well not exactly everyone because the u s intelligence only has a legal right to monitor foreigners
they can monitor foreigners when foreigners data connections end up in the united states or pass through the united states
and monitoring foreigners doesnt sound too bad until you realize that im a foreigner and youre a foreigner
in fact percent of the planet are foreigners
right
so it is wholesale blanket surveillance of all of us all of us who use telecommunications and the internet
but dont get me wrong there are actually types of surveillance that are okay
i love freedom but even i agree that some surveillance is fine
if the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer or theyre trying to catch a drug lord or trying to prevent a school shooting and they have leads and they have suspects then its perfectly fine for them to tap the suspects phone and to intercept his internet communications
im not arguing that at all but thats not what programs like prism are about
they are not about doing surveillance on people that they have reason to suspect of some wrongdoings
theyre about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent
so the four main arguments supporting surveillance like this well the first of all is that whenever you start discussing about these revelations there will be naysayers trying to minimize the importance of these revelations saying that we knew all this already we knew it was happening theres nothing new here
and thats not true dont let anybody tell you that we knew this already because we did not know this already
our worst fears might have been something like this but we didnt know this was happening
now we know for a fact its happening
we didnt know about this we didnt know about prism
we didnt know about xkeyscore we didnt know about cybertrans
we didnt know about doublearrow
we did not know about skywriter all these different programs run by u s intelligence agencies
but now we do
and we did not know that u s intelligence agencies go to extremes such as infiltrating standardization bodies to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose
and what that means is that you take something which is secure an encryption algorithm which is so secure that if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file nobody can decrypt that file
even if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file its going to take millions of years
so thats basically perfectly safe uncrackable
you take something which is that good and then you weaken it on purpose making all of us less secure as an end result
a real world equivalent would be that intelligence agencies would force some secret pin code into every single house alarm so they could get into every single house because you know bad people might have house alarms but it will also make all of us backdooring encryption algorithms just boggles the mind
but of course these intelligence agencies are doing their job
this is what they have been told to do do signals intelligence monitor telecommunications monitor internet traffic
thats what theyre trying to do and since most a very big part of the internet traffic today is encrypted theyre trying to find ways around the encryption
one way is to sabotage encryption algorithms which is a great example about how u s intelligence agencies are running loose
they are completely out of control and they should be brought back under control
so what do we actually know about the leaks
everything is based on the files leaked by mr snowden
the very first prism slides from the beginning of june detail a collection program where the data is collected from service providers and they actually go and name the service providers they have access to
they even have a specific date on when the collection of data began for each of the service providers
so for example they name the collection from microsoft started on september for yahoo on the march and then others google facebook skype apple and so on
and every single one of these companies denies
they all say that this simply isnt true that they are not giving backdoor access to their data
yet we have these files
so is one of the parties lying or is there some other alternative explanation
and one explanation would be that these parties these service providers are not cooperating
instead theyve been hacked
that would explain it they arent cooperating theyve been hacked
in this case theyve been hacked by their own government
that might sound outlandish but we already have cases where this has happened for example the case of the flame malware which we strongly believe was authored by the u s government and which to spread subverted the security of the windows update network meaning here the company was hacked by their own government
and theres more evidence supporting this theory as well
der spiegel from germany leaked more information about the operations run by the elite hacker units operating inside these intelligence agencies
inside nsa the unit is called tao tailored access operations and inside gchq which is the u k equivalent its called nac network analysis centre
and these recent leaks of these three slides detail an operation run by this gchq intelligence agency from the united kingdom targeting a telecom here in belgium
and what this really means is that an e u countrys intelligence agency is breaching the security of a telecom of a fellow e u country on purpose and they discuss it in their slides completely casually business as usual
heres the primary target heres the secondary target heres the teaming
they probably have a team building on thursday evening in a pub
they even use cheesy powerpoint clip art like you know success when they gain access to services like this
what the hell
and then theres the argument that okay yes this might be going on but then again other countries are doing it as well
all countries spy
and maybe thats true
many countries spy not all of them but lets take an example
lets take for example sweden
im speaking of sweden because sweden has a little bit of a similar law to the united states
when your data traffic goes through sweden their intelligence agency has a legal right by the law to intercept that traffic
all right how many swedish decisionmakers and politicians and business leaders use every day u s based services like you know run windows or osx or use facebook or linkedin or store their data in clouds like icloud or skydrive or dropbox or maybe use online services like amazon web services or sales support
and the answer is every single swedish business leader does that every single day
and then we turn it around
how many american leaders use swedish webmails and cloud services
and the answer is zero
so this is not balanced
its not balanced by any means not even close
and when we do have the occasional european success story even those then typically end up being sold to the united states
like skype used to be secure
it used to be end to end encrypted
then it was sold to the united states
today it no longer is secure
so once again we take something which is secure and then we make it less secure on purpose making all of us less secure as an outcome
and then the argument that the united states is only fighting terrorists
its the war on terror
you shouldnt worry about it
well its not the war on terror
yes part of it is war on terror and yes there are terrorists and they do kill and maim and we should fight them but we know through these leaks that they have used the same techniques to listen to phone calls of european leaders to tap the email of residents of mexico and brazil to read email traffic inside the united nations headquarters and e u parliament and i dont think they are trying to find terrorists from inside the e u parliament right
its not the war on terror
part of it might be and there are terrorists but are we really thinking about terrorists as such an existential threat that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them
are the americans ready to throw away the constituion and throw it in the trash just because there are terrorists
and the same thing with the bill of rights and all the amendments and the universal declaration of human rights and the e u conventions on human rights and fundamental freedoms and the press freedom
do we really think terrorism is such an existential threat we are ready to do anything at all
but people are scared about terrorists and then they think that maybe that surveillance is okay because they have nothing to hide
feel free to survey me if that helps
and whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide simply hasnt thought about this long enough
because we have this thing called privacy and if you really think that you have nothing to hide please make sure thats the first thing you tell me because then i know that i should not trust you with any secrets because obviously you cant keep a secret
but people are brutally honest with the internet and when these leaks started many people were asking me about this
and i have nothing to hide
im not doing anything bad or anything illegal
yet i have nothing that i would in particular like to share with an intelligence agency especially a foreign intelligence agency
and if we indeed need a big brother i would much rather have a domestic big brother than a foreign big brother
and when the leaks started the very first thing i tweeted about this was a comment about how when youve been using search engines youve been potentially leaking all that to u s intelligence
and two minutes later i got a reply by somebody called kimberly from the united states challenging me like why am i worried about this
what am i sending to worry about this am i sending naked pictures or something
and my answer to kimberly was that what im sending is none of your business and it should be none of your governments business either
because thats what its about its about privacy
privacy is nonnegotiable
it should be built in to all the systems we use
and one thing we should all understand is that we are brutally honest with search engines
you show me your search history and ill find something incriminating or something embarrassing there in five minutes
we are more honest with search engines than we are with our families
search engines know more about you than your family members know about you
and this is all the kind of information we are giving away we are giving away to the united states
and surveillance changes history
we know this through examples of corrupt presidents like nixon
imagine if he would have had the kind of surveillance tools that are available today
and let me actually quote the president of brazil ms dilma rousseff
she was one of the targets of nsa surveillance
her email was read and she spoke at the united nations headquarters and she said if there is no right to privacy there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion and therefore there can be no effective democracy
thats what its about
privacy is the building block of our democracies
and to quote a fellow security researcher marcus ranum he said that the united states is right now treating the internet as it would be treating one of its colonies
so we are back to the age of colonization and we the foreign users of the internet we should think about americans as our masters
so mr snowden hes been blamed for many things
some are blaming him for causing problems for the u s cloud industry and software companies with these revelations and blaming snowden for causing problems for the u s cloud industry would be the equivalent of blaming al gore for causing global warming
so what is there to be done
should we worry no we shouldnt worry
we should be angry because this is wrong and its rude and it should not be done
but thats not going to really change the situation
whats going to change the situation for the rest of the world is to try to steer away from systems built in the united states
and thats much easier said than done
how do you do that
a single country any single country in europe cannot replace and build replacements for the u s made operating systems and cloud services
but maybe you dont have to do it alone
maybe you can do it together with other countries
the solution is open source
by building together open free secure systems we can go around such surveillance and then one country doesnt have to solve the problem by itself
it only has to solve one little problem
and to quote a fellow security researcher haroon meer one country only has to make a small wave but those small waves together become a tide and the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time and the tide we will build with secure free open source systems will become the tide that will lift all of us up and above the surveillance state
thank you very much

title eric sanderson new york before the city title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript years after hudson found new york harbor eric sanderson shares how he made a map of mannahattas fascinating pre city ecology of hills rivers wildlife accurate down to the block when times square was a wetland and you couldnt get delivery description
the substance of things unseen
cities past and future
in oxford perhaps we can use lewis carroll and look in the looking glass that is new york city to try and see our true selves or perhaps pass through to another world
or in the words of f scott fitzgerald as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually i became aware of the old island here that once flowered for dutch sailors eyes a fresh green breast of the new world
my colleagues and i have been working for years to rediscover this lost world in a project we call the mannahatta project
were trying to discover what henry hudson would have seen on the afternoon of september when he sailed into new york harbor
and id like to tell you the story in three acts and if i have time still an epilogue
so act i a map found
so i didnt grow up in new york
i grew up out west in the sierra nevada mountains like you see here in the red rock canyon
and from these early experiences as a child i learned to love landscapes
and so when it became time for me to do my graduate studies i studied this emerging field of landscape ecology
landscape ecology concerns itself with how the stream and the meadow and the forest and the cliffs make habitats for plants and animals
this experience and this training lead me to get a wonderful job with the wildlife conservation society which works to save wildlife and wild places all over the world
and over the last decade i traveled to over countries to see jaguars and bears and elephants and tigers and rhinos
but every time i would return from my trips id return back to new york city
and on my weekends i would go up just like all the other tourists to the top of the empire state building and id look down on this landscape on these ecosystems and id wonder how does this landscape work to make habitat for plants and animals
how does it work to make habitat for animals like me
id go to times square and id look at the amazing ladies on the wall and wonder why nobody is looking at the historical figures just behind them
id go to central park and see the rolling topography of central park come up against the abrupt and sheer topography of midtown manhattan
i started reading about the history and the geography in new york city
i read that new york city was the first mega city a city of million people or more in
i started seeing paintings like this
for those of you who are from new york this is street under the west side highway
it was once a beach and this painting has john james audubon the painter sitting on the rock
and its looking up on the wooded heights of washington heights to jeffreys hook where the george washington bridge goes across today
or this painting from the from greenwich village
those are two students at kings college later columbia university sitting on a hill overlooking a valley
and so id go down to greenwich village and id look for this hill and i couldnt find it and i couldnt find that palm tree
whats that palm tree doing there
so it was in the course of these investigations that i ran into a map
and its this map you see here
its held in a geographic information system which allows me to zoom in
this map isnt from hudsons time but from the american revolution years later made by british military cartographers during the occupation of new york city
and its a remarkable map its in the national archives here in kew
and its feet long and three and a half feet wide
and if i zoom in to lower manhattan you can see the extent of new york city as it was right at the end of the american revolution
heres bowling green and heres broadway
and this is city hall park
so the city basically extended to city hall park
and just beyond it you can see features that have vanished things that have disappeared
this is the collect pond which was the fresh water source for new york city for its first years and for the native americans for thousands of years before that
you can see the lispenard meadows draining down through here through what is tribeca now and the beaches that come up from the battery all the way to st
this map was made for military reasons
theyre mapping the roads the buildings these fortifications that they built
but theyre also mapping things of ecological interest also military interest the hills the marshes the streams
this is richmond hill and minetta water which used to run its way through greenwich village
or the swamp at gramercy park right here
or murray hill and this is the murrays house on murray hill years ago
here is times square the two streams that came together to make a wetland in times square as it was at the end of the american revolution
so i saw this remarkable map in a book
and i thought to myself you know if i could georeference this map if i could place this map in the grid of the city today i could find these lost features of the city in the block by block geography that people know the geography of where people go to work and where they go to live and where they like to eat
so after some work we were able to georeference it which allows us to put the modern streets on the city and the buildings and the open spaces so that we can zoom in to where the collect pond is
we can digitize the collect pond and the streams and see where they actually are in the geography of the city today
so this is fun for finding where things are relative to the old topography
but i had another idea about this map
if we take away the streets and if we take away the buildings and if we take away the open spaces then we could take this map
if we pull off the century features we could drive it back in time
we could drive it back to its ecological fundamentals to the hills to the streams to the basic hydrology and shoreline to the beaches the basic aspects that make the ecological landscape
then if we added maps like the geology the bedrock geology and the surface geology what the glaciers leave if we make the soil map with the soil classes that are defined by the national conservation service if we make a digital elevation model of the topography that tells us how high the hills were then we can calculate the slopes
we can calculate the aspect
we can calculate the winter wind exposure so which way the winter winds blow across the landscape
the white areas on this map are the places protected from the winter winds
we compiled all the information about where the native americans were the lenape
and we built a probability map of where they might have been
so the red areas on this map indicate the places that are best for human sustainability on manhattan places that are close to water places that are near the harbor to fish places protected from the winter winds
we know that there was a lenape settlement down here by the collect pond
and we knew that they planted a kind of horticulture that they grew these beautiful gardens of corn beans and squash the three sisters garden
so we built a model that explains where those fields might have been
and the old fields the successional fields that go
and we might think of these as abandoned
but in fact theyre grassland habitats for grassland birds and plants
and they have become successional shrub lands and these then mix in to a map of all the ecological communities
and it turns out that manhattan had different ecosystem types
you can think of these as neighborhoods as distinctive as tribeca and the upper east side and inwood that these are the forest and the wetlands and the marine communities the beaches
and is a lot on a per area basis manhattan had more ecological communities per acre than yosemite does than yellowstone than amboseli
it was really an extraordinary landscape that was capable of supporting an extraordinary biodiversity
so act ii a home reconstructed
so we studied the fish and the frogs and the birds and the bees the different kinds of fish that were on manhattan the heath hens the species that arent there anymore the beavers on all the streams the black bears and the native americans to study how they used and thought about their landscape
we wanted to try and map these and to do that what we did was we mapped their habitat needs
where do they get their food
where do they get their water where do they get their shelter
where do they get their reproductive resources
to an ecologist the intersection of these is habitat but to most people the intersection of these is their home
so we would read in field guides the standard field guides that maybe you have on your shelves you know what beavers need is a slowly meandering stream with aspen trees and alders and willows near the water thats the best thing for a beaver
so we just started making a list
here is the beaver and here is the stream and the aspen and the alder and the willow
as if these were the maps that we would need to predict where you would find the beaver
or the bog turtle needing wet meadows and insects and sunny places
or the bobcat needing rabbits and beavers and den sites
and rapidly we started to realize that beavers can be something that a bobcat needs
but a beaver also needs things and that having it on either side means that we can link it together that we can create the network of the habitat relationships for these species
moreover we realized that you can start out as being a beaver specialist but you can look up what an aspen needs
an aspen needs fire and dry soils
and you can look at what a wet meadow needs
and it need beavers to create the wetlands and maybe some other things
but you can also talk about sunny places
so what does a sunny place need not habitat per se
but what are the conditions that make it possible
or fire or dry soils
and that you can put these on a grid thats columns long across the top and rows down the other way
and then we can visualize this data like a network like a social network
and this is the network of all the habitat relationships of all the plants and animals on manhattan and everything they needed going back to the geology going back to time and space at the very core of the web
we call this the muir web and if you zoom in on it it looks like this
each point is a different species or a different stream or a different soil type
and those little gray lines are the connections that connect them together
they are the connections that actually make nature resilient
and the structure of this is what makes nature work seen with all its parts
we call these muir webs after the scottish american naturalist john muir who said when we try to pick out anything by itself we find that its bound fast by a thousand invisible cords that cannot be broken to everything in the universe
so then we took the muir webs and we took them back to the maps
so if we wanted to go between and and lex and third maybe there was a stream in that block
and these would be the kind of trees that might have been there and the flowers and the lichens and the mosses the butterflies the fish in the stream the birds in the trees
maybe a timber rattlesnake lived there
and perhaps a black bear walked by and maybe native americans were there
and then we took this data
you can see this for yourself on our website
you can zoom into any block on manhattan and see what might have been there years ago
and we used it to try and reveal a landscape here in act iii
we used the tools they use in hollywood to make these fantastic landscapes that we all see in the movies
and we tried to use it to visualize third avenue
so we would take the landscape and we would build up the topography
wed lay on top of that the soils and the waters and illuminate the landscape
we would lay on top of that the map of the ecological communities
and feed into that the map of the species
so that we would actually take a photograph flying above times square looking toward the hudson river waiting for hudson to come
using this technology we can make these fantastic georeferenced views
we can basically take a picture out of any window on manhattan and see what that landscape looked like years ago
this is the view from the east river looking up murray hill at where the united nations is today
this is the view looking down the hudson river with manhattan on the left and new jersey out on the right looking out toward the atlantic ocean
this is the view over times square with the beaver pond there looking out toward the east
so we can see the collect pond and lispenard marshes back behind
we can see the fields that the native americans made
and we can see this in the geography of the city today
so when youre watching law and order and the lawyers walk up the steps they could have walked back down those steps of the new york court house right into the collect pond years ago
so these images are the work of my friend and colleague mark boyer who is here in the audience today
and id just like if you would give him a hand to call out for his fine work
there is such power in bringing science and visualization together that we can create images like this perhaps looking on either side of a looking glass
and even though ive only had a brief time to speak i hope you appreciate that mannahatta was a very special place
the place that you see here on the left side was interconnected it was based on this diversity
it had this resilience that is what we need in our modern world
but i wouldnt have you think that i dont like the place on the right which i quite do ive come to love the city and its kind of diversity and its resilience and its dependence on density and how were connected together
in fact that i see them as reflections of each other much as lewis carroll did in through the looking glass
we can compare these two and hold them in our minds at the same time that they really are the same place that there is no way that cities can escape from nature
and i think this is what were learning about building cities in the future
so if youll allow me a brief epilogue not about the past but about years from now what were realizing is that cities are habitats for people and need to supply what people need a sense of home food water shelter reproductive resources and a sense of meaning
this is the particular additional habitat requirement of humanity
and so many of the talks here at ted are about meaning about bringing meaning to our lives in all kinds of different ways through technology through art through science so much so that i think we focus so much on that side of our lives that we havent given enough attention to the food and the water and the shelter and what we need to raise the kids
so how can we envision the city of the future
well what if we go to madison square park and we imagine it without all the cars and bicycles instead and large forests and streams instead of sewers and storm drains
what if we imagined the upper east side with green roofs and streams winding through the city and windmills supplying the power we need
or if we imagine the new york city metropolitan area currently home to million people but million people in the future perhaps living at the density of manhattan in only percent of the area with the areas in between covered by farmland covered by wetlands covered by the marshes we need
this is the kind of future i think we need is a future that has the same diversity and abundance and dynamism of manhattan but that learns from the sustainability of the past of the ecology the original ecology of nature with all its parts
thank you very much

title charlie todd the shared experience of absurdity title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript charlie todd causes bizarre hilarious and unexpected public scenes seventy synchronized dancers in storefront windows ghostbusters running through the new york public library and the annual no pants subway ride his group improv everywhere uses these scenes to bring people together description
i started improv everywhere about years ago when i moved to new york city with an interest in acting and comedy
because i was new to the city i didnt have access to a stage so i decided to create my own in public places
so the first project were going to take a look at is the very first no pants subway ride
now this took place in january of
and this woman is the star of the video
she doesnt know shes being filmed
shes being filmed with a hidden camera
this is on the train in new york city
and this is the first stop along the line
these are two danish guys who come out and sit down next to the hidden camera
and thats me right there in a brown coat
its about degrees outside
im wearing a hat im wearing a scarf
and the girls going to notice me right here
and as youll see now im not wearing pants
so at this point at this point shes noticed me but in new york theres weirdos on any given train car
one persons not that unusual
she goes back to reading her book which is unfortunately titled rape
so shes noticed the unusual thing but shes gone back to her normal life
now in the meantime i have six friends who are waiting at the next six consecutive stops in their underwear as well
theyre going to be entering this car one by one
well act as though we dont know each other
and well act as if its just an unfortunate mistake weve made forgetting our pants on this cold january day
so at this point she decides to put the rape book away
and she decides to be a little bit more aware of her surroundings
now in the meantime the two danish guys to the left of the camera theyre cracking up
they think this is the funniest thing theyve ever seen before
and watch her make eye contact with them right about now
and i love that moment in this video because before it became a shared experience it was something that was maybe a little bit scary or something that was at least confusing to her
and then once it became a shared experience it was funny and something that she could laugh at
so the train is now pulling into the third stop along the line
so the video wont show everything
this goes on for another four stops
a total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear
at the eighth stop a girl came in with a giant duffel bag and announced she had pants for sale for a dollar like you might sell batteries or candy on the train
we all very matter of factly bought a pair of pants put them on and said thank you thats exactly what i needed today and then exited without revealing what had happened and went in all different directions
thank you
so thats a still from the video there
and i love that girls reaction so much
and watching that videotape later that day inspired me to keep doing what i do
and really one of the points of improv everywhere is to cause a scene in a public place that is a positive experience for other people
its a prank but its a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell
and her reaction inspired me to do a second annual no pants subway ride
and weve continued to do it every year
this january we did the annual no pants subway ride where a diverse group of people rode the train in their underwear in new york almost every single train line in the city
and also in other cities around the world people participated
as i started taking improv class at the upright citizens brigade theater and meeting other creative people and other performers and comedians i started amassing a mailing list of people who wanted to do these types of projects
so i could do more large scale projects
well one day i was walking through union square and i saw this building which had just been built in
and there was a girl in one of the windows and she was dancing
and it was very peculiar because it was dark out but she was back lit with florescent lighting and she was very much onstage and i couldnt figure out why she was doing it
after about seconds her friend appeared she had been hiding behind a display and they laughed and hugged each other and ran away
so it seemed like maybe she had been dared to do this
so i got inspired by that
looking at the entire facade there were total windows and i knew what i had to do
so this project is called look up more we had actors dress in black
this was completely unauthorized
we didnt let the stores know we were coming
and i stood in the park giving signals
the first signal was for everybody to hold up these four foot tall letters that spelled out look up more the name of the project
the second signal was for everybody to do jumping jacks together
youll see that start right here
and then we had dancing we had everyone dance
and then we had dance solos where only one person would dance and everybody would point to them
so then i gave a new hand signal which signaled the next soloist down below in forever and he danced
there were several other activities
we had people jumping up and down people dropping to the ground
and i was standing just anonymously in a sweatshirt putting my hand on and off of a trashcan to signal the advancement
and because it was in union square park right by a subway station there were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up and watched what we were doing
theres a better photo of it
so that particular event was inspired by a moment that i happened to stumble upon
the next project i want to show was given to me in an email from a stranger
a high school kid in texas wrote me in and said you should get as many people as possible to put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants and go into a best buy and stand around
so i wrote this high school kid back immediately and i said yes you are correct
i think ill try to do that this weekend thank you
so heres the video
so again this is
this is the best buy in new york city
we had about people show up to participate entering one by one
there was an eight year old girl a year old girl
there was also a year old man who participated
so a very diverse group of people
and i told people dont work dont actually do work
but also dont shop
just stand around and dont face products
now you can see the regular employees by the ones that have the yellow tags on their shirt
everybody else is one of our actors
the lower level employees thought it was very funny
and in fact several of them went to go get their camera from the break room and took photos with us
a lot of them made jokes about trying to get us to go to the back to get heavy television sets for customers
the managers and the security guards on the other hand did not find it particularly funny
you can see them in this footage
theyre wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt
and we were there probably minutes before the managers decided to dial
so they started running around telling everybody the cops were coming watch out the cops were coming
and you can see the cops in this footage right here
thats a cop wearing black right there being filmed with a hidden camera
ultimately the police had to inform best buy management that it was not in fact illegal to wear a blue polo shirt and khaki pants
thank you
so we had been there for minutes we were happy to exit the store
one thing the managers were trying to do was to track down our cameras
and they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags
but the one camera guy they never caught was the guy that went in just with a blank tape and went over to the best buy camera department and just put his tape in one of their cameras and pretended to shop
so i like that concept of using their own technology against them
i think our best projects are ones that are site specific and happen at a particular place for a reason
and one morning i was riding the subway
i had to make a transfer at the st stop where there are these two giant escalators
and its a very depressing place to be in the morning its very crowded
so i decided to try and stage something that could make it as happy as possible for one morning
so this was in the winter of in the morning
its morning rush hour
its very cold outside
people are coming in from queens transferring from the e train to the train
and theyre going up these giant escalators on their way to their jobs
so theres a photograph that illustrates it a little bit better
he gave high fives that day and he washed his hands before and afterward and did not get sick
and that was done also without permission although no one seemed to care
so id say over the years one of the most common criticisms i see of improv everywhere left anonymously on youtube comments is these people have too much time on their hands
and you know not everybodys going to like everything you do and ive certainly developed a thick skin thanks to internet comments but that ones always bothered me because we dont have too much time on our hands
the participants at improv everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other new yorkers they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way
you know every saturday and sunday hundreds of thousands of people each fall gather in football stadiums to watch games
and ive never seen anybody comment looking at a football game saying all those people in the stands they have too much time on their hands
and of course they dont
its a perfectly wonderful way to spent a weekend afternoon watching a football game in a stadium
but i think its also a perfectly valid way to spend an afternoon freezing in place with people in the grand central terminal or dressing up like a ghostbuster and running through the new york public library
or listening to the same as other people and dancing silently in a park or bursting into song in a grocery store as part of a spontaneous musical or diving into the ocean in coney island wearing formal attire
you know as kids were taught to play
and were never given a reason why we should play
its just acceptable that play is a good thing
and i think thats sort of the point of improv everywhere
its that there is no point and that there doesnt have to be a point
we dont need a reason
as long as its fun and it seems like its going to be a funny idea and it seems like the people who witness it will also have a fun time then thats enough for us
and i think as adults we need to learn that theres no right or wrong way to play
thank you very much

title edi rama take back your city with paint title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript make a city beautiful curb corruption edi rama took this deceptively simple path as mayor of tirana albania where he instilled pride in his citizens by transforming public spaces with colorful designs with projects that put the people first rama decreased crime and showed his citizens they could have faith in their leaders description
in my previous life i was an artist
i still paint i love art
i love the joy that color can give to our lives and to our communities and i try to bring something of the artist in me in my politics and i see part of my job today the reason for being here not just to campaign for my party but for politics and the role it can play for the better in our lives
for years i was mayor of tirana our capital
we faced many challenges
art was part of the answer and my name in the very beginning was linked with two things demolition of illegal constructions in order to get public space back and use of colors in order to revive the hope that had been lost in my city
but this use of colors was not just an artistic act
rather it was a form of political action in a context when the city budget i had available after being elected amounted to zero comma something
when we painted the first building by splashing a radiant orange on the somber gray of a facade something unimaginable happened
there was a traffic jam and a crowd of people gathered as if it were the location of some spectacular accident or the sudden sighting of a visiting pop star
the french e u official in charge of the funding rushed to block the painting
he screeched that he would block the financing
but why i asked him
because the colors you have ordered do not meet european standards he replied
well i told him the surroundings do not meet european standards even though this is not what we want but we will choose the colors ourselves because this is exactly what we want
and if you do not let us continue with our work i will hold a press conference here right now right in this road and we will tell people that you look to me just like the censors of the socialist realism era
then he was kind of troubled and asked me for a compromise
but i told him no im sorry compromise in colors is gray and we have enough gray to last us a lifetime
so its time for change
the rehabilitation of public spaces revived the feeling of belonging to a city that people lost
the pride of people about their own place of living and there were feelings that had been buried deep for years under the fury of the illegal barbaric constructions that sprang up in the public space
and when colors came out everywhere a mood of change started transforming the spirit of people
big noise raised up what is this what is happening
what are colors doing to us
and we made a poll the most fascinating poll ive seen in my life
we asked people do you want this action and to have buildings painted like that
and then the second question was do you want it to stop or do you want it to continue
to the first question percent of people said yes we like it
thirty seven said no we dont like it
but to the second question half of them that didnt like it they wanted it to continue
so we noticed change
people started to drop less litter in the streets for example started to pay taxes started to feel something they had forgotten and beauty was acting as a guardsman where municipal police or the state itself were missing
one day i remember walking along a street that had just been colored and where we were in the process of planting trees when i saw a shopkeeper and his wife putting a glass facade to their shop
they had thrown the old shutter in the garbage collection place
why did you throw away the shutters i asked him
well because the street is safer now they answered
safer why they have posted more policemen here
come on man what policemen
you can see it for yourself there are colors streetlights new pavement with no potholes trees so its beautiful its safe
and indeed it was beauty that was giving people this feeling of being protected
and this was not a misplaced feeling
crime did fall
the freedom that was won in brought about a state of anarchy in the city while the barbarism of the brought about a loss of hope for the city
the paint on the walls did not feed children nor did it tend the sick or educate the ignorant but it gave hope and light and helped to make people see there could be a different way of doing things a different spirit a different feel to our lives and that if we brought the same energy and hope to our politics we could build a better life for each other and for our country
we removed tons of concrete only from the riverbanks
we demolished more than illegal buildings all over the city up to eight stories high the tallest of them
we planted trees and bushes in the streets
we established a green tax and then everybody accepted it and all businessmen paid it regularly
by means of open competitions we managed to recruit in our administration many young people and we thus managed to build a de politicized public institution where men and women were equally represented
international organizations have invested a lot in albania during these years not all of it well spent
when i told the world bank directors that i wanted them to finance a project to build a model reception hall for citizens precisely in order to fight endemic daily corruption they did not understand me
but people were waiting in long queues under sun and under rain in order to get a certificate or just a simple answer from two tiny windows of two metal kiosks
they were paying in order to skip the queue the long queue
the reply to their requests was met by a voice coming from this dark hole and on the other hand a mysterious hand coming out to take their documents while searching through old documents for the bribe
we could change the invisible clerks within the kiosks every week but we could not change this corrupt practice
im convinced i told a german official with the world bank that it would be impossible for them to be bribed if they worked in germany in a german administration just as i am convinced that if you put german officials from the german administration in those holes they would be bribed just the same
its not about genes
its not about some being with a high conscience and some others having not a conscience
its about system its about organization
its also about environment and respect
we removed the kiosks
we built the bright new reception hall that made people tirana citizens think they had traveled abroad when they entered to make their requests
we created an online system of control and so speeded up all the processes
we put the citizen first and not the clerks
the corruption in the state administration of countries like albania its not up to me to say also like greece can be fought only by modernization
reinventing the government by reinventing politics itself is the answer and not reinventing people based on a ready made formula that the developed world often tries in vain to impose to people like us
things have come to this point because politicians in general but especially in our countries lets face it think people are stupid
they take it for granted that come what may people have to follow them while politics more and more fails to offer answers for their public concerns or the exigencies of the common people
politics has come to resemble a cynical team game played by politicians while the public has been pushed aside as if sitting on the seats of a stadium in which passion for politics is gradually making room for blindness and desperation
seen from those stairs all politicians today seem the same and politics has come to resemble a sport that inspires more aggressiveness and pessimism than social cohesion and the desire for civic protaganism
barack obama won because he mobilized people as never before through the use of social networks
he did not know each and every one of them but with an admirable ingenuity he managed to transform them into activists by giving them all the possibility to hold in their hands the arguments and the instruments that each would need to campaign in his name by making his own campaign
i tweet i love it
i love it because it lets me get the message out but it also lets people get their messages to me
this is politics not from top down but from the bottom up and sideways and allowing everybodys voice to be heard is exactly what we need
politics is not just about leaders
its not just about politicians and laws
it is about how people think how they view the world around them how they use their time and their energy
when people say all politicians are the same ask yourself if obama was the same as bush if françois hollande is the same as sarkozy
they are not they are human beings with different views and different visions for the world
when people say nothing can change just stop and think what the world was like years ago
our world is defined by the pace of change
we can all change the world
i gave you a very small example of how one thing the use of color can make change happen
i want to make more change as prime minister of my country but every single one of you can make change happen if you want to
president roosevelt he said believe you can and you are halfway there

title anupam mishra the ancient ingenuity of water harvesting title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript with wisdom and wit anupam mishra talks about the amazing feats of engineering built centuries ago by the people of indias golden desert to harvest water these ancient aqueducts and stepwells are still used today and are often superior to modern water megaprojects description
for emotions we should not move quickly to the desert
so first a small housekeeping announcement please switch off your proper english check programs installed in your brain
so welcome to the golden desert indian desert
it receives the least rainfall in the country lowest rainfall
if you are well versed with inches nine inches centimeters
the groundwater is feet deep meters
and in most parts it is saline not fit for drinking
so you cant install hand pumps or dig wells though there is no electricity in most of the villages
but suppose you use the green technology solar pumps they are of no use in this area
so welcome to the golden desert
clouds seldom visit this area
but we find different names of clouds in this dialect used here
there are a number of techniques to harvest rain
this is a new work its a new program
but for the desert society this is no program this is their life
and they harvest rain in many ways
so this is the first device they use in harvesting rain
its called kunds somewhere it is called
and you can notice they have created a kind of false catchment
the desert is there sand dunes some small field
and this is all big raised platform
you can notice the small holes the water will fall on this catchment and there is a slope
sometimes our engineers and architects do not care about slopes in bathrooms but here they will care properly
and the water will go where it should go
and then it is feet deep
the waterproofing is done perfectly better than our city contractors because not a single drop should go waste in this
they collect thousand liters in one season
and this is pure drinking water
below the surface there is hard saline water
but now you can have this for year round
its two houses
we often use a term called bylaws
because we are used to get written things
but here it is unwritten by law
and people made their house and the water storage tanks
these raised up platforms just like this stage
in fact they go feet deep and collect rain water from roof there is a small pipe and from their courtyard
it can also harvest something like in a good monsoon
another big one this is of course out of the hardcore desert area
this is near jaipur this is called the jaigarh fort
and it can collect six million gallons of rainwater in one season
the age is years
so since years it has been giving you almost six million gallons of water per season
you can calculate the price of that water
it draws water from kilometers of canals
you can see a modern road hardly years old
it can break sometimes
but this year old canal which draws water it is maintained for so many generations
of course if you want to go inside the two doors are locked
but they can be opened for ted people
and we request them
you can see person coming up with two canisters of water
and the water level these are not empty canisters water level is right up to this
it can envy many municipalities the color the taste the purity of this water
and this is what they call zero b type of water because it comes from the clouds pure distilled water
we stop for a quick commercial break and then we come back to the traditional systems
the government thought that this is a very backward area and we should bring a multi million dollar project to bring water from the himalayas
thats why i said that this is a commercial break
but we will come back once again to the traditional thing
so water from kilometers away soon it become like this
in many portions water hyacinth covered these big canals like anything
of course there are some areas where water is reaching im not saying that it is not reaching at all
but the tail end the jaisalmer area you will notice in bikaner things like this where the water hyacinth couldnt grow the sand is flowing in these canals
the bonus is that you can find wildlife around it
we had full page advertisements some years years ago when this canal came
they said that throw away your traditional systems these new cement tanks will supply you piped water
its a dream and it became a dream also
because soon the water was not able to reach these areas
and people started renovating their own structures
these are all traditional water structures which we wont be able to explain in such a short time
but you can see that no woman is standing on those
and they are plaiting hair
jaisalmer this is heart of desert
this town was established years ago
im not sure by that time bombay was there or delhi was there or chennai was there or bangalore was there
so this was the terminal point for silk route
well connected years ago through europe
none of us were able to go to europe but jaisalmer was well connected to it
and this is the centimeter area
such a limited rainfall and highest colorful life flourished in these areas
you wont find water in this slide
but it is invisible
somewhere a stream or a rivulet is running through here
or if you want to paint you can paint it blue throughout because every roof which you see in this picture collects rainwater drops and deposit in the rooms
but apart from this system they designed beautiful water bodies around this town
and what we call private public partnership you can add estate also
so estate public and private entrepreneurs work together to build this beautiful water body
and its a kind of water body for all seasons
you will admire it just behold the beauty throughout the year
whether water level goes up or down the beauty is there throughout
another water body dried up of course during the summer period but you can see how the traditional society combines engineering with aesthetics with the heart
these statues marvelous statues gives you an idea of water table
when this rain comes and the water starts filling this tank it will submerge these beautiful statues in what we call in english today mass communication
this was for mass communication
everybody in the town will know that this elephant has drowned so water will be there for seven months or nine months or months
and then they will come and worship this pond pay respect their gratitude
another small water body called the
it is difficult to translate in english especially in my english
but the nearest would be glory a reputation
the reputation in desert of this small water body is that it never dries up
in severe drought periods nobody has seen this water body getting dried up
and perhaps they knew the future also
it was designed some years ago
but perhaps they knew that on sixth november there will be a ted green and blue session so they painted it like this
dry water body children are standing on a very difficult device to explain
this is called kund we have in english surface water and ground water
but this is not ground water
you can draw ground water from any well
but this is no ordinary well
it squeeze the moisture hidden in the sand
and they have dubbed this water as the third one called
and there is a gypsum belt running below it
and it was deposited by the great mother earth some three million years ago
and where we have this gypsum strip they can harvest this water
this is the same dry water body
now you dont find any kund they are all submerged
but when the water goes down they will be able to draw water from those structures throughout the year
this year they have received only six centimeters
six centimeter of rainfall and they can telephone you that if you find any water problem in your city delhi bombay bangalore mysore please come to our area of six centimeters we can give you water
how they maintain them
there are three things concept planning making the actual thing and also maintaining them
it is a structure for maintain for centuries by generations without any department without any funding so the secret is respect
your own thing not personal property my property every time
so these stone pillars will remind you that you are entering into a water body area
dont spit dont do anything wrong so that the clean water can be collected
another pillar stone pillar on your right side
if you climb these three six steps you will find something very nice
this was done in century
and you have to go further down
they say that a picture is worth a thousand words so we can say a thousand words right now an another thousand words
if the water table goes down you will find new stairs
if it comes up some of them will be submerged
so throughout the year this beautiful system will give you some pleasure
three sides such steps on the fourth side there is a four story building where you can organize such ted conferences anytime
excuse me who built these structures
they are in front of you
the best civil engineers we had the best planners the best architects
we can say that because of them because of their forefathers india could get the first engineering college in
there were no english medium schools at that time even no hindi schools schools
but such people compelled to the east india company which came here for business a very dirty kind of business
but not to create the engineering colleges
but because of them first engineering college was created in a small village not in the town
the last point we all know in our primary schools that that camel is a ship of desert
so you can find through your jeep a camel and a cart
this tire comes from the airplane
so look at the beauty from the desert society who can harvest rainwater and also create something through a tire from a jet plane and used in a camel cart
last picture its a tattoo years old tattoo
they were using it on their body
tattoo was at one time a kind of a blacklisted or con thing but now it is in thing
you can copy this tattoo i have some posters of this
the center of life is water
these are the beautiful waves
these are the beautiful stairs which we just saw in one of the slides
these are the trees
and these are the flowers which add fragrance to our lives
so this is the message of desert
thank you very much
chris anderson so first of all i wish i had your eloquence truly in any language
these artifacts and designs are inspiring
do you believe that they can be used elsewhere that the world can learn from this
or is this just right for this place
anupam mishra no the basic idea is to utilize water that falls on our area
so the ponds the open bodies are everywhere right from sri lanka to kashmir and in other parts also
and these which stored water there are two type of things
one recharge and one stores
so it depends on the terrain
but kund which uses the gypsum belt for that you have to go back to your calendar three million years ago
if it is there it can be done right now
otherwise it cant be done
ca thank you so much

title dan meyer math class needs a makeover title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript todays math curriculum is teaching students to expect and excel at paint by numbers classwork robbing kids of a skill more important than solving problems formulating them dan meyer shows classroom tested math exercises that prompt students to stop and think description
can i ask you to please recall a time when you really loved something a movie an album a song or a book and you recommended it wholeheartedly to someone you also really liked and you anticipated that reaction you waited for it and it came back and the person hated it
so by way of introduction that is the exact same state in which i spent every working day of the last six years
i teach high school math
i sell a product to a market that doesnt want it but is forced by law to buy it
i mean its just a losing proposition
so theres a useful stereotype about students that i see a useful stereotype about you all
i could give you guys an algebra two final exam and i would expect no higher than a percent pass rate
and both of these facts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call math education in the u s today
to start with id like to break math down into two categories
one is computation this is the stuff youve forgotten
for example factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one
this stuff is also really easy to relearn provided you have a really strong grounding in reasoning math reasoning well call it the application of math processes to the world around us this is hard to teach
this is what we would love students to retain even if they dont go into mathematical fields
this is also something that the way we teach it in the u s
all but ensures they wont retain it
so id like to talk about why that is why thats such a calamity for society what we can do about it and to close with why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher
so first five symptoms that youre doing math reasoning wrong in your classroom
one is a lack of initiative your students dont self start
you finish your lecture block and immediately you have five hands going up asking you to re explain the entire thing at their desks
students lack perseverance
they lack retention you find yourself re explaining concepts three months later wholesale
theres an aversion to word problems which describes percent of my students
and then the other one percent is eagerly looking for the formula to apply in that situation
this is really destructive
david milch creator of deadwood and other amazing tv shows has a really good description for this
he swore off creating contemporary drama shows set in the present day because he saw that when people fill their mind with four hours a day of for example two and a half men no disrespect it shapes the neural pathways he said in such a way that they expect simple problems
he called it an impatience with irresolution
youre impatient with things that dont resolve quickly
you expect sitcom sized problems that wrap up in minutes three commercial breaks and a laugh track
and ill put it to all of you what you already know that no problem worth solving is that simple
i am very concerned about this because im going to retire in a world that my students will run
im doing bad things to my own future and well being when i teach this way
im here to tell you that the way our textbooks particularly mass adopted textbooks teach math reasoning and patient problem solving its functionally equivalent to turning on two and a half men and calling it a day
in all seriousness heres an example from a physics textbook
it applies equally to math
notice first of all here that you have exactly three pieces of information there each of which will figure into a formula somewhere eventually which the student will then compute
i believe in real life
and ask yourself what problem have you solved ever that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance where you didnt have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out or you didnt have sufficient information and had to go find some
im sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that
and the textbook i think knows how its hamstringing students because watch this this is the practice problem set
when it comes time to do the actual problem set we have problems like this right here where were just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit
and if the student still doesnt recognize the stamp this was molded from it helpfully explains to you what sample problem you can return to to find the formula
you could literally i mean this pass this particular unit without knowing any physics just knowing how to decode a textbook thats a shame
so i can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math
heres a really cool problem i like this
its about defining steepness and slope using a ski lift
but what you have here is actually four separate layers and im curious which of you can see the four separate layers and particularly how when theyre compressed together and presented to the student all at once how that creates this impatient problem solving
ill define them here you have the visual
you also have the mathematical structure talking about grids measurements labels points axes that sort of thing
you have substeps which all lead to what we really want to talk about which section is the steepest
so i hope you can see
i really hope you can see how what were doing here is taking a compelling question a compelling answer but were paving a smooth straight path from one to the other and congratulating our students for how well they can step over the small cracks in the way
thats all were doing here
so i want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students we can have everything were looking for in terms of patient problem solving
so right here i start with the visual and i immediately ask the question which section is the steepest
and this starts conversation because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers
so you get people arguing against each other friend versus friend in pairs journaling whatever
and then eventually we realize its getting annoying to talk about the skier in the lower left hand side of the screen or the skier just above the mid line
and we realize how great would it be if we just had some a b c and d labels to talk about them more easily
and then as we start to define what does steepness mean we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down specifically what that means
and then and only then we throw down that mathematical structure
the math serves the conversation the conversation doesnt serve the math
and at that point ill put it to you that nine out of classes are good to go on the whole slope steepness thing
but if you need to your students can then develop those substeps together
do you guys see how this right here compared to that which one creates that patient problem solving that math reasoning
its been obvious in my practice to me
and ill yield the floor here for a second to einstein who i believe has paid his dues
he talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important and yet in my practice in the u s here we just give problems to students we dont involve them in the formulation of the problem
so percent of what i do with my five hours of prep time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my textbook and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving
and heres how it works
i like this question its about a water tank
the question is how long will it take you to fill it up
first things first we eliminate all the substeps
students have to develop those they have to formulate those
and then notice that all the information written on there is stuff youll need
none of its a distractor so we lose that
students need to decide all right well does the height matter does the side of it matter
does the color of the valve matter what matters here
such an underrepresented question in math curriculum
so now we have a water tank
how long will it take you to fill it up and thats it
and because this is the century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in textbooks we go out and we take a picture of it
so now we have the real deal
how long will it take it to fill it up
and then even better is we take a video a video of someone filling it up
and its filling up slowly agonizingly slowly
its tedious
students are looking at their watches rolling their eyes and theyre all wondering at some point or another man how long is it going to take to fill up
thats how you know youve baited the hook right
and that question off this right here is really fun for me because like the intro i teach kids because of my inexperience i teach the kids that are the most remedial all right
and ive got kids who will not join a conversation about math because someone else has the formula someone else knows how to work the formula better than me so i wont talk about it
but here every student is on a level playing field of intuition
everyones filled something up with water before so i get kids answering the question how long will it take
ive got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation
we put names on the board attach them to guesses and kids have bought in here
and then we follow the process ive described
and the best part here or one of the better parts is that we dont get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teachers edition
we instead just watch the end of the movie
and thats terrifying because the theoretical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teachers edition thats great but its scary to talk about sources of error when the theoretical does not match up with the practical
but those conversations have been so valuable among the most valuable
so im here to report some really fun games with students who come pre installed with these viruses day one of the class
these are the kids who now one semester in i can put something on the board totally new totally foreign and theyll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year which is just so fun
were no longer averse to word problems because weve redefined what a word problem is
were no longer intimidated by math because were slowly redefining what math is
this has been a lot of fun
i encourage math teachers i talk to to use multimedia because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color to encourage student intuition for that level playing field to ask the shortest question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation to let students build the problem because einstein said so and to finally in total just be less helpful because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways its buying you out of your obligation for patient problem solving and math reasoning to be less helpful
and why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high quality curriculum in our front pocket
its ubiquitous and fairly cheap and the tools to distribute it freely under open licenses has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous
i put a video series on my blog not so long ago and it got views in two weeks
i get emails still from teachers in countries ive never visited saying wow yeah we had a good conversation about that
oh and by the way heres how i made your stuff better which wow
i put this problem on my blog recently in a grocery store which line do you get into the one that has one cart and items or the line with four carts and three five two and one items
and the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom but it eventually got me on good morning america a few weeks later which is just bizarre right
and from all of this i can only conclude that people not just students are really hungry for this
math makes sense of the world
math is the vocabulary for your own intuition
so i just really encourage you whatever your stake is in education whether youre a student parent teacher policy maker whatever insist on better math curriculum
we need more patient problem solvers thank you

title mariana mazzucato government investor risk taker innovator title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript why doesn t the government just get out of the way and let the private sector the real revolutionaries innovate it s rhetoric you hear everywhere and mariana mazzucato wants to dispel it in an energetic talk she shows how the state which many see as a slow hunkering behemoth is really one of our most exciting risk takers and market shapers description
have you ever asked yourselves why it is that companies the really cool companies the innovative ones the creative new economy type companies apple google facebook are coming out of one particular country the united states of america
usually when i say this someone says spotify
thats europe but yeah
it has not had the impact that these other companies have had
now what i do is im an economist and i actually study the relationship between innovation and economic growth at the level of the company the industry and the nation and i work with policymakers worldwide especially in the european commission but recently also in interesting places like china and i can tell you that that question is on the tip of all of their tongues where are the european googles
what is the secret behind the silicon valley growth model which they understand is different from this old economy growth model
and what is interesting is that often even if were in the century we kind of come down in the end to these ideas of market versus state
its talked about in these modern ways but the idea is that somehow behind places like silicon valley the secret have been different types of market making mechanisms the private initiative whether this be about a dynamic venture capital sector thats actually able to provide that high risk finance to these innovative companies the gazelles as we often call them which traditional banks are scared of or different types of really successful commercialization policies which actually allow these companies to bring these great inventions their products to the market and actually get over this really scary death valley period in which many companies instead fail
but what really interests me especially nowadays and because of whats happening politically around the world is the language thats used the narrative the discourse the images the actual words
so we often are presented with the kind of words like that the private sector is also much more innovative because its able to think out of the box
they are more dynamic
think of steve jobs really inspirational speech to the graduating class at stanford where he said to be innovative youve got to stay hungry stay foolish
right so these guys are kind of the hungry and foolish and colorful guys right
and in places like europe it might be more equitable we might even be a bit better dressed and eat better than the u s but the problem is this damn public sector
its a bit too big and it hasnt actually allowed these things like dynamic venture capital and commercialization to actually be able to really be as fruitful as it could
and even really respectable newspapers some that im actually subscribed to the words they use are you know the state as this leviathan right
this monster with big tentacles
theyre very explicit in these editorials
they say you know the state its necessary to fix these little market failures when you have public goods or different types of negative externalities like pollution but you know what what is the next big revolution we all hope it might be something green or all of this nanotech stuff and in order for that stuff to happen they say this was a special issue on the next industrial revolution they say the state just stick to the basics right
fund the infrastructure fund the schools
even fund the basic research because this is popularly recognized in fact as a big public good which private companies dont want to invest in do that but you know what
leave the rest to the revolutionaries
theyre often called garage tinkerers because some of them actually did some things in garages even though thats partly a myth
and so what i want to do with you in oh god only minutes is to really think again this juxtaposition because it actually has massive massive implications beyond innovation policy which just happens to be the area that i often talk with with policymakers
it has huge implications even with this whole notion that we have on where when and why we should actually be cutting back on public spending and different types of public services which of course as we know are increasingly being outsourced because of this juxtaposition
right i mean the reason that we need to maybe have free schools or charter schools is in order to make them more innovative without being emburdened by this heavy hand of the state curriculum or something
so these kind of words are constantly these juxtapositions come up everywhere not just with innovation policy
and so to think again theres no reason that you should believe me so just think of some of the smartest revolutionary things that you have in your pockets and do not turn it on but you might want to take it out your iphone
ask who actually funded the really cool revolutionary thinking out of the box things in the iphone
what actually makes your phone a smartphone basically instead of a stupid phone
so the internet which you can surf the web anywhere you are in the world gps where you can actually know where you are anywhere in the world the touchscreen display which makes it also a really easy to use phone for anybody
these are the very smart revolutionary bits about the iphone and theyre all government funded
and the point is that the internet was funded by darpa u s department of defense
gps was funded by the militarys navstar program
even siri was actually funded by darpa
the touchscreen display was funded by two public grants by the cia and the nsf to two public university researchers at the university of delaware
now you might be thinking well shes just said the word defense and military an awful lot but whats really interesting is that this is actually true in sector after sector and department after department
so the pharmaceutical industry which i am personally very interested in because ive actually had the fortune to study it in quite some depth is wonderful to be asking this question about the revolutionary versus non revolutionary bits because each and every medicine can actually be divided up on whether it really is revolutionary or incremental
so the new molecular entities with priority rating are the revolutionary new drugs whereas the slight variations of existing drugs viagra different color different dosage are the less revolutionary ones
and it turns out that a full percent of the new molecular entities with priority rating are actually funded in boring kafka ian public sector labs
this doesnt mean that big pharma is not spending on innovation
they do they spend on the marketing part
they spend on the d part of r amp d
they spend an awful lot on buying back their stock which is quite problematic
in fact companies like pfizer and amgen recently have spent more money in buying back their shares to boost their stock price than on r amp d but thats a whole different ted talk which one day id be fascinated to tell you about
now whats interesting in all of this is the state in all these examples was doing so much more than just fixing market failures
it was actually shaping and creating markets
it was funding not only the basic research which again is a typical public good but even the applied research
it was even god forbid being a venture capitalist
so these sbir and sdtr programs which give small companies early stage finance have not only been extremely important compared to private venture capital but also have become increasingly important
why because as many of us know v c is actually quite short term
they want their returns in three to five years
innovation takes a much longer time than that to years
and so this whole notion i mean this is the point right
whos actually funding the hard stuff
of course its not just the state
the private sector does a lot
but the narrative that weve always been told is the state is important for the basics but not really providing that sort of high risk revolutionary thinking out of the box
in all these sectors from funding the internet to doing the spending but also the envisioning the strategic vision for these investments it was actually coming within the state
the nanotechnology sector is actually fascinating to study this because the word itself nanotechnology came from within government
and so theres huge implications of this
first of all of course im not someone this old fashioned person market versus state
what we all know in dynamic capitalism is that what we actually need are public private partnerships
but the point is by constantly depicting the state part as necessary but actually pffff a bit boring and often a bit dangerous kind of leviathan i think weve actually really stunted the possibility to build these public private partnerships in a really dynamic way
even the words that we often use to justify the p part the public part well theyre both ps with public private partnerships is in terms of de risking
what the public sector did in all these examples i just gave you and theres many more which myself and other colleagues have been looking at is doing much more than de risking
its kind of been taking on that risk bring it on
its actually been the one thinking out of the box
but also im sure you all have had experience with local regional national governments and youre kind of like you know what that kafka ian bureaucrat ive met him
that whole juxtaposition thing its kind of there
well theres a self fulfilling prophecy
by talking about the state as kind of irrelevant boring its sometimes that we actually create those organizations in that way
so what we have to actually do is build these entrepreneurial state organizations
darpa that funded the internet and siri actually thought really hard about this how to welcome failure because you will fail
you will fail when you innovative
one out of experiments has any success
and the v c guys know this and theyre able to actually fund the other losses from that one success
and this brings me actually probably to the biggest implication and this has huge implications beyond innovation
if the state is more than just a market fixer if it actually is a market shaper and in doing that has had to take on this massive risk what happened to the reward
we all know if youve ever taken a finance course the first thing youre taught is sort of the risk reward relationship and so some people are foolish enough or probably smart enough if they have time to wait to actually invest in stocks because theyre higher risk which over time will make a greater reward than bonds that whole risk reward thing
well wheres the reward for the state of having taken on these massive risks and actually been foolish enough to have done the internet
the internet was crazy
it really was i mean the probability of failure was massive
you had to be completely nuts to do it and luckily they were
now we dont even get to this question about rewards unless you actually depict the state as this risk taker
and the problem is that economists often think well there is a reward back to the state its tax
you know the companies will pay tax the jobs they create will create growth so people who get those jobs and their incomes rise will come back to the state through the tax mechanism
well unfortunately thats not true
okay its not true because many of the jobs that are created go abroad
globalization and thats fine we shouldnt be nationalistic
let the jobs go where they have to go perhaps
i mean one can take a position on that
but also these companies that have actually had this massive benefit from the state apples a great example
they even got the first well not the first but dollars actually went to apple the company through this sbic program which predated the sbir program as well as as i said before all the technologies behind the iphone
and yet we know they legally as many other companies pay very little tax back
so what we really need to actually rethink is should there perhaps be a return generating mechanism thats much more direct than tax why not
it could happen perhaps through equity
this by the way in the countries that are actually thinking about this strategically countries like finland in scandinavia but also in china and brazil theyre retaining equity in these investments
sitra funded nokia kept equity made a lot of money its a public funding agency in finland which then funded the next round of nokias
the brazilian development bank which is providing huge amounts of funds today to clean technology they just announced a billion program for the future on this is retaining equity in these investments
so to put it provocatively had the u s government thought about this and maybe just brought back just something called an innovation fund you can bet that you know if even just percent of the profits from what the internet produced had come back to that innovation fund there would be so much more money to spend today on green technology
instead many of the state budgets which in theory are trying to do that are being constrained
but perhaps even more important we heard before about the one percent the percent
if the state is thought about in this more strategic way as one of the lead players in the value creation mechanism because thats what were talking about right
who are the different players in creating value in the economy and is the states role has it been sort of dismissed as being a backseat player
if we can actually have a broader theory of value creation and allow us to actually admit what the state has been doing and reap something back it might just be that in the next round and i hope that we all hope that the next big revolution will in fact be green that that period of growth will not only be smart innovation led not only green but also more inclusive so that the public schools in places like silicon valley can actually also benefit from that growth because they have not

title jennifer lee the hunt for general tso title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript reporter jennifer lee talks about her hunt for the origins of familiar chinese american dishes exploring the hidden spots where these two cultures have combined to form a new cuisine description
there are more chinese restaurants in this country than mcdonalds burger king kentucky fried chicken and wendys combined actually
chinese restaurants have played an important role in american history as a matter of fact
the cuban missile crisis was resolved in a chinese restaurant called yenching palace in washington d c which unfortunately is closed now and about to be turned into walgreens
and the house that john wilkes booth planned the assassination of abraham lincoln is actually also now a chinese restaurant called wok n roll on h street in washington
and its not completely gratuitous because wok and roll chinese food and japanese foods so it kind of works out
and americans love their chinese food so much theyve actually brought it into space
nasa for example serves thermal stabilized sweet and sour pork on its shuttle menu for its astronauts
so let me present the question to you if our benchmark for americanness is apple pie you should ask yourself how often do you eat apple pie versus how often do you eat chinese food right
and if you think about it a lot of the foods that you think of or we think of or americans think of as chinese food are barely recognizable to chinese for example beef with broccoli egg rolls general tsos chicken fortune cookies chop suey the take out boxes
for example i took a whole bunch of fortune cookies back to china gave them to chinese to see how they would react
what is this
should i try it
try it
what is it called
fortune cookie
theres a piece of paper inside
what is this
youve won a prize
what is this
its a fortune
tasty
so where are they from
the short answer is actually theyre from japan
and in kyoto outside there are still small family run bakeries that make fortune cookies as they did over years ago years before fortune cookies were introduced in the united states
if you see them side by side theres yellow and brown
theirs are actually flavored with miso and sesame paste so theyre not as sweet as our version
so how did they get to the united states
well the short answer is the japanese immigrants came over and a bunch of the bakers introduced them including at least one in los angeles and one here in san francisco called benkyo do which is on the corner of sutter and buchanan
they back then actually made fortune cookies using very much the similar kind of irons that we saw back in kyoto
so the interesting question is how do you go from fortune cookies being something that is japanese to being something that is chinese
well the short answer is we locked up all the japanese during world war ii including those that made fortune cookies so thats the time when the chinese moved in kind of saw a market opportunity and took over
so fortune cookies invented by the japanese popularized by the chinese but ultimately consumed by americans
they are more american than anything else
another one of my favorite dishes general tsos chicken which by the way in the us naval academy is called admiral tsos chicken
i love this dish
the original name in my book was actually called the long march of general tso and he has marched very far indeed because he is sweet he is fried and he is chicken all things that americans love
he has marched so far actually that the chef who originally invented the dish doesnt recognize it hes kind of horrified
hes in taiwan right now
hes retired deaf and plays a lot of mahjong
so he after this i showed him he got up and hes like mominqimiao which means this is all nonsense and goes back to play his mahjong game during the afternoon
so another dish one of my favorites beef with broccoli
broccoli is not a chinese vegetable in fact it is originally an italian vegetable
it was introduced into the united states in the but became popularized in the and the
in fact the chinese had their own version of broccoli which is called chinese broccoli but right now what theyve now discovered american broccoli and are importing it as a sort of exotic delicacy
i guarantee you general tso never saw a stalk of broccoli in his life and indeed that actually was a picture of general tso
i went to his home town
this is a billboard that says welcome to the birthplace of general tso
and i went looking for chicken
finally found a cow and did find chicken
believe it or not these guys were actually crossing the road
and i actually found a whole bunch of general tsos relatives who are still in the little town
this guy is now five generations removed from the general this guy is about seven
showed them all the pictures of general tso chicken that i showed you and theyre like we dont know this dish
and then theyre like is this chinese food
because it doesnt look like chinese food to them
but they werent kind of surprised i traveled around the world to visit them because in their eyes he is after all a famous qing dynasty military hero
he played an important role in the taiping rebellion which was a war started by a guy who thought he was the son of god and the baby brother of jesus christ
and caused the war that killed million people still the deadliest civil war in the world to this day
so you know i realized when i was there general tso is kind of a lot like colonel sanders in america in that hes known for chicken and not war
but in china this guys actually known for war and not chicken
but the granddaddy of all the chinese american dishes we probably ought to talk about is chop suey which was introduced around the turn of the century
and according to new york times in there was an outbreak of chinese restaurants all over town and the city has gone chop suey mad
so it took about years before the americans realized that whoa chop suey is actually not known in china
and as this article points out the average native of any city in china knows nothing of chop suey
you know back then it was a way to show that you were sophisticated and cosmopolitan if you were a guy and you wanted to impress a girl you could take her out on a chop suey date
i like to say chop sueys the biggest culinary joke that one culture has ever played on another because chop suey if you translate into chinese means tsap sui which if you translate back means odds and ends
so these people are going around china asking for chop suey which is sort of like a japanese guy coming here and saying i understand you have a very popular dish in your country called leftovers and it is particularly right
and not only that this dish is particularly popular after that holiday you call thanksgiving
so why why and where did chop suey come from
lets go back to mid when the chinese first came to america
now back then the americans were not clamoring to eat chinese food
in fact they saw this people who landed at their shores as alien
these people werent eating dogs they were eating cats and they werent eating cats they were eating rats
in fact the new york times my esteemed employer in ran an article that asked do chinese eat rats
and not the most pc question to be asked today but if you kind of look at the popular imagery of the time not so outlandish
this is actually a real advertisement for rat poison from the late and if you see under the word clears very small it says they must go which refers not only to the rats but to the chinese in their midst because the way that the food was perceived was that these people who ate foods different from us must be different from us
and another way that you saw sort of this sort of this antipathy towards the chinese is through documents like this
this is actually in the library of congress it is a pamphlet published by samuel gompers hero of our american labor movement and its called some reason for chinese exclusion meat versus rice american manhood against asiatic coolieism which shall survive
and it basically made the argument that chinese men who ate rice would necessarily bring down the standard of living for american men who ate meat
this is one of the reasons why we must exclude them from this country so with sentiments like these the chinese exclusion act was sort of passed between and the only time in american history when a group was specifically excluded for its national origin or ethnicity
so in a way because the chinese were attacked chop suey was created as a defense mechanism
now who came up with the idea of chop suey
theres a lot of different mysteries a lot of different legends but of the ones that ive found that i thought was most interesting is this article from
a chinese guy named lem sen shows up in chinatown new york city and says i want you guys all to stop making chop suey because i am the original creator and sole proprietor of the dish known as chop suey
and the way that he tells it there was a guy there was a famous chinese diplomat that showed up and he was told to make a dish that looked very popular and could quote pass as chinese
and as he said we would never print this today but basically the american man has become very rich
lem sen whos this guy i would have made this money too but ive spent all this time looking for the american man who stole my recipe
now ive come and found him and i want my recipe back and i want everyone to stop making chop suey or pay me for the right to do the same
so it was an early exercise of intellectual property rights
so the thing is this kind of idea of chinese american food doesnt exist only in america
in fact if you think about it chinese food is the most pervasive food on the planet served on all seven continents even antarctica because monday night is chinese food night at mcmurdo station which is the main scientific station in antarctica
so you see different varieties of chinese food
for example there is french chinese food where they serve salt and pepper frog legs
there is italian chinese food where they dont have fortune cookies so they serve fried gelato
my downstairs neighbor alessandra was completely shocked when i told her dude fried gelato is not chinese
shes like its not
but they serve it in all the chinese restaurants in italy
and even the brits have their own version
this is a dish called crispy shredded beef which has a lot of crisp a lot of shred and not a lot of beef
there is west indian chinese food theres jamaican chinese food there is middle eastern chinese food theres mauritian chinese food
this is a dish called magic bowl that i discovered
theres indian chinese food korean chinese food japanese chinese food where they take the bao the little buns and they make them into pizza versions and they take and they like totally randomly theyll take chinese noodle dishes and theyll just ramen ize them
this is like this is something that in the chinese version has no soup
so theres peruvian chinese food which should not be mixed with mexican chinese food where they basically take things and make it look like fajitas
and then one thing they have things like risotto chop suey
my personal favorite of all the restaurants ive encountered around the world was this one in brazil called kung food
so lets take a step back and kind of understand what is to be appreciated in america
mcdonalds has sort of garnered a lot of attention a lot of respect for basically standardizing the menu décor and dining experience in post world war ii america
but you know what
they actually did so through a centralized headquarters out of illinois right
chinese restaurants have done largely the same thing i would argue with the menu and the décor even the restaurant name but without a centralized headquarters
so this actually became very clear to me with the march powerball drawing where you know they expected based on the number of ticket sales they had to have three or four second place winners those are the people who match five or six powerball numbers
instead they had and they were completely shocked
they looked all across the country and discovered it couldnt necessarily be fraud because it happened you know in different states across different computer systems
so whatever it was it caused people to sort of behave in a mass synchronized way
so like ok maybe it had to do with the patterns on the little pieces of paper you know like it was a diamond or you know diagonal
it wasnt that
it wasnt that so theyre like ok lets look at television so they looked at an episode of lost
now i dont have a tv which makes me a freak but very productive and and this episode of lost i understand where the overweight guy has a lucky number which was not a lucky number which was how long theyd been on the island but they looked and the numbers did not match
so they looked at the young and the restless and it wasnt that either
so it wasnt until the first guy shows up the next day and they ask him where did you get your number from
hes like oh i got it from a fortune cookie
this actually is a slip that one of the winners had because the tennessee lottery security officials were like oh no like this cant be true
but it was true and basically of those people and of them or so had gotten their number from the fortune cookie
yeah so i went and started looking
i went across the country looking for these restaurants where these people had gotten their fortune cookies from
you know there are a bunch of them including lees china in omaha which is actually run by koreans but thats another point and a bunch of them named china buffet
so whats interesting is that their stories were similar but they were different
it was lunch it was take out it was sit down it was buffet it was three weeks ago it was three months ago
but at some point all these people had a very similar experience that converged at a fortune cookie and at a chinese restaurant and all these chinese restaurants were serving fortune cookies which of course we know arent even chinese to begin with
so its kind of part of the phenomenon i called spontaneous self organization right where like in ant colonies where little decisions made by on the micro level actually have a big impact on the macro level
so a good sort of contrast is chicken mcnuggets
mcdonalds actually spent years coming out with a chicken like product
they did chicken pot pie they did fried chicken and then they finally introduced chicken mcnuggets
and the great innovation of chicken mcnuggets was not nuggetfying them because thats kind of an easy concept but the trick behind chicken mcnuggets was they were able to remove the chicken from the bone in a cost effective manner which is why it took so long for other people to copy them
it took years and then within a couple of months it was such a hit they just introduced it and rolled it across the entire system of mcdonalds in the country
in contrast we have general tsos chicken which actually started in new york city in the early as i was also starting in the university in new york city in the early so
and this logo
so me general tsos chicken and this logo are all karmacally related
but that dish also took about years to spread across america from a random restaurant in new york city
someones like oh god its sweet its fried its chicken americans will love this
so what i like to say you know this being sort of bay area silicon valley is that we think of mcdonalds as sort of the microsoft of the dining experiences
we can think of chinese restaurants perhaps as linux sort of an open source thing right where ideas from one person can be copied and propagated across the entire system that there can be specialized versions of chinese food you know depending on the region
for example you know in new orleans we have cajun chinese food where they serve sichuan alligator and sweet and sour crawfish right
and in philadelphia you have philadelphia cheesesteak roll which looks like an egg roll on the outside but a cheesesteak on the inside
i was really surprised to discover that not only in philadelphia but also in atlanta because what had happened was that a chinese family had moved from atlanta to sorry from philadelphia to atlanta and brought that with them
so the thing is our historical lore because of the way we like narratives are full of vast characters such as you know howard schultz of starbucks and ray kroc with mcdonalds and asa chandler with coca cola
but you know its very easy to overlook the smaller characters oops for example like lem sen who introduced chop suey chef peng who introduced general tso chicken and all the japanese bakers who introduced fortune cookies
so the point of my presentation is to make you think twice that those whose names are forgotten in history can often have had as much if not more impact on what we eat today
so thank you very much

title juan enriquez using biology to rethink the energy challenge title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript juan enriquez challenges our definition of bioenergy oil coal gas and other hydrocarbons are not chemical but biological products based on plant matter and thus growable our whole approach to fuel he argues needs to change description
what is bioenergy bioenergy is not ethanol
bioenergy isnt global warming bioenergy is something which seems counterintuitive bioenergy is oil its gas its coal and part of building that bridge to the future to the point where we can actually see the oceans in a rational way or put up these geo spatial orbits that will twirl or do microwaves or stuff is going to depend on how we understand bioenergy and manage it and to do that you really have to look first at agriculture
so weve been planting stuff for years and in the measure that we plant stuff what we learn from agriculture is youve got to deal with pests youve got to deal with all types of awful things youve got to cultivate stuff in the measure that you learn how to use water to cultivate then youre going to be able to spread beyond the nile
youre going to be able to power stuff so irrigation makes a difference
irrigation starts to make you be allowed to plant stuff where you want it as opposed to where the rivers flood you start getting this organic agriculture you start putting machinery onto this stuff machinery with a whole bunch of water leads to very large scale agriculture
you put together machines and water and you get landscapes that look like this and then you get sales that look like this its brute force so what youve been doing in agriculture is you start out with something thats a reasonably natural system you start taming that natural system you put a lot of force behind that natural system you put a whole bunch of pesticides and herbicides behind that natural system and you end up with systems that look like this
and its all brute force and thats the way weve been approaching energy so the lesson in agriculture is that you can actually change the system thats based on brute force as you start merging that system and learning that system and actually applying biology and you move from a discipline of engineering you move from a discipline of chemistry into a discipline of biology and probably one of the most important human beings on the planet is this guy behind me
this is a guy called norman borlaug he won the nobel prize hes got the congressional medal of honor he deserves all of this stuff and he deserves this stuff because he probably has fed more people than any other human being alive because he researched how to put biology behind seeds he did this in mexico the reason why india and china no longer have these massive famines is because norman borlaug taught them how to grow grains in a more efficient way and launched the green revolution that is something that a lot of people have criticized but of course those are people who dont realize that china and india instead of having huge amounts of starving people are exporting grains
and the irony of this particular system is the place where he did the research which was mexico didnt adopt this technology ignored this technology talked about why this technology should be thought about but not really applied
and mexico remains one of the largest grain importers on the planet because it doesnt apply technology that was discovered in mexico and in fact hasnt recognized this man to the point where there arent statues of this man all over mexico there are in china and india and the institute that this guy ran has now moved to india that is the difference between adopting technologies and discussing technologies
now its not just that this guy fed a huge amount of people in the world its that this is the net effect in terms of what technology does if you understand biology
what happened in agriculture well if you take agriculture over a century agriculture in about would have been recognizable to somebody planting a thousand years earlier yeah the plows look different the machines were tractors or stuff instead of mules but the farmer would have understood this is what the guys doing this is why hes doing it this is where hes going what really started to change in agriculture is when you started moving from this brute force engineering and chemistry into biology and thats where you get your productivity increases and as you do that stuff heres what happens to productivity
basically you go from hours to produce bushels to to to five agricultural labor productivity increased seven times to whereas the rest of the economy increased about times this is an absolutely massive increase in how much is produced per person
the effect of this of course is its not just amber waves of grain it is mountains of stuff
and percent of the eu budget is going to subsidize agriculture from mountains of stuff that people have overproduced
this would be a good outcome for energy and of course by now youre probably saying to yourself self i thought i came to a talk about energy and heres this guy talking about biology
so wheres the link between these two things
one of the ironies of this whole system is were discussing what to do about a system that we dont understand we dont even know what oil is we dont know where oil comes from i mean literally its still a source of debate what this black river of stuff is and where it comes from the best assumption and one of the best guesses in this stuff is that this stuff comes out of this stuff that these things absorb sunlight rot under pressure for millions of years and you get these black rivers
now the interesting thing about that thesis if that thesis turns out to be true is that oil and all hydrocarbons turned out to be concentrated sunlight and if you think of bioenergy bioenergy isnt ethanol bioenergy is taking the sun concentrating it in amoebas concentrating it in plants and maybe thats why you get these rainbows
and as youre looking at this system if hydrocarbons are concentrated sunlight then bioenergy works in a different way and weve got to start thinking of oil and other hydrocarbons as part of these solar panels
maybe thats one of the reasons why if you fly over west texas the types of wells that youre beginning to see dont look unlike those pictures of kansas and those irrigated plots
this is how you farm oil and as you think of farming oil and how oil has evolved we started with this brute force approach and then what did we learn then we learned we had to go bigger and then whatd we learn then we have to go even bigger and we are getting really destructive as were going out and farming this bioenergy
these are the athabasca tar sands and theres an enormous amount first of mining the largest trucks in the world are working here and then youve got to pull out this black sludge which is basically oil that doesnt flow its tied to the sand and then youve got to use a lot of steam to separate it which only works at todays oil prices
coal coal turns out to be virtually the same stuff it is probably plants except that these have been burned and crushed under pressure
so you take something like this you burn it you put it under pressure and likely as not you get this although again i stress we dont know
which is curious as we debate all this stuff but as you think of coal this is what burned wheat kernels look like not entirely unlike coal
and of course coalmines are very dangerous places because in some of these coalmines you get gas when that gas blows up people die so youre producing a biogas out of coal in some mines but not in others
any place you see a differential therere some interesting questions theres some questions as to what you should be doing with this stuff but again coal maybe the same stuff maybe the same system maybe bioenergy and youre applying exactly the same technology
heres your brute force approach once you get through your brute force approach then you just rip off whole mountaintops and you end up with the single largest source of carbon emissions which are coal fired gas plants that is probably not the best use of bioenergy
as you think of what are the alternatives to this system its important to find alternatives because it turns out that the u s is dwindling in its petroleum reserves but it is not dwindling in its coal reserves nor is china there are huge coal reserves that are sitting out there and weve got to start thinking of them as biological energy because if we keep treating them as chemical energy or engineering energy were going to be in deep doo doo
gas is a similar issue gas is also a biological product and as you think of gas well youre familiar with gas and heres a different way of mining coal
this is called coal bed methane why is this picture interesting because if coal turns out to be concentrated plant life the reason why you may get a differential in gas output between one mine and another the reason why one mine may blow up and another one may not blow up may be because theres stuff eating that stuff and producing gas
this is a well known phenomenon you eat certain things you produce a lot of gas it may turn out that biological processes in coalmines have the same process if that is true then one of the ways of getting the energy out of coal may not be to rip whole mountaintops off and it may not be to burn coal it may be to have stuff process that coal in a biological fashion as you did in agriculture
that is what bioenergy is it is not ethanol it is not subsidies to a few companies it is not importing corn into iowa because youve built so many of these ethanol plants it is beginning to understand the transition that occurred in agriculture from brute force into biological force and in the measure that you can do that you can clean some stuff and you can clean it pretty quickly
we already have some indicators of productivity on this stuff ok if you put steam into coal fields or petroleum fields that have been running for decades you can get a really substantial increase like an eight fold increase in your output this is just the beginning stages of this stuff
and as you think of biomaterials this guy who did part of the sequencing of the human genome who just doubled the databases of genes and proteins known on earth by sailing around the world has been thinking about how you structure this and theres a series of smart people thinking about this and theyve been putting together companies like synthetic genomics like a cambria like codon and what those companies are trying to do is to think of how do you apply biological principles to avoid brute force
think of it in the following terms think of it as beginning to program stuff for specific purposes
think of the cell as a hardware think of the genes as a software and in the measure that you begin to think of life as code that is interchangeable that can become energy that can become food that can become fiber that can become human beings that can become a whole series of things then youve got to shift your approach as to how youre going to structure and deal and think about energy in a very different way
what are the first principles of this stuff and where are we heading this is one of the gentle giants on the planet hes one of the nicest human beings youve ever met his name is hamilton smith he won the nobel for figuring out how to cut genes something called restriction enzymes
he was at hopkins when he did this and hes such a modest guy that the day he won his mother called him and said i didnt realize there was another ham smith at hopkins do you know he just won the nobel i mean that was mom but anyway this guy is just a class act you find him at the bench every single day working on a pipette and building stuff and one of the things this guy just built are these things
what is this this is the first transplant of naked dna where you take an entire dna operating system out of one cell insert it into a different cell and have that cell boot up as a separate species thats one month old you will see stuff in the next month that will be just as important as this stuff
and as you think about this stuff and what the implications of this are were going to start not just converting ethanol from corn with very high subsidies were going to start thinking about biology entering energy it is very expensive to process this stuff both in economic terms and in energy terms
this is what accumulates in the tar sands of alberta these are sulfur blocks because as you separate that petroleum from the sand and use an enormous amount of energy inside that vapor steam to separate this stuff you also have to separate out the sulfur the difference between light crude and heavy crude well its about bucks a barrel thats why youre building these pyramids of sulfur blocks and by the way the scale on these things is pretty large
now if you can take part of the energy content out of doing this you reduce the system and you really do start applying biological principles to energy this has to be a bridge to the point where you can get to wind to the point where you can get to solar to the point where you can get to nuclear and hopefully you wont build the next nuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to an earthquake fault just a thought
but in the meantime for the next decade at least the name of the game is hydrocarbons and be that oil be that gas be that coal this is what were dealing with and before i make this talk too long heres whats happening in the current energy system
percent of the energy we consume are hydrocarbons that means percent of the stuff were consuming are probably processed plants and amoebas and the rest of the stuff and theres a role in here for conservation theres a role in here for alternative stuff but weve also got to get that other portion right
how we deal with that other portion is our bridge to the future and as we think of this bridge to the future one of the things you should ponder is we are leaving about two thirds of the oil today inside those wells so were spending an enormous amount of money and leaving most of the energy down there which of course requires more energy to go out and get energy the ratios become idiotic by the time you get to ethanol it may even be a one to one ratio on the energy input and the energy output that is a stupid way of managing this system
last point last graph one of the things that weve got to do is to stabilize oil prices this is what oil prices look like ok
this is a very bad system because what happens is your hurdle rate gets set very low people come up with really smart ideas for solar panels or for wind or for something else and then guess what
the oil price goes through the floor that company goes out of business and then you can bring the oil price back up
so if i had one closing and modest suggestion lets set a stable oil price in europe and the united states how do you do that well lets put a tax on oil that is a non revenue tax and it basically says for the next years the price of oil will be whatever you want bucks bucks if the opec price falls below that we tax it if the opec price goes above that the tax goes away
what does that do for entrepreneurs what does it do for companies it tells people if you can produce energy for less than bucks a barrel or less than bucks a barrel or less than bucks a barrel lets debate it you will have a business but lets not put people through this cycle where it doesnt pay to research because your company will go out of business as opec drives alternatives and keeps bioenergy from happening thank you

title louise leakey a dig for humanitys origins title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript louise leakey asks who are we the question takes her to the rift valley in eastern africa where she digs for the evolutionary origins of humankind and suggests a stunning new vision of our competing ancestors description
who are we
that is the big question
and essentially we are just an upright walking big brained super intelligent ape
this could be us
we belong to the family called the hominidae
we are the species called homo sapiens sapiens and its important to remember that in terms of our place in the world today and our future on planet earth
we are one species of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet earth today
and thats just a tiny fraction of all species that have ever lived on the planet in past times
were one species out of approximately or lets say at least upright walking apes that have existed over the past six to eight million years
but as far as we know were the only upright walking ape that exists on planet earth today except for the bonobos
and its important to remember that because the bonobos are so human and they share percent of their genes with us
and we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes
its important to remember that we evolved
now i know thats a dirty word for some people but we evolved from common ancestors with the gorillas the chimpanzee and also the bonobos
we have a common past and we have a common future
and it is important to remember that all of these great apes have come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey as we ourselves have today
and its this journey that is of such interest to humanity and its this journey that has been the focus of the past three generations of my family as weve been in east africa looking for the fossil remains of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past
and this is how we look for them
a group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly out across vast areas of africa looking for small fragments of bone fossil bone that may be on the surface
and thats an example of what we may do as we walk across the landscape in northern kenya looking for fossils
i doubt many of you in the audience can see the fossil thats in this picture but if you look very carefully there is a jaw a lower jaw of a million year old upright walking ape as it was found at lake turkana on the west side
its extremely time consuming labor intensive and it is something that is going to involve a lot more people to begin to piece together our past
we still really havent got a very complete picture of it
when we find a fossil we mark it
today weve got great technology we have gps
we mark it with a gps fix and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen so we could essentially put it back on the surface exactly where we found it
and we can bring all this information into big gis packages today
when we then find something very important like the bones of a human ancestor we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly using dental picks and fine paintbrushes
and all the sediment is then put through these screens and where we go again through it very carefully looking for small bone fragments and its then washed
and these things are so exciting they are so often the only or the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains
and heres a very special moment when my mother and myself were digging up some remains of human ancestors
and it is one of the most special things to ever do with your mother
not many people can say that
but now let me take you back to africa two million years ago
id just like to point out if you look at the map of africa it does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape
now were going to go to the east african and the rift valley
it essentially runs up from the gulf of aden or runs down to lake malawi
and the rift valley is a depression
its a basin and rivers flow down from the highlands into the basin carrying sediment preserving the bones of animals that lived there
if you want to become a fossil you actually need to die somewhere where your bones will be rapidly buried
you then hope that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface
and then you hope that one of us lot will walk around and find small pieces of you
ok so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much as we do know today about our ancestors because its incredibly difficult a for these things to become to be preserved and secondly for them to have been brought back up to the surface
and we really have only spent years looking for these remains and begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story
so lets go to lake turkana which is one such lake basin in the very north of our country kenya
and if you look north here theres a big river that flows into the lake thats been carrying sediment and preserving the remains of the animals that lived there
fossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin which represents some square miles
thats a huge job that weve got on our hands
two million years ago at lake turkana homo erectus one of our human ancestors actually lived in this region
you can see some of the major fossil sites that weve been working in the north but essentially two million years ago homo erectus up in the far right corner lived alongside three other species of human ancestor
and here is a skull of a homo erectus which i just pulled off the shelf there
but it is not to say that being a single species on planet earth is the norm
in fact if you go back in time it is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids or of human ancestors that coexist at any one time
where did these things come from
thats what were still trying to find answers to and it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species and our ancestors are no exception
heres some reconstructions of some of the fossils that have been found from lake turkana
but i was very lucky to have been brought up in kenya essentially accompanying my parents to lake turkana in search of human remains
and we were able to dig up when we got old enough fossils such as this a slender snouted crocodile
and we dug up giant tortoises and elephants and things like that
but when i was as i was in this picture a very exciting expedition was in place on the west side when they found essentially the skeleton of this homo erectus
i could relate to this homo erectus skeleton very well because i was the same age that he was when he died
and i imagined him to be tall dark skinned
his brothers certainly were able to run long distances chasing prey probably sweating heavily as they did so
he was very able to use stones effectively as tools
and this individual himself this one that im holding up here actually had a bad back hed probably had an injury as a child
he had a scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after quite carefully by other female and probably much smaller members of his family group to have got to where he did in life age
unfortunately for him he fell into a swamp and couldnt get out
essentially his bones were rapidly buried and beautifully preserved
and he remained there until million years later when this very famous fossil hunter kamoya kimeu walked along a small hillside and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface amongst the pebbles recognized it as being hominid
its actually this little piece up here on the top
well an excavation was begun immediately and more and more little bits of skull started to be extracted from the sediment
and what was so fun about it was this the skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree and fairly recently the tree had grown up but it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside and so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this holding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope
we began to find limb bones we found finger bones the bones of the pelvis vertebrae ribs the collar bones things that had never ever been seen before in homo erectus
it was truly exciting
he had a body very similar to our own and he was on the threshold of becoming human
well shortly afterwards members of his species started to move northwards out of africa and you start to see fossils of homo erectus in georgia china and also in parts of indonesia
so homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave africa and begin its spread across the globe
some exciting finds again as i mentioned from dmanisi in the republic of georgia
but also surprising finds recently announced from the island of flores in indonesia where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated and have become dwarfed and theyre only about a meter in height
but they lived only years ago and that is truly extraordinary to think about
just to put this in terms of generations because people do find it hard to think of time homo erectus left africa generations ago
we evolved essentially from an african stock
again at about years as a fully fledged us
and we only left africa about years ago
and until years ago at least three upright walking apes shared the planet earth
the question now is well who are we
were certainly a polluting wasteful aggressive species with a few nice things thrown in perhaps
for the most part were not particularly pleasant at all
we have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors
is this a good evolutionary adaptation or is it going to lead us to being the shortest lived hominid species on planet earth
and what is it that really makes us us
i think its our collective intelligence
its our ability to write things down our language and our consciousness
from very primitive beginnings with a very crude tool kit of stones we now have a very advanced tool kit and our tool use has really reached unprecedented levels weve got buggies to mars weve mapped the human genome and recently even created synthetic life thanks to craig venter
and weve also managed to communicate with people all over the world from extraordinary places
even from within an excavation in northern kenya we can talk to people about what were doing
as al gore so clearly has reminded us we have reached extraordinary numbers of people on this planet
human ancestors really only survive on planet earth if you look at the fossil record for about on average a million years at a time
weve only been around for the past years as a species yet weve reached a population of more than six and a half billion people
and last year our population grew by million
i mean these are extraordinary numbers
you can see here again taken from al gores book
but whats happened is our technology has removed the checks and balances on our population growth
we have to control our numbers and i think this is as important as anything else thats being done in the world today
but we have to control our numbers because we cant really hold it together as a species
my father so appropriately put it that we are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices that are bad for our survival as a species
can we hold it together
its important to remember that we all evolved in africa
we all have an african origin
we have a common past and we share a common future
evolutionarily speaking were just a blip
were sitting on the edge of a precipice and we have the tools and the technology at our hands to communicate what needs to be done to hold it together today
we could tell every single human being out there if we really wanted to
but will we do that or will we just let nature take its course
well to end on a very positive note i think evolutionarily speaking this is probably a fairly good thing in the end
ill leave it at that thank you very much

title dong woo jang the art of bow making title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript dong woo jang has an unusual after school hobby jang who was when he gave the talk tells the story of how living in the concrete jungle of seoul inspired him to build the perfect bow watch him demo one of his beautiful hand crafted archers bows description
it is said that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence and i believe this is true especially when i hear president obama often talk about the korean education system as a benchmark of success
well i can tell you that in the rigid structure and highly competitive nature of the korean school system also known as pressure cooker not everyone can do well in that environment
while many people responded in different ways about our education system my response to the high pressure environment was making bows with pieces of wood found near my apartment building
why bows
im not quite sure
perhaps in the face of constant pressure my caveman instinct of survival has connected with the bows
if you think about it the bow has really helped drive human survival since prehistoric times
the area within three kilometers of my home used to be a mulberry forest during the joseon dynasty where silkworms were fed with mulberry leaves
in order to raise the historical awareness of this fact the government has planted mulberry trees
the seeds from these trees also have spread by birds here and there nearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway that has been built around the olympics
the area near these walls which nobody bothers to pay attention to had been left free from major intervention and this is where i first found my treasures
as i fell deeper into bow making i began to search far and beyond my neighborhood
when i went on school field trips family vacations or simply on my way home from extracurricular classes i wandered around wooded areas and gathered tree branches with the tools that i sneaked inside my school bag
and they would be somethings like saws knives sickles and axes that i covered up with a piece of towel
i would bring the branches home riding buses and subways barely holding them in my hands
and i did not bring the tools here to long beach
airport security
in the privacy of my room covered in sawdust i would saw trim and polish wood all night long until a bow took shape
one day i was changing the shape of a bamboo piece and ended up setting the place on fire
where the rooftop of my apartment building a place where families call home
a customer from a department store across from my building called and i ran downstairs to tell my mom with half of my hair burned
i want to take this opportunity to tell my mom in the audience today mom i was really sorry and i will be more careful with open fire from now on
my mother had to do a lot of explaining telling people that her son did not commit a premeditated arson
i also researched extensively on bows around the world
in that process i tried to combine the different bows from across time and places to create the most effective bow
i also worked with many different types of wood such as maple yew and mulberry and did many shooting experiments in the wooded area near the urban expressway that i mentioned before
the most effective bow for me would be like this
one curved tips can maximize the springiness when you draw and shoot the arrow
two belly is drawn inward for higher draw weight which means more power
three sinew used in the outer layer of the limb for maximum tension storage
and four horn used to store energy in compression
after fixing breaking redesigning mending bending and amending my ideal bow began to take shape and when it was finally done it looked like this
i was so proud of myself for inventing a perfect bow on my own
this is a picture of korean traditional bows taken from a museum and see how my bow resembles them
thanks to my ancestors for robbing me of my invention
through bowmaking i came in contact with part of my heritage
learning the information that has accumulated over time and reading the message left by my ancestors were better than any consolation therapy or piece of advice any living adults could give me
you see i searched far and wide but never bothered to look close and near
from this realization i began to take interest in korean history which had never inspired me before
in the end the grass is often greener on my side of the fence although we dont realize it
now i am going to show you how my bow works
and lets see how this one works
this is a bamboo bow with pound draw weights
a bow may function in a simple mechanism but in order to make a good bow a great amount of sensitivity is required
you need to console and communicate with the wood material
each fiber in the wood has its own reason and function for being and only through cooperation and harmony among them comes a great bow
i may be an student with unconventional interests but i hope i am making a contribution by sharing my story with all of you
my ideal world is a place where no one is left behind where everyone is needed exactly where they are like the fibers and the tendons in a bow a place where the strong is flexible and the vulnerable is resilient
the bow resembles me and i resemble the bow
now i am shooting a part of myself to you
no better yet a part of my mind has just been shot over to your mind
did it strike you
thank you

title erin mckean the joy of lexicography title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript is the beloved paper dictionary doomed to extinction in this infectiously exuberant talk leading lexicographer erin mckean looks at the many ways todays print dictionary is poised for transformation description
now have any of yall ever looked up this word
you know in a dictionary yeah thats what i thought
how about this word
here ill show it to you
lexicography the practice of compiling dictionaries
notice were very specific that word compile
the dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite out of a lump of rock its made up of lots of little bits
its little discrete thats spelled d i s c r e t e bits
and those bits are words
now one of the perks of being a lexicographer besides getting to come to ted is that you get to say really fun words like lexicographical
lexicographical has this great pattern its called a double dactyl and just by saying double dactyl ive sent the geek needle all the way into the red
but lexicographical is the same pattern as higgledy piggledy
right its a fun word to say and i get to say it a lot
now one of the non perks of being a lexicographer is that people dont usually have a kind of warm fuzzy snuggly image of the dictionary
right nobody hugs their dictionaries
but what people really often think about the dictionary is they think more like this
just to let you know i do not have a lexicographical whistle
but people think that my job is to let the good words make that difficult left hand turn into the dictionary and keep the bad words out
but the thing is i dont want to be a traffic cop
for one thing i just do not do uniforms
and for another deciding what words are good and what words are bad is actually not very easy
and its not very fun and when parts of your job are not easy or fun you kind of look for an excuse not to do them
so if i had to think of some kind of occupation as a metaphor for my work i would much rather be a fisherman
i want to throw my big net into the deep blue ocean of english and see what marvelous creatures i can drag up from the bottom
but why do people want me to direct traffic when i would much rather go fishing
well i blame the queen
why do i blame the queen
well first of all i blame the queen because its funny
but secondly i blame the queen because dictionaries have really not changed
our idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign
the only thing that queen victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries is our inclusion of the f word which has happened in american dictionaries since
so theres this guy right victorian era
james murray first editor of the oxford english dictionary
i do not have that hat i wish i had that hat
so hes really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionaries today
when a guy who looks like that in that hat is the face of modernity you have a problem
and so james murray could get a job on any dictionary today
thered be virtually no learning curve
and of course a few of us are saying okay computers
computers what about computers
the thing about computers is i love computers
i mean im a huge geek i love computers
i would go on a hunger strike before i let them take away google book search from me
but computers dont do much else other than speed up the process of compiling dictionaries
they dont change the end result
because what a dictionary is is its victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion
its steampunk what we have is an electric velocipede
you know we have victorian design with an engine on it thats all
the design has not changed
and ok what about online dictionaries right
online dictionaries must be different
this is the oxford english dictionary online one of the best online dictionaries
this is my favorite word by the way
erinaceous pertaining to the hedgehog family of the nature of a hedgehog
very useful word so look at that
online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen
this is flat look how many links there are in the actual entry two
right those little buttons i had them all expanded except for the date chart
so theres not very much going on here
theres not a lot of clickiness
and in fact online dictionaries replicate almost all the problems of print except for searchability
and when you improve searchability you actually take away the one advantage of print which is serendipity
serendipity is when you find things you werent looking for because finding what you are looking for is so damned difficult
so now when you think about this what we have here is a ham butt problem
does everyone know the ham butt problem
womans making a ham for a big family dinner
she goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away and she looks at this piece of ham and shes like this is a perfectly good piece of ham why am i throwing this away
she thought well my mom always did this
so she calls up mom and she says mom whyd you cut the butt off the ham when youre making a ham
she says i dont know my mom always did it
so they call grandma and grandma says my pan was too small
so its not that we have good words and bad words
we have a pan thats too small
you know that ham butt is delicious theres no reason to throw it away
the bad words see when people think about a place and they dont find a place on the map they think this map sucks
when they find a nightspot or a bar and its not in the guidebook theyre like ooh this place must be cool its not in the guidebook
when they find a word thats not in the dictionary they think this must be a bad word why its more likely to be a bad dictionary
why are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan
so you cant get a smaller ham
the english language is as big as it is
so if you have a ham butt problem and youre thinking about the ham butt problem the conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive paper is the enemy of words
how can this be i mean i love books i really love books
some of my best friends are books
but the book is not the best shape for the dictionary
now theyre going to think oh boy
people are going to take away my beautiful paper dictionaries
no there will still be paper dictionaries
when we had cars when cars became the dominant mode of transportation we didnt round up all the horses and shoot them
you know therere still going to be paper dictionaries but its not going to be the dominant dictionary
the book shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape dictionaries come in and its not going to be the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in
so think about it this way if youve got an artificial constraint artificial constraints lead to arbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview
what if biologists could only study animals that made people go aww right
what if we made aesthetic judgments about animals and only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study
wed know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna and not very much about much else
and i think this is a problem
i think we should study all the words because when you think about words you can make beautiful expressions from very humble parts
lexicography is really more about material science
we are studying the tolerances of the materials that you use to build the structure of your expression your speeches and your writing and then often people say to me well ok how do i know that this word is real
they think ok if we think words are the tools that we use to build the expressions of our thoughts how can you say that screwdrivers are better than hammers
how can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball peen hammer
theyre just the right tools for the job
and so people say to me how do i know if a word is real
you know anybody whos read a childrens book knows that love makes things real
if you love a word use it that makes it real
being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction
it doesnt make a word any more real than any other way
if you love a word it becomes real
so if were not worrying about directing traffic if weve transcended paper if we are worrying less about control and more about description then we can think of the english language as being this beautiful mobile
and any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes is touched any time you touch a word you use it in a new context you give it a new connotation you verb it you make the mobile move
you didnt break it its just in a new position and that new position can be just as beautiful
now if youre no longer a traffic cop the problem with being a traffic cop is there can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection or the cars get confused right
but if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic but maybe to count the cars that go by then more eyeballs are better
you can ask for help
if you ask for help you get more done and we really need help
library of congress million books of which half are in english
if only one out of every of those books had a word thats not in the dictionary in it that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries
and i find an un dictionaried word a word like un dictionaried for example in almost every book i read what about newspapers
newspaper archive goes back to million newspaper pages if only one in of those pages had an un dictionaried word on it it would be an entire other oed
thats more words so thats a lot
and im not even talking about magazines im not talking about blogs and i find more new words on boingboing in a given week than i do newsweek or time
theres a lot going on there
and im not even talking about polysemy which is the greedy habit some words have of taking so if you think of the word set a set can be a badgers burrow a set can be one of the pleats in an elizabethan ruff and theres one numbered definition in the oed
the oed has different numbered definitions for set
tiny little word numbered definitions
one of them is just labeled miscellaneous technical senses
do you know what that says to me
that says to me it was friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub
thats a lexicographical cop out to say miscellaneous technical senses
so we have all these words and we really need help
and the thing is we could ask for help asking for helps not that hard
i mean lexicography is not rocket science
see i just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers and this is more of a visual explanation
if we think of the dictionary as being the map of the english language these bright spots are what we know about and the dark spots are where we are in the dark
if that was the map of all the words in american english we dont know very much
and we dont even know the shape of the language
if this was the dictionary if this was the map of american english look we have a kind of lumpy idea of florida but theres no california
were missing california from american english
we just dont know enough and we dont even know that were missing california
we dont even see that theres a gap on the map
so again lexicography is not rocket science
but even if it were rocket science is being done by dedicated amateurs these days you know
it cant be that hard to find some words
so enough scientists in other disciplines are really asking people to help and theyre doing a good job of it
for instance theres ebird where amateur birdwatchers can upload information about their bird sightings
and then ornithologists can go and help track populations migrations etc
and theres this guy mike oates mike oates lives in the u k
hes a director of an electroplating company
hes found more than comets
hes found so many comets they named a comet after him
its kind of out past mars its a hike
i dont think hes getting his picture taken there anytime soon
but he found comets without a telescope
he downloaded data from the nasa soho satellite and thats how he found them
if we can find comets without a telescope shouldnt we be able to find words
now yall know where im going with this
because im going to the internet which is where everybody goes
and the internet is great for collecting words because the internets full of collectors
and this is a little known technological fact about the internet but the internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm
and words and enthusiasm actually happen to be the recipe for lexicography isnt that great
so there are a lot of really good word collecting sites out there right now but the problem with some of them is that theyre not scientific enough
they show the word but they dont show any context
where did it come from who said it
what newspaper was it in what book
because a word is like an archaeological artifact
if you dont know the provenance or the source of the artifact its not science its a pretty thing to look at
so a word without its source is like a cut flower
you know its pretty to look at for a while but then it dies
it dies too fast
so this whole time ive been saying the dictionary the dictionary the dictionary the dictionary
not a dictionary or dictionaries and thats because well people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language
they use it synecdochically
and one of the problems of knowing a word like synecdochically is that you really want an excuse to say synecdochically
this whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point where i could say synecdochically to all of you
so im really sorry but when you use a part of something like the dictionary is a part of the language or a flag stands for the united states its a symbol of the country then youre using it synecdochically
but the thing is we could make the dictionary the whole language
if we get a bigger pan then we can put all the words in
we can put in all the meanings
doesnt everyone want more meaning in their lives
and we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language we can make it be the whole language
you see what im really hoping for is that my son who turns seven this month i want him to barely remember that this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in
this is what dictionaries used to look like
i want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eight track tape
its a format that died because it wasnt useful enough
it wasnt really what people needed
and the thing is if we can put in all the words no longer have that artificial distinction between good and bad we can really describe the language like scientists
we can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers
if we can do that then i can spend all my time fishing and i dont have to be a traffic cop anymore
thank you very much for your kind attention

title angela belcher using nature to grow batteries title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript inspired by an abalone shell angela belcher programs viruses to make elegant nanoscale structures that humans can use selecting for high performing genes through directed evolution shes produced viruses that can construct powerful new batteries clean hydrogen fuels and record breaking solar cells in her talk she shows us how its done description
i thought i would talk a little bit about how nature makes materials
i brought along with me an abalone shell
this abalone shell is a biocomposite material thats percent by mass calcium carbonate and two percent by mass protein
yet its times tougher than its geological counterpart
and a lot of people might use structures like abalone shells like chalk
ive been fascinated by how nature makes materials and theres a lot of sequence to how they do such an exquisite job
part of it is that these materials are macroscopic in structure but theyre formed at the nanoscale
theyre formed at the nanoscale and they use proteins that are coded by the genetic level that allow them to build these really exquisite structures
so something i think is very fascinating is what if you could give life to non living structures like batteries and like solar cells
what if they had some of the same capabilities that an abalone shell did in terms of being able to build really exquisite structures at room temperature and room pressure using non toxic chemicals and adding no toxic materials back into the environment
so thats the vision that ive been thinking about
and so what if you could grow a battery in a petri dish
or what if you could give genetic information to a battery so that it could actually become better as a function of time and do so in an environmentally friendly way
and so going back to this abalone shell besides being nano structured one thing thats fascinating is when a male and a female abalone get together they pass on the genetic information that says this is how to build an exquisite material
heres how to do it at room temperature and pressure using non toxic materials
same with diatoms which are shown right here which are glasseous structures
every time the diatoms replicate they give the genetic information that says heres how to build glass in the ocean thats perfectly nano structured
and you can do it the same over and over again
so what if you could do the same thing with a solar cell or a battery
i like to say my favorite biomaterial is my four year old
but anyone whos ever had or knows small children knows theyre incredibly complex organisms
and so if you wanted to convince them to do something they dont want to do its very difficult
so when we think about future technologies we actually think of using bacteria and virus simple organisms
can you convince them to work with a new toolbox so that they can build a structure that will be important to me
also when we think about future technologies we start with the beginning of earth
basically it took a billion years to have life on earth
and very rapidly they became multi cellular they could replicate they could use photosynthesis as a way of getting their energy source
but it wasnt until about million years ago during the cambrian geologic time period that organisms in the ocean started making hard materials
before that they were all soft fluffy structures
and it was during this time that there was increased calcium and iron and silicon in the environment and organisms learned how to make hard materials
and so thats what i would like be able to do convince biology to work with the rest of the periodic table
now if you look at biology theres many structures like dna and antibodies and proteins and ribosomes that youve heard about that are already nano structured
so nature already gives us really exquisite structures on the nanoscale
what if we could harness them and convince them to not be an antibody that does something like hiv
but what if we could convince them to build a solar cell for us
so here are some examples these are some natural shells
there are natural biological materials
the abalone shell here and if you fracture it you can look at the fact that its nano structured
theres diatoms made out of and theyre magnetotactic bacteria that make small single domain magnets used for navigation
what all these have in common is these materials are structured at the nanoscale and they have a dna sequence that codes for a protein sequence that gives them the blueprint to be able to build these really wonderful structures
now going back to the abalone shell the abalone makes this shell by having these proteins
these proteins are very negatively charged
and they can pull calcium out of the environment put down a layer of calcium and then carbonate calcium and carbonate
it has the chemical sequences of amino acids which says this is how to build the structure
heres the dna sequence heres the protein sequence in order to do it
and so an interesting idea is what if you could take any material that you wanted or any element on the periodic table and find its corresponding dna sequence then code it for a corresponding protein sequence to build a structure but not build an abalone shell build something that through nature it has never had the opportunity to work with yet
and so heres the periodic table
and i absolutely love the periodic table
every year for the incoming freshman class at mit i have a periodic table made that says welcome to mit now youre in your element
and you flip it over and its the amino acids with the ph at which they have different charges
and so i give this out to thousands of people
and i know it says mit and this is caltech but i have a couple extra if people want it
and i was really fortunate to have president obama visit my lab this year on his visit to mit and i really wanted to give him a periodic table
so i stayed up at night and i talked to my husband how do i give president obama a periodic table
what if he says oh i already have one or ive already memorized it
and so he came to visit my lab and looked around it was a great visit
and then afterward i said sir i want to give you the periodic table in case youre ever in a bind and need to calculate molecular weight
and i thought molecular weight sounded much less nerdy than molar mass
and so he looked at it and he said thank you ill look at it periodically
and later in a lecture that he gave on clean energy he pulled it out and said and people at mit they give out periodic tables
so basically what i didnt tell you is that about million years ago organisms starter making materials but it took them about million years to get good at it
it took them about million years to learn how to perfect how to make that abalone shell
and thats a hard sell to a graduate student
i have this great project million years
and so we had to develop a way of trying to do this more rapidly
and so we use a virus thats a non toxic virus called bacteriophage thats job is to infect bacteria
well it has a simple dna structure that you can go in and cut and paste additional dna sequences into it
and by doing that it allows the virus to express random protein sequences
and this is pretty easy biotechnology
and you could basically do this a billion times
and so you can go in and have a billion different viruses that are all genetically identical but they differ from each other based on their tips on one sequence that codes for one protein
now if you take all billion viruses and you can put them in one drop of liquid you can force them to interact with anything you want on the periodic table
and through a process of selection evolution you can pull one out of a billion that does something that youd like it to do like grow a battery or grow a solar cell
so basically viruses cant replicate themselves they need a host
once you find that one out of a billion you infect it into a bacteria and you make millions and billions of copies of that particular sequence
and so the other thing thats beautiful about biology is that biology gives you really exquisite structures with nice link scales
and these viruses are long and skinny and we can get them to express the ability to grow something like semiconductors or materials for batteries
now this is a high powered battery that we grew in my lab
we engineered a virus to pick up carbon nanotubes
so one part of the virus grabs a carbon nanotube
the other part of the virus has a sequence that can grow an electrode material for a battery
and then it wires itself to the current collector
and so through a process of selection evolution we went from being able to have a virus that made a crummy battery to a virus that made a good battery to a virus that made a record breaking high powered battery thats all made at room temperature basically at the bench top
and that battery went to the white house for a press conference
i brought it here
you can see it in this case thats lighting this led
now if we could scale this you could actually use it to run your prius which is my dream to be able to drive a virus powered car
but its basically you can pull one out of a billion
you can make lots of amplifications to it
basically you make an amplification in the lab and then you get it to self assemble into a structure like a battery
were able to do this also with catalysis
this is the example of photocatalytic splitting of water
and what weve been able to do is engineer a virus to basically take dye absorbing molecules and line them up on the surface of the virus so it acts as an antenna and you get an energy transfer across the virus
and then we give it a second gene to grow an inorganic material that can be used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen that can be used for clean fuels
and i brought an example with me of that today
my students promised me it would work
these are virus assembled nanowires
when you shine light on them you can see them bubbling
in this case youre seeing oxygen bubbles come out
and basically by controlling the genes you can control multiple materials to improve your device performance
the last example are solar cells
you can also do this with solar cells
weve been able to engineer viruses to pick up carbon nanotubes and then grow titanium dioxide around them and use as a way of getting electrons through the device
and what weve found is through genetic engineering we can actually increase the efficiencies of these solar cells to record numbers for these types of dye sensitized systems
and i brought one of those as well that you can play around with outside afterward
so this is a virus based solar cell
through evolution and selection we took it from an eight percent efficiency solar cell to an percent efficiency solar cell
so i hope that ive convinced you that theres a lot of great interesting things to be learned about how nature makes materials and taking it the next step to see if you can force or whether you can take advantage of how nature makes materials to make things that nature hasnt yet dreamed of making
thank you

title stefan sagmeister happiness by design title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript graphic designer stefan sagmeister takes the audience on a whimsical journey through moments of his life that made him happy and notes how many of these moments have to do with good design description
about years ago i went to visit a friend in hong kong
and at the time i was very superstitious
so upon landing this was still at the old hong kong airport thats kai tak when it was smack in the middle of the city i thought if i see something good im going to have a great time here in my two weeks and if i see something negative im going to be miserable indeed
so the plane landed in between the buildings and got to a full stop in front of this little billboard
and i actually went to see some of the design companies in hong kong in my stay there
and it turned out that i just went to see you know what they are doing in hong kong
but i actually walked away with a great job offer
and i flew back to austria packed my bags and another week later i was again on my way to hong kong still superstitions and thinking well if that winner billboard is still up im going to have a good time working here
but if its gone its going to be really miserable and stressful
so it turned out that not only was the billboard still up but they had put this one right next to it
on the other hand it also taught me where superstition gets me because i really had a terrible time in hong kong
however i did have a number of real moments of happiness in my life of you know i think what the conference brochure refers to as moments that take your breath away
and since im a big list maker i actually listed them all
now you dont have to go through the trouble of reading them and i wont read them for you
i know that its incredibly boring to hear about other peoples happinesses
what i did do though is i actually looked at them from a design standpoint and just eliminated all the ones that had nothing to do with design
and very surprisingly over half of them had actually something to do with design
so there are of course two different possibilities
theres one from a consumers point of view where i was happy while experiencing design
and ill just give you one example i had gotten my first walkman
this is
my brother had this great yamaha motorcycle that he was willing to borrow to me freely
and the polices synchronicity cassette had just been released and there was no helmet law in my hometown of bregenz
so you could drive up into the mountains freely blasting the police on the new sony walkman
and i remember it as a true moment of happiness
you know of course they are related to this combination of at least two of them being you know design objects
and you know theres a scale of happiness when you talk about in design but the motorcycle incident would definitely be you know situated somewhere here right in there between delight and bliss
now there is the other part from a designers standpoint if youre happy while actually doing it
and one way to see how happy designers are when theyre designing could be to look at the authors photos on the back of their monographs
so according to this the australians and the japanese as well as the mexicans are very happy
while somewhat the spaniards
and i think particularly the swiss dont seem to be doing all that well
last november a museum opened in tokyo called the mori museum in a skyscraper up on the floor
and their inaugural exhibit was called happiness
and i went very eagerly to see it because well also with an eye on this conference
and they interestingly sectioned the exhibit off into four different areas
under arcadia they showed things like this from the edo period a hundred ways to write happiness in different forms
or they had this apple by yoko ono that of course later on was you know made into the label for the beatles
under nirvana they showed this constable painting
and there was a little an interesting theory about abstraction
this is a blue field its actually an yves klein painting
and the theory was that if you abstract an image you really you know open as much room for the un representable and therefore you know are able to involve the viewer more
then under desire they showed these shunsho paintings also from the edo period ink on silk
and lastly under harmony they had this century mandala from tibet
now what i took away from the exhibit was that maybe with the exception of the mandala most of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness and not about happiness
and i felt a little bit cheated because the visualization thats a really easy thing to do
and you know my studio weve done it all the time
this is you know a book
a happy dog and you take it out its an aggressive dog
its a happy david byrne and an angry david byrne
or a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face
you know thats not a big deal to accomplish
it has gotten to the point where you know within advertising or within the movie industry happy has gotten such a bad reputation that if you actually want to do something with the subject and still appear authentic you almost would have to you know do it from a cynical point of view
this is you know the movie poster
or we a couple of weeks ago designed a box set for the talking heads where the happiness visualized on the cover definitely has very much a dark side to it
much much more difficult is this where the designs actually can evoke happiness and im going to just show you three that actually did this for me
this is a campaign done by a young artist in new york who calls himself true
everybody who has ridden the new york subway system will be familiar with these signs
true printed his own version of these signs
met every wednesday at a subway stop with of his friends
they divided up the different subway lines and added their own version
so this is one
now the way this works in the system is that nobody ever looks at these signs
so youre youre really bored in the subway and you kind of stare at something
and it takes you a while until it actually you realize that this says something different than what it normally says
i mean thats at least how it made me happy
now true is a real humanitarian
he didnt want any of his friends to be arrested so he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card
and also gave this fake letter from the mta to everybody sort of like pretending that its an art project financed by the metropolitan transit authority
another new york project
this is at p s a sculpture thats basically a square room by james turrell that has a retractable ceiling
opens up at dusk and dawn every day
you dont see the horizon
youre just in there watching the incredible subtle changes of color in the sky
and the room is truly something to be seen
peoples demeanor changes when they go in there
and for sure i havent looked at the sky in the same way after spending an hour in there
there are of course more than those three projects that im showing here
i would definitely say that observing vik muniz cloud a couple of years ago in manhattan for sure made me happy as well
but my last project is again from a young designer in new york
hes from korea originally
and he took it upon himself to print speech bubbles empty speech bubbles stickers large ones and small ones
and he goes around new york and just puts them empty as they are on posters
and other people go and fill them in
this one says please let me die in peace
i think that was the most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good
this is on a musician poster that says i am concerned that my cd will not sell more than units and that as a result my recoupable advance from my label will be taken from me after which my contract will be cancelled and ill be back doing journey covers on bleecker street
i think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved wins
jee gets to have his project the public gets a sweeter environment and different public gets a place to express itself and the advertisers finally get somebody to look at their ads
well there was a question of course that was on my mind for a while you know can i do more of the things that i like doing in design and less of the ones that i dont like to be doing
which brought me back to my list making you know just to see what i actually like about my job
you know one is just working without pressure
then working concentrated without being frazzled
or as nancy said before like really immerse oneself into it
try not to get stuck doing the same thing or try not get stuck behind the computer all day
this is you know related to it getting out of the studio
then of course trying to you know work on things where the content is actually important for me
and being able to enjoy the end results
and then i found another list in one of my diaries that actually contained all the things that i thought i learned in my life so far
and just about at that time an austrian magazine called and asked if we would want to do six spreads design six spreads that work like dividing pages between the different chapters in the magazine
and the whole thing just fell together
so i just picked one of the things that i thought i learned in this case everything i do always comes back to me and we made these spreads right out of this
so it was everything i do always comes back to me
a couple of weeks ago a french company asked us to design five billboards for them
again we could supply the content for it
so i just picked another one
and this was two weeks ago
we flew to arizona the designer who works with me and myself and photographed this one
so its trying to look good limits my life
and then we did one more of these
this is again for a magazine dividing pages
this is having this is the same thing its just you know photographed from the side
this is from the front
then its guts
again its the same thing guts is just the same room reworked
then its always works out
then its for with the light on
and its me
thank you so much

title peter diamandis stephen hawkings zero g flight title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript x prize founder peter diamandis talks about how he helped stephen hawking fulfill his dream of going to space by flying together into the upper atmosphere and experiencing weightlessness at zero g description
those of you who know me know how passionate i am about opening the space frontier
so when i had the chance to give the worlds expert in gravity the experience of zero gravity it was incredible
and i want to tell you that story
i first met him through the archon x prize for genomics
its a competition were holding the second x prize for the first team to sequence human genomes in days
we have something called the genome individuals were sequencing as part of that
craig venter chairs that event
and i met professor hawking and he said his dream was to travel into space
and i said i cant take you there but i can take you into weightlessness into zero g
and he said on the spot absolutely yes
well the only way to experience zero g on earth is actually with parabolic flight weightless flight
you take an airplane you fly over the top youre weightless for seconds
come back down you weigh twice as much
you can get eight minutes of weightlessness how nasas trained their astronauts for so long
we set out to do this
it took us years to become operational
and we announced that we were going to fly stephen hawking
we had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say youre crazy dont do that youre going kill the guy
and he wanted to go
we worked hard to get all the permissions
and six months later we sat down at kennedy space center
we had a press conference we announced our intent to do one zero g parabola give him seconds of zero g
and if it went really well we might do three parabolas
well we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this
and what he said for me was very moving
he said life on earth is at an ever increasing risk of being wiped out by disaster
i think the human race doesnt have a future if it doesnt go into space
i therefore want to encourage public interest in space
we took him out to the kennedy space center up inside the nasa vehicle into the back of the zero g airplane
we had about people who made donations we raised in donations for childrens charities who flew with us
a few tedsters here
we set up a whole er
we had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane
we were monitoring his of his blood his heart rate his blood pressure
we had everything all set in case of an emergency god knows you dont want to hurt this world renowned expert
we took off from the shuttle landing facility where the shuttle takes off and lands
and my partner byron lichtenberg and i carefully suspended him into zero g
once he was there let him go to experience what weightlessness was truly like
and after that first parabola you know the doc said everything is great he was smiling and we said go
so we did a second parabola
and a third
we actually floated an apple in homage to sir isaac newton because professor hawking holds the same chair at cambridge that isaac newton did
and we did a fourth and a fifth and a sixth
and a seventh and an eighth
and this man does not look like a year old wheelchair bound man
he was so happy
we are living on a precious jewel and its during our lifetime that were moving off this planet
please join us in this epic adventure
thank you so much

title matt killingsworth want to be happier stay in the moment title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript when are humans most happy to gather data on this question matt killingsworth built an app track your happiness that let people report their feelings in real time among the surprising results were often happiest when were lost in the moment and the flip side the more our mind wanders the less happy we can be description
so people want a lot of things out of life but i think more than anything else they want happiness
aristotle called happiness the chief good the end towards which all other things aim
according to this view the reason we want a big house or a nice car or a good job isnt that these things are intrinsically valuable
its that we expect them to bring us happiness
now in the last years we americans have gotten a lot of the things that we want were richer
we live longer we have access to technology that would have seemed like science fiction just a few years ago
the paradox of happiness is that even though the objective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically we havent actually gotten any happier
maybe because these conventional notions of progress havent delivered big benefits in terms of happiness theres been an increased interest in recent years in happiness itself
people have been debating the causes of happiness for a really long time in fact for thousands of years but it seems like many of those debates remain unresolved
well as with many other domains in life i think the scientific method has the potential to answer this question
in fact in the last few years theres been an explosion in research on happiness for example weve learned a lot about its demographics how things like income and education gender and marriage relate to it
but one of the puzzles this has revealed is that factors like these dont seem to have a particularly strong effect
yes its better to make more money rather than less or to graduate from college instead of dropping out but the differences in happiness tend to be small
which leaves the question what are the big causes of happiness
i think thats a question we havent really answered yet but i think something that has the potential to be an answer is that maybe happiness has an awful lot to do with the contents of our moment to moment experiences
it certainly seems that were going about our lives that what were doing who were with what were thinking about have a big influence on our happiness and yet these are the very factors that have been very difficult in fact almost impossible for scientists to study
a few years ago i came up with a way to study peoples happiness moment to moment as theyre going about their daily lives on a massive scale all over the world something wed never been able to do before called trackyourhappiness org it uses the iphone to monitor peoples happiness in real time
how does this work basically i send people signals at random points throughout the day and then i ask them a bunch of questions about their moment to moment experience at the instant just before the signal
the idea is that if we can watch how peoples happiness goes up and down over the course of the day minute to minute in some cases and try to understand how what people are doing who theyre with what theyre thinking about and all the other factors that describe our day how those might relate to those changes in happiness we might be able to discover some of the things that really have a big influence on happiness
weve been fortunate with this project to collect quite a lot of data a lot more data of this kind than i think has ever been collected before over real time reports from over people
and its not just a lot of people its a really diverse group people from a wide range of ages from to late a wide range of incomes education levels people who are married divorced widowed etc
they collectively represent every one of occupational categories and hail from over countries
what id like to do with the rest of my time with you today is talk a little bit about one of the areas that weve been investigating and thats mind wandering
as human beings we have this unique ability to have our minds stray away from the present
this guy is sitting here working on his computer and yet he could be thinking about the vacation he had last month wondering what hes going to have for dinner
maybe hes worried that hes going bald
this ability to focus our attention on something other than the present is really amazing it allows us to learn and plan and reason in ways that no other species of animal can
and yet its not clear what the relationship is between our use of this ability and our happiness
youve probably heard people suggest that you should stay focused on the present be here now youve probably heard a hundred times
maybe to really be happy we need to stay completely immersed and focused on our experience in the moment
maybe these people are right maybe mind wandering is a bad thing
on the other hand when our minds wander theyre unconstrained we cant change the physical reality in front of us but we can go anywhere in our minds
since we know people want to be happy maybe when our minds wander theyre going to someplace happier than the place that theyre leaving it would make a lot of sense
in other words maybe the pleasures of the mind allow us to increase our happiness with mind wandering
well since im a scientist id like to try to resolve this debate with some data and in particular id like to present some data to you from three questions that i ask with track your happiness remember this is from sort of moment to moment experience in peoples real lives
there are three questions the first one is a happiness question how do you feel on a scale ranging from very bad to very good second an activity question what are you doing on a list of different activities including things like eating and working and watching tv
and finally a mind wandering question are you thinking about something other than what youre currently doing
people could say no in other words im focused only on my task or yes i am thinking about something else and the topic of those thoughts are pleasant neutral or unpleasant
any of those yes responses are what we called mind wandering
so what did we find
this graph shows happiness on the vertical axis and you can see that bar there representing how happy people are when theyre focused on the present when theyre not mind wandering
as it turns out people are substantially less happy when their minds are wandering than when theyre not
now you might look at this result and say okay sure on average people are less happy when theyre mind wandering but surely when their minds are straying away from something that wasnt very enjoyable to begin with at least then mind wandering should be doing something good for us
nope as it turns out people are less happy when theyre mind wandering no matter what theyre doing for example people dont really like commuting to work very much
its one of their least enjoyable activities and yet they are substantially happier when theyre focused only on their commute than when their mind is going off to something else
its amazing
so how could this be happening i think part of the reason a big part of the reason is that when our minds wander we often think about unpleasant things and they are enormously less happy when they do that our worries our anxieties our regrets and yet even when people are thinking about something neutral theyre still considerably less happy than when theyre not mind wandering at all
even when theyre thinking about something they would describe as pleasant theyre actually just slightly less happy than when they arent mind wandering
if mind wandering were a slot machine it would be like having the chance to lose dollars dollars or one dollar right youd never want to play
so ive been talking about this suggesting perhaps that mind wandering causes unhappiness but all ive really shown you is that these two things are correlated
its possible thats the case but it might also be the case that when people are unhappy then they mind wander
maybe thats whats really going on how could we ever disentangle these two possibilites
well one fact that we can take advantage of i think a fact youll all agree is true is that time goes forward not backward right the cause has to come before the effect
were lucky in this data we have many responses from each person and so we can look and see does mind wandering tend to precede unhappiness or does unhappiness tend to precede mind wandering to get some insight into the causal direction
as it turns out there is a strong relationship between mind wandering now and being unhappy a short time later consistent with the idea that mind wandering is causing people to be unhappy
in contrast theres no relationship between being unhappy now and mind wandering a short time later
in other words mind wandering very likely seems to be an actual cause and not merely a consequence of unhappiness
a few minutes ago i likened mind wandering to a slot machine youd never want to play
well how often do peoples minds wander
turns out they wander a lot in fact really a lot
forty seven percent of the time people are thinking about something other than what theyre currently doing
how does that depend on what people are doing
this shows the rate of mind wandering across activities ranging from a high of percent when people are taking a shower brushing their teeth to percent when theyre working to percent when theyre exercising all the way down to this one short bar on the right that i think some of you are probably laughing at
ten percent of the time peoples minds are wandering when theyre having sex
but theres something i think thats quite interesting in this graph and that is basically with one exception no matter what people are doing theyre mind wandering at least percent of the time which suggests i think that mind wandering isnt just frequent its ubiquitous
it pervades basically everything that we do
in my talk today ive told you a little bit about mind wandering a variable that i think turns out to be fairly important in the equation for happiness
my hope is that over time by tracking peoples moment to moment happiness and their experiences in daily life well be able to uncover a lot of important causes of happiness and then in the end a scientific understanding of happiness will help us create a future thats not only richer and healthier but happier as well
thank you

title joshua silver adjustable liquid filled eyeglasses title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript josh silver delivers his brilliantly simple solution for correcting vision at the lowest cost possible adjustable liquid filled lenses at tedglobal he demos his affordable eyeglasses and reveals his global plan to distribute them to a billion people in need by description
im going to tell you about one of the worlds largest problems and how it can be solved
id like to start with a little experiment
could you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses or youve had laser refractive surgery
now unfortunately there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly
but it looks like im guessing that itll be about percent of the room because thats roughly the fraction of developed world population that have some sort of vision correction
the world health organization estimates well they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses the lowest estimate is million people
they also have an estimate of around a billion
but in fact i would argue that weve just done an experiment here and now which shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear is around half of any population
and the problem of poor vision is actually not just a health problem its also an educational problem and its an economic problem and its a quality of life problem
glasses are not very expensive theyre quite plentiful
the problem is there arent enough eye care professionals in the world to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear that we have in the developed world
there are just way too few eye care professionals
so this little slide here shows you an optometrist and the little blue person represents about people and thats the ratio in the u k
this is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub saharan africa
in fact there are some countries in sub saharan africa where theres one optometrist for eight million of the population
how do you do this how do you solve this problem
i came up with a solution to this problem and i came up with a solution based on adaptive optics for this
and the idea is you make eye glasses and you adjust them yourself and that solves the problem
what i want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses
i shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses i shall pop this in my pocket
im short sighted i look at the signs at the end i can hardly see them
so okay i can now see that man running out there and i can see that guy running out there
ive now made prescription eyewear to my prescription
next step in my process
so ive now made eye glasses to my prescription
okay so ive made these glasses and
okay ive made the glasses to my prescription and
ive just
and ive now made some glasses thats it
now these arent the only pair in the world
in fact this technologys been evolving
i started working on it in and its been evolving very slowly
there are about in use now
and theyre in fifteen countries theyre spread around the world
and i have a vision which ill share with you
i have a global vision for vision
and that vision is to try to get a billion people wearing the glasses they need by the year
to do that this is an early example of the technology
the technology is being further developed the cost has to be brought down
this pair in fact these currently cost about dollars
but the cost has to be brought right down
it has to be brought down because were trying to serve populations who live on a dollar a day
how do you solve this problem
you start to get into detail
and on this slide im basically explaining all the problems you have
how do you distribute how do you work out how to fit the thing
how do you have people realizing that they have a vision problem
how do you deal with the industry
and the answer to that is research
what weve done is to set up the center for vision in the developing world here in the university

title janet iwasa how animations can help scientists test a hypothesis title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript animation can bring scientific hypotheses to life molecular biologist janet iwasa introduces a new open source animation software designed just for scientists description
take a look at this drawing
can you tell what it is
im a molecular biologist by training and ive seen a lot of these kinds of drawings
theyre usually referred to as a model figure a drawing that shows how we think a cellular or molecular process occurs
this particular drawing is of a process called clathrin mediated endocytosis
its a process by which a molecule can get from the outside of the cell to the inside by getting captured in a bubble or a vesicle that then gets internalized by the cell
theres a problem with this drawing though and its mainly in what it doesnt show
from lots of experiments from lots of different scientists we know a lot about what these molecules look like how they move around in the cell and that this is all taking place in an incredibly dynamic environment
so in collaboration with a clathrin expert tomas kirchhausen we decided to create a new kind of model figure that showed all of that
so we start outside of the cell
now were looking inside
clathrin are these three legged molecules that can self assemble into soccer ball like shapes
through connections with a membrane clathrin is able to deform the membrane and form this sort of a cup that forms this sort of a bubble or a vesicle thats now capturing some of the proteins that were outside of the cell
proteins are coming in now that basically pinch off this vesicle making it separate from the rest of the membrane and now clathrin is basically done with its job and so proteins are coming in now weve covered them yellow and orange that are responsible for taking apart this clathrin cage
and so all of these proteins can get basically recycled and used all over again
these processes are too small to be seen directly even with the best microscopes so animations like this provide a really powerful way of visualizing a hypothesis
heres another illustration and this is a drawing of how a researcher might think that the hiv virus gets into and out of cells
and again this is a vast oversimplification and doesnt begin to show what we actually know about these processes
you might be surprised to know that these simple drawings are the only way that most biologists visualize their molecular hypotheses
why
because creating movies of processes as we think they actually occur is really hard
i spent months in hollywood learning animation software and i spend months on each animation and thats just time that most researchers cant afford
the payoffs can be huge though
molecular animations are unparalleled in their ability to convey a great deal of information to broad audiences with extreme accuracy
and im working on a new project now called the science of hiv where ill be animating the entire life cycle of the hiv virus as accurately as possible and all in molecular detail
the animation will feature data from thousands of researchers collected over decades data on what this virus looks like how its able to infect cells in our body and how therapeutics are helping to combat infection
over the years i found that animations arent just useful for communicating an idea but theyre also really useful for exploring a hypothesis
biologists for the most part are still using a paper and pencil to visualize the processes they study and with the data we have now thats just not good enough anymore
the process of creating an animation can act as a catalyst that allows researchers to crystalize and refine their own ideas
one researcher i worked with who works on the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases came up with experiments that were related directly to the animation that she and i worked on together and in this way animation can feed back into the research process
i believe that animation can change biology
it can change the way that we communicate with one another how we explore our data and how we teach our students
but for that change to happen we need more researchers creating animations and toward that end i brought together a team of biologists animators and programmers to create a new free open source software we call it molecular flipbook thats created just for biologists just to create molecular animations
from our testing weve found that it only takes minutes for a biologist who has never touched animation software before to create her first molecular animation of her own hypothesis
were also building an online database where anyone can view download and contribute their own animations
were really excited to announce that the beta version of the molecular animation software toolkit will be available for download today
we are really excited to see what biologists will create with it and what new insights theyre able to gain from finally being able to animate their own model figures

title julia bacha pay attention to nonviolence title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript in the palestinian village of budrus mounted a month long nonviolent protest to stop a barrier being built across their olive groves did you hear about it didnt think so brazilian filmmaker julia bacha asks why we only pay attention to violence in the israel palestine conflict and not to the nonviolent leaders who may one day bring peace description
im a filmmaker
for the last years i have dedicated my life to documenting the work of israelis and palestinians who are trying to end the conflict using peaceful means
when i travel with my work across europe and the united states one question always comes up where is the palestinian gandhi
why arent palestinians using nonviolent resistance
the challenge i face when i hear this question is that often i have just returned from the middle east where i spent my time filming dozens of palestinians who are using nonviolence to defend their lands and water resources from israeli soldiers and settlers
these leaders are trying to forge a massive national nonviolent movement to end the occupation and build peace in the region
yet most of you have probably never heard about them
this divide between whats happening on the ground and perceptions abroad is one of the key reasons why we dont have yet a palestinian peaceful resistance movement that has been successful
so im here today to talk about the power of attention the power of your attention and the emergence and development of nonviolent movements in the west bank gaza and elsewhere but today my case study is going to be palestine
i believe that whats mostly missing for nonviolence to grow is not for palestinians to start adopting nonviolence but for us to start paying attention to those who already are
allow me to illustrate this point by taking you to this village called budrus
about seven years ago they faced extinction because israel announced it would build a separation barrier and part of this barrier would be built on top of the village
they would lose percent of their land and be surrounded so they would lose free access to the rest of the west bank
through inspired local leadership they launched a peaceful resistance campaign to stop that from happening
let me show you some brief clips so you have a sense for what that actually looked like on the ground
palestinian woman we were told the wall would separate palestine from israel
here in budrus we realized the wall would steal our land
israeli man the fence has in fact created a solution to terror
man today youre invited to a peaceful march
you are joined by dozens of your israeli brothers and sisters
israeli activist nothing scares the army more than nonviolent opposition
woman we saw the men trying to push the soldiers but none of them could do that
but i think the girls could do it
fatah party member we must empty our minds of traditional thinking
hamas party member we were in complete harmony and we wanted to spread it to all of palestine
chanting one united nation
fatah hamas and the popular front
news anchor the clashes over the fence continue
reporter israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd
they were allowed to use any force necessary
man these are live bullets
its like fallujah shooting everywhere
israeli activist i was sure we were all going to die
but there were others around me who werent even cowering
israeli soldier a nonviolent protest is not going to stop the
protester this is a peaceful march
there is no need to use violence
chanting we can do it we can do it
we can do it
julia bacha when i first heard about the story of budrus i was surprised that the international media had failed to cover the extraordinary set of events that happened seven years ago in
what was even more surprising was the fact that budrus was successful
the residents after months of peaceful resistance convinced the israeli government to move the route of the barrier off their lands and to the green line which is the internationally recognized boundary between israel and the palestinian territories
the resistance in budrus has since spread to villages across the west bank and to palestinian neighborhoods in jerusalem
yet the media remains mostly silent on these stories
this silence carries profound consequences for the likelihood that nonviolence can grow or even survive in palestine
violent resistance and nonviolent resistance share one very important thing in common they are both a form of theater seeking an audience to their cause
if violent actors are the only ones constantly getting front page covers and attracting international attention to the palestinian issue it becomes very hard for nonviolent leaders to make the case to their communities that civil disobedience is a viable option in addressing their plight
the power of attention is probably going to come as no surprise to the parents in the room
the surest way to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums is by giving him attention the first time he throws a fit
the tantrum will become what childhood psychologists call a functional behavior since the child has learned that he can get parental attention out of it
parents can incentivize or disincentivize behavior simply by giving or withdrawing attention to their children
but thats true for adults too
in fact the behavior of entire communities and countries can be influenced depending on where the international community chooses to focus its attention
i believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the middle east and bringing peace is for us to transform nonviolence into a functional behavior by giving a lot more attention to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today
in the course of taking my film to villages in the west bank in gaza and in east jerusalem i have seen the impact that even one documentary film can have in influencing the transformation
in a village called wallajeh which sits very close to jerusalem the community was facing a very similar plight to budrus
they were going to be surrounded lose a lot of their lands and not have freedom of access either to the west bank or jerusalem
they had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention
so we organized a screening
a week later they held the most well attended and disciplined demonstration to date
the organizers say that the villagers upon seeing the story of budrus documented in a film felt that there were indeed people following what they were doing that people cared
so they kept on going
on the israeli side there is a new peace movement called solidariot which means solidarity in hebrew
the leaders of this movement have been using budrus as one of their primary recruiting tools
they report that israelis who had never been active before upon seeing the film understand the power of nonviolence and start joining their activities
the examples of wallajeh and the solidariot movement show that even a small budget independent film can play a role in transforming nonviolence into a functional behavior
now imagine the power that big media players could have if they started covering the weekly nonviolent demonstrations happening in villages like bilin nilin wallajeh in jerusalem neighborhoods like sheikh jarrah and silwan the nonviolent leaders would become more visible valued and effective in their work
i believe that the most important thing is to understand that if we dont pay attention to these efforts they are invisible and its as if they never happened
but i have seen first hand that if we do they will multiply
if they multiply their influence will grow in the overall israeli palestinian conflict
and theirs is the kind of influence that can finally unblock the situation
these leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like budrus
lets give them attention so they can prove it works everywhere
thank you

title rob hopkins transition to a world without oil title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript rob hopkins reminds us that the oil our world depends on is steadily running out he proposes a unique solution to this problem the transition response where we prepare ourselves for life without oil and sacrifice our luxuries to build systems and communities that are completely independent of fossil fuels description
as a culture we tell ourselves lots of stories about the future and where we might move forward from this point
some of those stories are that somebody is just going to sort everything out for us
other stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling
but i want to tell you a different story here today
like all stories it has a beginning
my work for a long time has been involved in education in teaching people practical skills for sustainability teaching people how to take responsibility for growing some of their own food how to build buildings using local materials how to generate their own energy and so on
i lived in ireland built the first straw bale houses in ireland and some cob buildings and all this kind of thing
but all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustainability means basically looking at the globalized economic growth model and moderating what comes in at one end and moderating the outputs at the other end
and then i came into contact with a way of looking at things which actually changed that profoundly
and in order to introduce you to that ive got something here that im going to unveil which is one of the great marvels of the modern age
and its something so astounding and so astonishing that i think maybe as i remove this cloth a suitable gasp of amazement might be appropriate
if you could help me with that it would be fantastic
this is a liter of oil
this bottle of oil distilled over a hundred million years of geological time ancient sunlight contains the energy equivalent of about five weeks hard human manual labor equivalent to about strong people coming round and working for you
we can turn it into a dazzling array of materials medicine modern clothing laptops a whole range of different things
it gives us an energy return thats unimaginable historically
weve based the design of our settlements our business models our transport plans even the idea of economic growth some would argue on the assumption that we will have this in perpetuity
yet when we take a step back and look over the span of history at what we might call the petroleum interval its a short period in history where weve discovered this extraordinary material and then based a whole way of life around it
but as we straddle the top of this energy mountain at this stage we move from a time where our economic success our sense of individual prowess and well being is directly linked to how much of this we consume to a time when actually our degree of oil dependency is our degree of vulnerability
and its increasingly clear that we arent going to be able to rely on the fact that were going to have this at our disposal forever
for every four barrels of oil that we consume we only discover one
and that gap continues to widen
there is also the fact that the amount of energy that we get back from the oil that we discover is falling
in the we got units of energy back for every one that we put in to extract it
completely unprecedented historically
already thats fallen to about
and thats why now the new breakthroughs the new frontiers in terms of oil extraction are scrambling about in alberta or at the bottom of the oceans
there are oil producing nations in the world
but of those have already passed their peak
the moment when the world on average passes this peak people wonder when thats going to happen
and there is an emerging case that maybe that was what happened last july when the oil prices were so high
but are we to assume that the same brilliance and creativity and adaptability that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place is somehow mysteriously going to evaporate when we have to design a creative way back down the other side
no but the thinking that we have to come up with has to be based on a realistic assessment of where we are
there is also the issue of climate change is the other thing that underpins this transition approach
but the thing that i notice as i talk to climate scientists is the increasingly terrified look they have in their eyes as the data thats coming in which is far ahead of what the ipcc are talking about
so the ipcc said that we might see significant breakup of the arctic ice in in their worst case scenario
actually if current trends continue it could all be gone in five or years time
if just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost is released as the world warms it would offset all the savings that we need to make in carbon over the next years to avoid runaway climate change
we have no choice other than deep and urgent decarbonization
but im always very interested to think about what might the stories be that the generations further down the slope from us are going to tell about us
the generation that lived at the top of the mountain that partied so hard and so abused its inheritance
and one of the ways i like to do that is to look back at the stories people used to tell before we had cheap oil before we had fossil fuels and people relied on their own muscle animal muscle energy or a little bit of wind little bit of water energy
we had stories like the seven league boots the giant who had these boots where once you put them on with every stride you could cover seven leagues or miles a kind of travel completely unimaginable to people without that kind of energy at their disposal
stories like the magic porridge pot where you had a pot where if you knew the magic words this pot would just make as much food as you liked without you having to do any work provided you could remember the other magic word to stop it making porridge
otherwise youd flood your entire town with warm porridge
there is the story of the elves and the shoemaker
the people who make shoes go to sleep wake up in the morning and all the shoes are magically made for them
its something that was unimaginable to people then
now we have the seven league boots in the form of ryanair and easyjet
we have the magic porridge pot in the form of walmart and tesco
and we have the elves in the form of china
but we dont appreciate what an astonishing thing that has been
and what are the stories that we tell ourselves now as we look forward about where were going to go
and i would argue that there are four there is the idea of business as usual that the future will be like the present just more of it
but as weve seen over the last year i think thats an idea that is increasingly coming into question
and in terms of climate change is something that is not actually feasible
there is the idea of hitting the wall that actually somehow everything is so fragile that it might just all unravel and collapse
this is a popular story in some places
the third story is the idea that technology can solve everything that technology can somehow get us through this completely
and its an idea that i think is very prevalent at these ted talks the idea that we can invent our way out of a profound economic and energy crisis that a move to a knowledge economy can somehow neatly sidestep those energy constraints the idea that well discover some fabulous new source of energy that will mean we can sweep all concerns about energy security to one side the idea that we can step off neatly onto a completely renewable world
but the world isnt second life
we cant create new land and new energy systems at the click of a mouse
and as we sit exchanging free ideas with each other there are still people mining coal in order to power the servers extracting the minerals to make all of those things
the breakfast that we eat as we sit down to check our email in the morning is still transported at great distances usually at the expense of the local more resilient food systems that would have supplied that in the past which weve so effectively devalued and dismantled
we can be astonishingly inventive and creative
but we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands
energy and technology are not the same thing
what im involved with is the transition response
and this is really about looking the challenges of peak oil and climate change square in the face and responding with a creativity and an adaptability and an imagination that we really need
its something which has spread incredibly fast
and it is something which has several characteristics
its viral it seems to spread under the radar very very quickly
its open source its something which everybody whos involved with it develops and passes on as they work with it
its self organizing there is no great central organization that pushes this people just pick up an idea and they run with it and they implement it where they are
its solutions focused its very much looking at what people can do where they are to respond to this
its sensitive to place and to scale
transitional is completely different
transition groups in chile transition groups in the u s transition groups here what theyre doing looks very different in every place that you go to
it learns very much from its mistakes
and it feels historic it tries to create a sense that this is a historic opportunity to do something really extraordinary
and its a process which is really joyful
people have a huge amount of fun doing this reconnecting with other people as they do it
one of the things that underpins it is this idea of resilience
and i think in many ways the idea of resilience is a more useful concept than the idea of sustainability
the idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology
and its really about how systems settlements withstand shock from the outside
when they encounter shock from the outside that they dont just unravel and fall to pieces
and i think its a more useful concept than sustainability as i said
when our supermarkets have only two or three days worth of food in them at any one time often sustainability tends to focus on the energy efficiency of the freezers and on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in
looking through the lens of resilience we really question how weve let ourselves get into a situation thats so vulnerable
resilience runs much deeper its about building modularity into what we do building surge breakers into how we organize the basic things that support us
this is a photograph of the bristol and district market gardeners association in
this is at a time when the city of bristol which is quite close to here was surrounded by commercial market gardens which provided a significant amount of the food that was consumed in the town and created a lot of employment for people as well
there was a degree of resilience if you like at that time which we can now only look back on with envy
so how does this transition idea work
so basically you have a group of people who are excited by the idea
they pick up some of the tools that weve developed
they start to run an awareness raising program looking at how this might actually work in the town
they show films they give talks and so on
its a process which is playful and creative and informative
then they start to form working groups looking at different aspects of this and then from that there emerge a whole lot of projects which then the transition project itself starts to support and enable
so it started out with some work i was involved in in ireland where i was teaching and has since spread
there are now over formal transition projects
and there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage
they are mulling whether theyre going to take it further
and actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff
but what do they actually do you know its a kind of nice idea but what do they actually do on the ground
well i think its really important to make the point that actually you know this isnt something which is going to do everything on its own
we need international legislation from copenhagen and so on
we need national responses we need local government responses
but all of those things are going to be much easier if we have communities that are vibrant and coming up with ideas and leading from the front making unelectable policies electable over the next to years
some of the things that emerge from it are local food projects like community supported agriculture schemes urban food production creating local food directories and so on
a lot of places now are starting to set up their own energy companies community owned energy companies where the community can invest money into itself to start putting in place the kind of renewable energy infrastructure that we need
a lot of places are working with their local schools
newent in the forest of dean big polytunnel they built for the school the kids are learning how to grow food
promoting recycling things like garden share that matches up people who dont have a garden who would like to grow food with people who have gardens they arent using anymore
planting productive trees throughout urban spaces
and also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies
this is lewes in sussex who have recently launched the lewes pound a currency that you can only spend within the town as a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy
you take it anywhere else its not worth anything
but actually within the town you start to create these economic cycles much more effectively
another thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan which is basically to develop a plan b for the town
most of our local authorities when they sit down to plan for the next five years of a community still start by assuming that there will be more energy more cars more housing more jobs more growth and so on
what does it look like if thats not the case and how can we embrace that and actually come up with something that was actually more likely to sustain everybody
as a friend of mine says life is a series of things youre not quite ready for
and thats certainly been my experience with transition
from three years ago it just being an idea this has become something that has virally swept around the world
were getting a lot of interest from government ed miliband the energy minister of this country was invited to come to our recent conference as a keynote listener
which he did and has since become a great advocate of the whole idea
there are now two local authorities in this country who have declared themselves transitional local authorities leicestershire and somerset and in stroud the transition group there in effect wrote the local governments food plan
and the head of the council said if we didnt have transition stroud we would have to invent all of that community infrastructure for the first time
as we see the spread of it we see national hubs emerging
in scotland the scottish governments climate change fund has funded transition scotland as a national organization supporting the spread of this
and we see it all over the place as well now
but the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now but that things are already inevitably changing and what we need to do is to work creatively with that based on asking the right questions
i think id like to just return at the end to the idea of stories
because i think stories are vital here
and actually the stories that we tell ourselves we have a huge dearth of stories about how to move forward creatively from here
and one of the key things that transition does is to pull those stories out of what people are doing
stories about the community thats produced its own pound note for example the school thats turned its car park into a food garden the community thats founded its own energy company
and for me one of the great stories recently was the obamas digging up the south lawn of the white house to create a vegetable garden because the last time that was done when eleanor roosevelt did it it led to the creation of million vegetable gardens across the united states
so the question id like to leave you with really is for all aspects of the things that your community needs in order to thrive how can it be done in such a way that drastically reduces its carbon emissions while also building resilience
personally i feel enormously grateful to have lived through the age of cheap oil
ive been astonishingly lucky weve been astonishingly lucky
but let us honor what it has bought us and move forward from this point
because if we cling to it and continue to assume that it can underpin our choices the future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable
and by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us and that the oil age has done for us we are able to then begin the creation of a world which is more resilient more nourishing and in which we find ourselves fitter more skilled and more connected to each other
thank you very much

title elizabeth pisani sex drugs and hiv lets get rational title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript armed with bracing logic wit and her public health nerd glasses elizabeth pisani reveals the myriad of inconsistencies in todays political systems that prevent our dollars from effectively fighting the spread of hiv her research with at risk populations from junkies in prison to sex workers on the street in cambodia demonstrates the sometimes counter intuitive measures that could stall the spread of this devastating disease description
people do stupid things
thats what spreads hiv
this was a headline in a u k newspaper the guardian not that long ago
im curious show of hands who agrees with it
well one or two brave souls
this is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist whos been in field of hiv for years worked on four continents and youre looking at her
and i am now going to argue that this is only half true
people do get hiv because they do stupid things but most of them are doing stupid things for perfectly rational reasons
now rational is the dominant paradigm in public health and if you put your public health nerd glasses on youll see that if we give people the information that they need about whats good for them and whats bad for them if you give them the services that they can use to act on that information and a little bit of motivation people will make rational decisions and live long and healthy lives
wonderful
thats slightly problematic for me because i work in hiv and although im sure you all know that hiv is about poverty and gender inequality and if you were at ted its about coffee prices
actually hivs about sex and drugs and if there are two things that make human beings a little bit irrational they are erections and addiction
so lets start with whats rational for an addict
now i remember speaking to an indonesian friend of mine frankie
we were having lunch and he was telling me about when he was in jail in bali for a drug injection
it was someones birthday and they had very kindly smuggled some heroin into jail and he was very generously sharing it out with all of his colleagues
and so everyone lined up all the smackheads in a row and the guy whose birthday it was filled up the fit and he went down and started injecting people
so he injects the first guy and then hes wiping the needle on his shirt and he injects the next guy
and frankie says im number in line and i can see the needle coming down towards me and there is blood all over the place
its getting blunter and blunter
and a small part of my brain is thinking that is so gross and really dangerous but most of my brain is thinking please let there be some smack left by the time it gets to me
please let there be some left and then telling me this story frankie said you know god drugs really make you stupid
and you know you cant fault him for accuracy
but actually frankie at that time was a heroin addict and he was in jail
so his choice was either to accept that dirty needle or not to get high
and if theres one place you really want to get high its when youre in jail
but im a scientist and i dont like to make data out of anecdotes so lets look at some data
we talked to drug addicts in three cities in indonesia and we said well do you know how you get hiv
oh yeah by sharing needles
i mean nearly percent yeah by sharing needles
and do you know where you can get a clean needle at a price you can afford to avoid that
oh yeah hundred percent
were smackheads we know where to get clean needles
so are you carrying a needle
were actually interviewing people on the street in the places where theyre hanging out and taking drugs
are you carrying clean needles
one in four maximum
so no surprises then that the proportion that actually used clean needles every time they injected in the last week is just about one in and the other nine in are sharing
so youve got this massive mismatch everyone knows that if they share theyre going to get hiv but theyre all sharing anyway
so whats that about is it like you get a better high if you share or something
we asked that to a junkie and theyre like are you nuts
you dont want to share a needle anymore than you want to share a toothbrush even with someone youre sleeping with
theres just kind of an ick factor there
no no we share needles because we dont want to go to jail
so in indonesia at this time if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up they could put you into jail
and that changes the equation slightly doesnt it
because your choice now is either i use my own needle now or i could share a needle now and get a disease thats going to possibly kill me years from now or i could use my own needle now and go to jail tomorrow
and while junkies think that its a really bad idea to expose themselves to hiv they think its a much worse idea to spend the next year in jail where theyll probably end up in frankies situation and expose themselves to hiv anyway
so suddenly it becomes perfectly rational to share needles
now lets look at it from a policy makers point of view
this is a really easy problem
for once your incentives are aligned
weve got whats rational for public health
you want people to use clean needles and junkies want to use clean needles
so we could make this problem go away simply by making clean needles universally available and taking away the fear of arrest
now the first person to figure that out and do something about it on a national scale was that well known bleeding heart liberal margaret thatcher
and she put in the worlds first national needle exchange program and other countries followed suit australia the netherlands and few others
and in all of those countries you can see not more than four percent of injectors ever became infected with hiv
now places that didnt do this new york city for example moscow jakarta were talking at its peak one in two injectors infected with this fatal disease
now margaret thatcher didnt do this because she has any great love for junkies
she did it because she ran a country that had a national health service
so if she didnt invest in effective prevention she was going to have pick up the costs of treatment later on and obviously those are much higher
so she was making a politically rational decision
now if i take out my public health nerd glasses here and look at these data it seems like a no brainer doesnt it
but in this country where the government apparently does not feel compelled to provide health care for citizens weve taken a very different approach
so what weve been doing in the united states is reviewing the data endlessly reviewing the data
so these are reviews of hundreds of studies by all the big muckety mucks of the scientific pantheon in the united states and these are the studies that show needle programs are effective quite a lot of them
now the ones that show that needle programs arent effective you think thats one of these annoying dynamic slides and im going to press my dongle and the rest of its going to come up but no thats the whole slide
there is nothing on the other side
so completely irrational you would think
except that wait a minute politicians are rational too and theyre responding to what they think the voters want
so what we see is that voters respond very well to things like this and not quite so well to things like this
so it becomes quite rational to deny services to injectors
now lets talk about sex
are we any more rational about sex
well im not even going to address the clearly irrational positions of people like the catholic church who think somehow that if you give out condoms everyones going to run out and have sex
i dont know if pope benedict watches tedtalks online but if you do ive got news for you benedict i carry condoms all the time and i never get laid
its not that easy
here maybe youll have better luck
okay seriously hiv is actually not that easy to transmit sexually
so it depends on how much virus there is in your blood and in your body fluids
and what weve got is a very very high level of virus right at the beginning when youre first infected then you start making antibodies and then it bumps along at quite low levels for a long time or years you have spikes if you get another sexually transmitted infection
but basically nothing much is going on until you start to get symptomatic aids and by that stage youre not looking great youre not feeling great youre not having that much sex
so the sexual transmission of hiv is essentially determined by how many partners you have in these very short spaces of time when you have peak viremia
now this makes people crazy because it means that you have to talk about some groups having more sexual partners in shorter spaces of time than other groups and thats considered stigmatizing
ive always been a bit curious about that because i think stigma is a bad thing whereas lots of sex is quite a good thing but well leave that be
the truth is that years of very good research have shown us that there are groups that are more likely to turnover large numbers of partners in a short space of time
and those groups are globally people who sell sex and their more regular partners
they are gay men on the party scene who have on average three times more partners than straight people on the party scene
and they are heterosexuals who come from countries that have traditions of polygamy and relatively high levels of female autonomy and almost all of those countries are in east or southern africa
and that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today
you can see these horrifying figures from africa
these are all countries in southern africa where between one in seven and one in three of all adults are infected with hiv
now in the rest of the world weve got basically nothing going on in the general population very very low levels but we have extraordinarily high levels of hiv in these other populations who are at highest risk drug injectors sex workers and gay men
and youll note thats the local data from los angeles percent prevalence among gay men
of course you cant get hiv just by having unprotected sex
you can only hiv by having unprotected sex with a positive person
in most of the world these few prevention failures notwithstanding we are actually doing quite well these days in commercial sex condom use rates are between and percent in commercial sex in most countries
and again its because of an alignment of the incentives
whats rational for public health is also rational for individual sex workers because its really bad for business to have another sti
no one wants it
and actually clients dont want to go home with a drip either
so essentially youre able to achieve quite high rates of condom use in commercial sex
but in intimate relations its much more difficult because with your wife or your boyfriend or someone that you hope might turn into one of those things we have this illusion of romance and trust and intimacy and nothing is quite so unromantic as the my condom or yours darling question
so in the face of that you really need quite a strong incentive to use condoms
this for example this gentleman is called joseph
hes from haiti and he has aids
and hes probably not having a lot of sex right now but he is a reminder in the population of why you might want to be using condoms
this is also in haiti and is a reminder of why you might want to be having sex perhaps
now funnily enough this is also joseph after six months on antiretroviral treatment
not for nothing do we call it the lazarus effect
but it is changing the equation of whats rational in sexual decision making
so what weve got some people say oh it doesnt matter very much because actually treatment is effective prevention because it lowers your viral load and therefore makes it more difficult to transmit hiv
so if you look at the viremia thing again if you do start treatment when youre sick well what happens your viral load comes down
but compared to what what happens if youre not on treatment
well you die so your viral load goes to zero
and all of this green stuff here including the spikes which are because you couldnt get to the pharmacy or you ran out of drugs or you went on a three day party binge and forgot to take your drugs or because youve started to get resistance or whatever all of that is virus that wouldnt be out there except for treatment
now am i saying oh well great prevention strategy
lets just stop treating people
of course not of course not
we need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can
but what i am doing is calling into question those people who say that more treatment is all the prevention we need
thats simply not necessarily true and i think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men in rich countries where treatment has been widely available for going on years now
and what weve seen is that actually condom use rates which were very very high the gay community responded very rapidly to hiv with extremely little help from public health nerds i would say that condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment for two reasons really one is the assumption of oh well if hes infected hes probably on meds and his viral loads going to be low so im pretty safe
and the other thing is that people are simply not as scared of hiv as they were of aids and rightly so
aids was a disfiguring disease that killed you and hiv is an invisible virus that makes you take a pill every day
and thats boring but is it as boring as having to use a condom every time you have sex no matter how drunk you are no matter how many poppers youve taken whatever
if we look at the data we can see that the answer to that question is mmm
so these are data from scotland
you see the peak in drug injectors before they started the national needle exchange program
then it came way down
and both in heterosexuals mostly in commercial sex and in drug users youve really got nothing much going on after treatment begins and thats because of that alignment of incentives that i talked about earlier
but in gay men youve got quite a dramatic rise starting three or four years after treatment became widely available
this is of new infections
what does that mean
it means that the combined effect of being less worried and having more virus out there in the population more people living longer healthier lives more likely to be getting laid with hiv is outweighing the effects of lower viral load and thats a very worrisome thing
what does it mean
it means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have
is that whats happening
no and i call it the compassion conundrum
weve talked a lot about compassion the last couple of days and whats happening really is that people are unable quite to bring themselves to put in good sexual and reproductive health services for sex workers unable quite to be giving out needles to junkies
but once theyve gone from being transgressive people whose behaviors we dont want to condone to being aids victims we come over all compassionate and buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives
it doesnt make any sense from a public health point of view
i want to give whats very nearly the last word to ines
ines is a a transgender hooker on the streets of jakarta shes a chick with a dick
why does she do that job
well of course because shes forced into it because she doesnt have any better option etc etc
and if we could just teach her to sew and get her a nice job in a factory all would be well
this is what factory workers earn in an hour in indonesia on average cents
it varies a bit province to province
i do speak to sex workers of them for this particular slide and this is what sex workers say they earn in an hour
so its not a great job but for a lot of people it really is quite a rational choice
okay ines
weve got the tools the knowledge and the cash and commitment to preventing hiv too
ines so why is prevalence still rising
its all politics
when you get to politics nothing makes sense
elizabeth pisani when you get to politics nothing makes sense
so from the point of view of a sex worker politicians are making no sense
from the point of view of a public health nerd junkies are doing dumb things
the truth is that everyone has a different rationale
there are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet and thats one of the glories of human existence
but those ways of being rational are not independent of one another so its rational for a drug injector to share needles because of a stupid decision thats made by a politician and its rational for a politician to make that stupid decision because theyre responding to what they think the voters want
but heres the thing we are the voters
were not all of them of course but ted is a community of opinion leaders
and everyone whos in this room and everyone whos watching this out there on the web i think has a duty to demand of their politicians that we make policy based on scientific evidence and on common sense
its going to be really hard for us to individually affect whats rational for every frankie and every ines out there but you can at least use your vote to stop politicians doing stupid things that spread hiv
thank you

title ellen dunham jones retrofitting suburbia title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript can we rebuild our broken suburbs ellen dunham jones shares a vision of dying malls rehabilitated dead big box stores re inhabited and endless parking lots transformed into thriving wetlands description
in the last years weve been building the suburbs with a lot of unintended consequences
and im going to talk about some of those consequences and just present a whole bunch of really interesting projects that i think give us tremendous reasons to be really optimistic that the big design and development project of the next years is going to be retrofitting suburbia
so whether its redeveloping dying malls or re inhabiting dead big box stores or reconstructing wetlands out of parking lots i think the fact is the growing number of empty and under performing especially retail sites throughout suburbia gives us actually a tremendous opportunity to take our least sustainable landscapes right now and convert them into more sustainable places
and in the process what that allows us to do is to redirect a lot more of our growth back into existing communities that could use a boost and have the infrastructure in place instead of continuing to tear down trees and to tear up the green space out at the edges
so why is this important
i think there are any number of reasons and im just going to not get into detail but mention a few
just from the perspective of climate change the average urban dweller in the u s
has about one third the carbon footprint of the average suburban dweller mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more and living in detached buildings you have that much more exterior surface to leak energy out of
so strictly from the cities are already relatively green
the big opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is actually in urbanizing the suburbs
all that driving that weve been doing out in the suburbs we have doubled the amount of miles we drive
its increased our dependence on foreign oil despite the gains in fuel efficiency
were just driving so much more we havent been able to keep up technologically
public health is another reason to consider retrofitting
researchers at the cdc and other places have increasingly been linking suburban development patterns with sedentary lifestyles
and those have been linked then with the rather alarming growing rates of obesity shown in these maps here and that obesity has also been triggering great increases in heart disease and diabetes to the point where a child born today has a one in three chance of developing diabetes
and that rate has been escalating at the same rate as children not walking to school anymore again because of our development patterns
and then theres finally theres the affordability question
i mean how affordable is it to continue to live in suburbia with rising gas prices
suburban expansion to cheap land for the last years you know the cheap land out on the edge has helped generations of families enjoy the american dream
but increasingly the savings promised by drive till you qualify affordability which is basically our model those savings are wiped out when you consider the transportation costs
for instance here in atlanta about half of households make between and a year and they are spending percent of their income on housing and percent on transportation
i mean thats figures
thats before we got up to the four bucks a gallon
you know none of us really tend to do the math on our transportation costs and theyre not going down any time soon
whether you love suburbias leafy privacy or you hate its soulless commercial strips there are reasons why its important to retrofit
but is it practical
i think it is
june williamson and i have been researching this topic for over a decade and weve found over varied projects
but that theyre really all market driven and whats driving the market in particular number one is major demographic shifts
we all tend to think of suburbia as this very family focused place but thats really not the case anymore
since already two thirds of households in suburbia did not have kids in them
we just havent caught up with the actual realities of this
the reasons for this have a lot to with the dominance of the two big demographic groups right now the baby boomers retiring and then theres a gap generation x which is a small generation
theyre still having kids but generation y hasnt even started hitting child rearing age
theyre the other big generation
so as a result of that demographers predict that through to percent of new households will not have kids in them
and the market research consumer research asking the boomers and gen y what it is they would like what they would like to live in tells us there is going to be a huge demand and were already seeing it for more urban lifestyles within suburbia
that basically the boomers want to be able to age in place and gen y would like to live an urban lifestyle but most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia
the other big dynamic of change is the sheer performance of underperforming asphalt
now i keep thinking this would be a great name for an indie rock band but developers generally use it to refer to underused parking lots and suburbia is full of them
when the postwar suburbs were first built out on the cheap land away from downtown it made sense to just build surface parking lots
but those sites have now been leapfrogged and leapfrogged again as weve just continued to sprawl and they now have a relatively central location
it no longer just makes sense
that land is more valuable than just surface parking lots
it now makes sense to go back in build a deck and build up on those sites
so what do you do with a dead mall dead office park
it turns out all sorts of things
in a slow economy like ours re inhabitation is one of the more popular strategies
so this happens to be a dead mall in st louis thats been re inhabited as art space
its now home to artist studios theater groups dance troupes
its not pulling in as much tax revenue as it once was but its serving its community
its keeping the lights on
its becoming i think a really great institution
other malls have been re inhabited as nursing homes as universities and as all variety of office space
we also found a lot of examples of dead big box stores that have been converted into all sorts of community serving uses as well lots of schools lots of churches and lots of libraries like this one
this was a little grocery store a food lion grocery store that is now a public library
in addition to i think doing a beautiful adaptive reuse they tore up some of the parking spaces put in bioswales to collect and clean the runoff put in a lot more sidewalks to connect to the neighborhoods
and theyve made this what was just a store along a commercial strip into a community gathering space
this one is a little l shaped strip shopping center in phoenix arizona
really all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint a gourmet grocery and they put up a restaurant in the old post office
never underestimate the power of food to turn a place around and make it a destination
its been so successful theyve now taken over the strip across the street
the real estate ads in the neighborhood all very proudly proclaim walking distance to le grande orange because it provided its neighborhood with what sociologists like to call a third place
if home is the first place and work is the second place the third place is where you go to hang out and build community
and especially as suburbia is becoming less centered on the family the family households theres a real hunger for more third places
so the most dramatic retrofits are really those in the next category the next strategy redevelopment
now during the boom there were several really dramatic redevelopment projects where the original building was scraped to the ground and then the whole site was rebuilt at significantly greater density a sort of compact walkable urban neighborhoods
but some of them have been much more incremental
this is mashpee commons the oldest retrofit that weve found
and its just incrementally over the last years built urbanism on top of its parking lots
so the black and white photo shows the simple strip shopping center
and then the maps above that show its gradual transformation into a compact mixed use new england village and it has plans now that have been approved for it to connect to new residential neighborhoods across the arterials and over to the other side
so you know sometimes its incremental
sometimes its all at once
this is another infill project on the parking lots this one of an office park outside of washington d c
when metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs and opened a station nearby to this site the owners decided to build a new parking deck and then insert on top of their surface lots and condo buildings while keeping the existing office buildings
here is the site in it was just a little farm in the village of hyattsville
by it had been subdivided into a big mall on one side and the office park on the other and then some buffer sites for a library and a church to the far right
today the transit the main street and the new housing have all been built
eventually i expect that the streets will probably extend through a redevelopment of the mall
plans have already been announced for a lot of those garden apartments above the mall to be redeveloped
transit is a big driver of retrofits
so heres what it looks like
you can sort of see the funky new condo buildings in between the office buildings and the public space and the new main street
this one is one of my favorites belmar
i think they really built an attractive place here and have just employed all green construction
theres massive p v arrays on the roofs as well as wind turbines
this was a very large mall on a hundred acre superblock
its now walkable urban blocks with public streets two public parks eight bus lines and a range of housing types and so its really given lakewood colorado the downtown that this particular suburb never had
here was the mall in its heyday
they had their prom in the mall they loved their mall
so heres the site in with the mall
by the mall has died
the department store has been kept and we found this was true in many cases
the department stores are multistory theyre better built
theyre easy to be re adapted
but the one story stuff
thats really history
so here it is at projected build out
this project i think has great connectivity to the existing neighborhoods
its providing households with the option of a more urban lifestyle
its about two thirds built out right now
heres what the new main street looks like
its very successful and its helped to prompt eight of the regional malls in denver have now or have announced plans to be retrofitted
but its important to note that all of this retrofitting is not occurring no its pockets of walkability on the sites of under performing properties
and so its giving people more choices but its not taking away choices
but its also not really enough to just create pockets of walkability
you want to also try to get more systemic transformation
we need to also retrofit the corridors themselves
so this is one that has been retrofitted in california
they took the commercial strip shown on the black and white images below and they built a boulevard that has become the main street for their town
and its transformed from being an ugly unsafe undesirable address to becoming a beautiful attractive dignified sort of good address
i mean now were hoping we start to see it theyve already built city hall attracted two hotels
i could imagine beautiful housing going up along there without tearing down another tree
so theres a lot of great things but id love to see more corridors getting retrofitting
but densification is not going to work everywhere
sometimes re greening is really the better answer
theres a lot to learn from successful landbanking programs in cities like flint michigan
theres also a burgeoning suburban farming movement sort of victory gardens meets the internet
but perhaps one of the most important re greening aspects is the opportunity to restore the local ecology as in this example outside of minneapolis
when the shopping center died the city restored the sites original wetlands creating lakefront property which then attracted private investment the first private investment to this very low income neighborhood in over years
so theyve managed to both restore the local ecology and the local economy at the same time
this is another re greening example
it also makes sense in very strong markets
this one in seattle is on the site of a mall parking lot adjacent to a new transit stop
and the wavy line is a path alongside a creek that has now been daylit
the creek had been culverted under the parking lot
but daylighting our creeks really improves their water quality and contributions to habitat
so ive shown you some of the first generation of retrofits
whats next
i think we have three challenges for the future
the first is to plan retrofitting much more systemically at the metropolitan scale
we need to be able to target which areas really should be re greened
where should we be redeveloping
and where should we be encouraging re inhabitation
these slides just show two images from a larger project that looked at trying to do that for atlanta
i led a team that was asked to imagine atlanta years from now
and we chose to try to reverse sprawl through three simple moves expensive but simple
one in a hundred years transit on all major rail and road corridors
two in a hundred years thousand foot buffers on all stream corridors
its a little extreme but weve got a little water problem
in a hundred years subdivisions that simply end up too close to water or too far from transit wont be viable
and so weve created the eco acre transfer to transfer development rights to the transit corridors and allow the re greening of those former subdivisions for food and energy production
so the second challenge is to improve the architectural design quality of the retrofits
and i close with this image of democracy in action this is a protest thats happening on a retrofit in silver spring maryland on an astroturf town green
now retrofits are often accused of being examples of faux downtowns and instant urbanism and not without reason you dont get much more phony than an astroturf town green
i have to say these are very hybrid places
they are new but trying to look old
they have urban streetscapes but suburban parking ratios
their populations are more diverse than typical suburbia but theyre less diverse than cities
and they are public places but that are managed by private companies
and just the surface appearance are often like the astroturf here they make me wince
so you know i mean im glad that the urbanism is doing its job
the fact that a protest is happening really does mean that the layout of the blocks the streets and blocks the putting in of public space compromised as it may be is still a really great thing
but weve got to get the architecture better
the final challenge is for all of you
i want you to join the protest and start demanding more sustainable suburban places more sustainable places period
but culturally we tend to think that downtowns should be dynamic and we expect that
but we seem to have an expectation that the suburbs should forever remain frozen in whatever adolescent form they were first given birth to
its time to let them grow up so i want you to all support the zoning changes the road diets the infrastructure improvements and the retrofits that are coming soon to a neighborhood near you
thank you

title mitchell besser mothers helping mothers fight hiv title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript in sub saharan africa hiv infections are more prevalent and doctors scarcer than anywhere else in the world with a lack of medical professionals mitchell besser enlisted the help of his patients to create an extraordinary network of hiv positive women whose support for each other is changing and saving lives description
i want you to take a trip with me
picture yourself driving down a small road in africa and as you drive along you look off to the side and this is what you see you see a field of graves
and you stop and you get out of your car and you take a picture
and you go into the town and you inquire whats going on here
and people are initially reluctant to tell you
and then someone says these are the recent aids deaths in our community
hiv isnt like other medical conditions its stigmatizing
people are reluctant to talk about it theres a fear associated with it
and im going to talk about hiv today about the deaths about the stigma
its a medical story but more than that its a social story
this map depicts the global distribution of hiv
and as you can see africa has a disproportionate share of the infection
there are million people living with hiv in the world today
of these two thirds million are living in sub saharan africa
there are million pregnant women in low and middle income countries living with hiv and of these percent are in sub saharan africa
we talk about things in relative terms
and im going to talk about annual pregnancies and hiv positive mothers
the united states a large country each year mothers with hiv who give birth to a child
but you go to rwanda a very small country mothers with hiv who are pregnant
and then you go to baragwanath hospital outside of johannesburg in south africa and hiv positive pregnant women giving birth a hospital the same as a country
and to realize that this is just the tip of an iceberg that when you compare everything here to south africa it just pales because in south africa each year mothers with hiv give birth to children
so we talk about pmtct and we refer to pmtct prevention of mother to child transmission
i think theres an assumption amongst most people in the public that if a mother is hiv positive shes going to infect her child
the reality is really very different
in resource rich countries with all the tests and treatment we currently have less than two percent of babies are born hiv positive percent of babies are born hiv negative
and yet the reality in resource poor countries in the absence of tests and treatment percent percent of children are infected percent versus two percent an enormous difference
so these programs and im going to refer to pmtct though my talk these prevention programs simply theyre the tests and the drugs that we give to mothers to prevent them from infecting their babies and also the medicines we give to mothers to keep them healthy and alive to raise their children
so its the test a mother gets when she comes in
its the drugs she receives to protect the baby thats inside the uterus and during delivery
its the guidance she gets around infant feeding and safer sex
its an entire package of services and it works
so in the united states since the advent of treatment in the middle of the theres been an percent decline in the number of hiv infected children
less than babies are born with hiv each year in the united states and yet still over children are born every year in the world today with hiv
what does that mean
it means children infected each day children each day infected with hiv
and where do they come from
well less than one comes from the united states
one on average comes from europe
come from asia and the pacific
and each day a thousand babies a thousand babies are born each day with hiv in africa
so again i look at the globe here and the disproportionate share of hiv in africa
and lets look at another map
and here again we see africa has a disproportionate share of the numbers of doctors
that thin sliver you see here thats africa
and its the same with nurses
the truth is sub saharan africa has percent of the global disease burden and yet only three percent of the worlds health care workers
that means doctors and nurses simply dont have the time to take care of patients
a nurse in a busy clinic will see to patients in a day which leaves her just minutes per patient minutes per patient
and so when we look at these pmtct programs what does it mean
well back in when there was just a simple test and a single dose of a drug a nurse in the course of her few minutes with a patient would have to counsel for the hiv test perform the hiv test explain the results dispense a single dose of the drug nevirapine explain how to take it discuss infant feeding options reinforce infant feeding and test the baby in minutes
well fortunately since weve got new treatments new tests and were far more successful but we dont have any more nurses
and so these are the tests a nurse now has to do in those same few minutes
its not possible it doesnt work
and so we need to find better ways of providing care
this is a picture of a maternal health clinic in africa mothers coming pregnant and with their babies
these women are here for care but we know that just doing a test just giving someone a drug its not enough
meds dont equal medical care
doctors and nurses frankly dont have the time or skills to tell people what to do in ways they understand
im a doctor i tell people things to do and i expect them to follow my guidance because im a doctor i went to harvard but the reality is if i tell a patient you should have safer sex
you should always use a condom and yet in her relationship shes not empowered whats going to happen
if i tell her to take her medicines every day and yet no one in the household knows about her illness so its just not going to work
and so we need to do more we need to do it differently we need to do it in ways that are affordable and accessible and can be taken to scale which means it can be done everywhere
so i want to tell you a story i want to take you on a little trip
imagine yourself if you can youre a young woman in africa youre going to the hospital or clinic
you go in for a test and you find out that youre pregnant and youre delighted
and then they give you another test and they tell you youre hiv positive and youre devastated
and the nurse takes you into a room and she tells you about the tests and hiv and the medicines you can take and how to take care of yourself and your baby and you hear none of it
all youre hearing is im going to die and my baby is going to die
and then youre out on the street and you dont know where to go
and you dont know who you can talk to because the truth is hiv is so stigmatizing that if you partner your family anyone in your home youre likely to be thrown out without any means of support
and this this is the face and story of hiv in africa today
but were here to talk about possible solutions and some good news
and i want to change the story a little bit
take the same mother and the nurse after she gives her her test takes her to a room
the door opens and theres a room full of mothers mothers with babies and theyre sitting and theyre talking theyre listening
theyre drinking tea theyre having sandwiches
and she goes inside and woman comes up to her and says welcome to
have a seat youre safe here
were all hiv positive
youre going to be okay youre going to live
your baby is going to be hiv negative
we view mothers as a communitys single greatest resource
mothers take care of the children take care of the home
so often the men are gone
theyre working or theyre not part of the household
our organization enlists women with hiv as care providers
we bring mothers who have hiv whove been through these pmtct programs in the very facilities to come back and work side by side with doctors and nurses as part of the health care team
these mothers we call them mentor mothers are able to engage women who just like themselves pregnant with babies have found out about being hiv positive who need support and education
and they support them around the diagnosis and educate them about how to take their medicines how to take care of themselves how to take care of their babies
consider if you needed surgery you would want the best possible technical surgeon right
but if you wanted to understand what that surgery would do to your life youd like to engage someone someone whos had the procedure
patients are experts on their own experience and they can share that experience with others
this is the medical care that goes beyond just medicines
so the mothers who work for us they come from the communities in which they work
theyre hired theyre paid as professional members of the health care teams just like doctors and nurses
and we open bank accounts for them and theyre paid directly into the accounts because their moneys protected the men cant take it away from them
they go through two to three weeks of rigorous curriculum based education training
now doctors and nurses they too get trained
but so often they only get trained once so theyre not aware of new medicines new guidelines as they come out
our mentor mothers get trained every single year and retrained
and so doctors and nurses they look up to them as experts
imagine that a woman a former patient being able to educate her doctor for the first time and educate the other patients that shes taking care of
our organization has three goals
the first to prevent mother to child transmission
the second keep mothers healthy keep mothers alive keep the children alive no more orphans
and the third and maybe the most grand is to find ways to empower women enable them to fight the stigma and to live positive and productive lives with hiv
so how do we do it
well maybe the most important engagement is the one to one seeing patients one to one educating them supporting them explaining how they can take care of themselves
we go beyond that we try to bring in the husbands the partners
in africa its very very hard to engage men
men are not frequently part of pregnancy care
but in rwanda in one country theyve got a policy that a woman cant come for care unless she brings the father of the baby with her thats the rule
and so the father and the mother together go through the counseling and the testing
the father and the mother together they get the results
and this is so important in breaking through the stigma
disclosure is so central to prevention
how do you have safer sex how do you use a condom regularly if there hasnt been disclosure
disclosure is so important to treatment because again people need the support of family members and friends to take their medicines regularly
we also work in groups
now the groups its not like me lecturing but what happens is women they come together under the support and guidance of our mentor mothers they come together and they share their personal experiences
and its through the sharing that people get tactics of how to take care of themselves how to disclose how to take medicines
and then theres the community outreach engaging women in their communities
if we can change the way households believe and think we can change the way communities believe and think
and if we can change enough communities we can change national attitudes
we can change national attitudes to women and national attitudes to hiv
the hardest barrier really is around stigma reduction
we have the medicines we have the tests but how do you reduce the stigma
and its important about disclosure
so a couple years ago one of the mentor mothers came back and she told me a story
she had been asked by one of the clients to go to the home of the client because the client wanted to tell the mother and her brothers and sisters about her hiv status and she was afraid to go by herself
and so the mentor mother went along with
and the patient walked into the house and said to her mother and siblings i have something to tell you im hiv positive
and everybody was quiet
and then her oldest brother stood up and said i too have something to tell you
im hiv positive
ive been afraid to tell everybody
and then this older sister stood up and said i too am living with the virus and ive been ashamed
and then her younger brother stood up and said im also positive
i thought you were going to throw me out of the family
and you see where this is going
the last sister stood up and said im also positive
i thought you were going to hate me
and there they were all of them together for the first time being able to share this experience for the first time and to support each other for the first time
female narrator women come to us and they are crying and scared
i tell them my story that i am hiv positive but my child is hiv negative
i tell them you are going to make it and you will raise a healthy baby
i am proof that there is hope
mitchell besser remember the images i showed you of how few doctors and nurses there are in africa
and it is a crisis in health care systems
even as we have more tests and more drugs we cant reach people we dont have enough providers
so we talk in terms of what we call task shifting
task shifting is traditionally when you take health care services from one provider and have another provider do it
typically its a doctor giving a job to a nurse
and the issue in africa is that there are fewer nurses really than doctors and so we need to find new paradigm for health care
how do you build a better health care system
weve chosen to redefine the health care system as a doctor a nurse and a mentor mother
and so what nurses do is that they ask the mentor mothers to explain how to take the drugs the side effects
they delegate education about infant feeding family planning safer sex actions that nurses simple just dont have time for
so we go back to the prevention of mother to child transmission
the world is increasingly seeing these programs as the bridge to comprehensive maternal and child health
and our organization helps women across that bridge
the care doesnt stop when the babys born we deal with the ongoing health of the mother and baby ensuring that they live healthy successful lives
our organization works on three levels
the first at the patient level mothers and babies keeping babies from getting hiv keeping mothers healthy to raise them
the second communities empowering women
they become leaders within their communities
they change the way communities think we need to change attitudes to hiv
we need to change attitudes to women in africa
we have to do that
and then rework the level of the health care systems building stronger health care systems
our health care systems are broken
theyre not going to work the way theyre currently designed
and so doctors and nurses who need to try to change peoples behaviors dont have the skills dont have the time our mentor mothers do
and so in redefining the health care teams by bringing the mentor mothers in we can do that
i started the program in capetown south africa back in
it was at that point just the spark of an idea
referencing steven johnsons very lovely speech yesterday on where ideas come from i was in the shower at the time i was alone
the program is now working in nine countries we have program sites were seeing about women every month were employing mentor mothers and last year they enrolled hiv positive pregnant women and mothers
that is percent of the global hiv positive pregnant women percent of the world
whats extraordinary is how simple the premise is
mothers with hiv caring for mothers with hiv
past patients taking care of present patients
and empowerment through employment reducing stigma
female narrator there is hope hope that one day we shall win this fight against hiv and aids
each person must know their hiv status
those who are hiv negative must know how to stay negative
those who are hiv infected must know how to take care of themselves
hiv positive pregnant women must get pmtct services in order to have hiv negative babies
all of this is possible if we each contribute to this fight
mb simple solutions to complex problems
mothers caring for mothers
its transformational
thank you

title tristram stuart the global food waste scandal title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript western countries throw out nearly half of their food not because it s inedible but because it doesn t look appealing tristram stuart delves into the shocking data of wasted food calling for a more responsible use of global resources description
the job of uncovering the global food waste scandal started for me when i was years old
i bought some pigs i was living in sussex
and i started to feed them in the most traditional and environmentally friendly way
i went to my school kitchen and i said give me the scraps that my school friends have turned their noses up at
i went to the local baker and took their stale bread
i went to the local greengrocer and i went to a farmer who was throwing away potatoes because they were the wrong shape or size for supermarkets
this was great my pigs turned that food waste into delicious pork i sold that pork to my school friends parents and i made a good pocket money addition to my teenage allowance
but i noticed that most of the food that i was giving my pigs was in fact fit for human consumption and that i was only scratching the surface and that right the way up the food supply chain in supermarkets greengrocers bakers in our homes in factories and farms we were hemorrhaging out food
supermarkets didnt even want to talk to me about how much food they were wasting
id been round the back id seen bins full of food being locked and then trucked off to landfill sites and i thought surely there is something more sensible to do with food than waste it
one morning when i was feeding my pigs i noticed a particularly tasty looking sun dried tomato loaf that used to crop up from time to time
i grabbed hold of it sat down and ate my breakfast with my pigs
that was the first act of what i later learned to call freeganism really an exhibition of the injustice of food waste and the provision of the solution to food waste which is simply to sit down and eat food rather than throwing it away
that became as it were a way of confronting large businesses in the business of wasting food and exposing most importantly to the public that when were talking about food being thrown away were not talking about rotten stuff were not talking about stuff thats beyond the pale
were talking about good fresh food that is being wasted on a colossal scale
eventually i set about writing my book really to demonstrate the extent of this problem on a global scale what this shows is a nation by nation breakdown of the likely level of food waste in each country in the world
unfortunately empirical data good hard stats dont exist and therefore to prove my point i first of all had to find some proxy way of uncovering how much food was being wasted
so i took the food supply of every single country and i compared it to what was actually likely to be being consumed in each country
thats based on diet intake surveys its based on levels of obesity its based on a range of factors that gives you an approximate guess as to how much food is actually going into peoples mouths
that black line in the middle of that table is the likely level of consumption with an allowance for certain levels of inevitable waste
there will always be waste im not that unrealistic that i think we can live in a waste free world
but that black line shows what a food supply should be in a country if they allow for a good stable secure nutritional diet for every person in that country
any dot above that line and youll quickly notice that that includes most countries in the world represents unnecessary surplus and is likely to reflect levels of waste in each country
as a country gets richer it invests more and more in getting more and more surplus into its shops and restaurants and as you can see most european and north american countries fall between and percent of the nutritional requirements of their populations
so a country like america has twice as much food on its shop shelves and in its restaurants than is actually required to feed the american people
but the thing that really struck me when i plotted all this data and it was a lot of numbers was that you can see how it levels off
countries rapidly shoot towards that mark and then they level off and they dont really go on rising as you might expect
so i decided to unpack that data a little bit further to see if that was true or false
and thats what i came up with
if you include not just the food that ends up in shops and restaurants but also the food that people feed to livestock the maize the soy the wheat that humans could eat but choose to fatten livestock instead to produce increasing amounts of meat and dairy products what you find is that most rich countries have between three and four times the amount of food that their population needs to feed itself
a country like america has four times the amount of food that it needs
when people talk about the need to increase global food production to feed those nine billion people that are expected on the planet by i always think of these graphs
the fact is we have an enormous buffer in rich countries between ourselves and hunger
weve never had such gargantuan surpluses before
in many ways this is a great success story of human civilization of the agricultural surpluses that we set out to achieve years ago
it is a success story it has been a success story
but what we have to recognize now is that we are reaching the ecological limits that our planet can bear and when we chop down forests as we are every day to grow more and more food when we extract water from depleting water reserves when we emit fossil fuel emissions in the quest to grow more and more food and then we throw away so much of it we have to think about what we can start saving
and yesterday i went to one of the local supermarkets that i often visit to inspect if you like what theyre throwing away
i found quite a few packets of biscuits amongst all the fruit and vegetables and everything else that was in there
and i thought well this could serve as a symbol for today
so i want you to imagine that these nine biscuits that i found in the bin represent the global food supply okay we start out with nine
thats whats in fields around the world every single year
the first biscuit were going to lose before we even leave the farm
thats a problem primarily associated with developing work agriculture whether its a lack of infrastructure refrigeration pasteurization grain stores even basic fruit crates which means that food goes to waste before it even leaves the fields
the next three biscuits are the foods that we decide to feed to livestock the maize the wheat and the soya
unfortunately our beasts are inefficient animals and they turn two thirds of that into feces and heat so weve lost those two and weve only kept this one in meat and dairy products
two more were going to throw away directly into bins
this is what most of us think of when we think of food waste what ends up in the garbage what ends up in supermarket bins what ends up in restaurant bins weve lost another two and weve left ourselves with just four biscuits to feed on
that is not a superlatively efficient use of global resources especially when you think of the billion hungry people that exist already in the world
having gone through the data i then needed to demonstrate where that food ends up
where does it end up were used to seeing the stuff on our plates but what about all the stuff that goes missing in between
supermarkets are an easy place to start
this is the result of my hobby which is unofficial bin inspections
strange you might think but if we could rely on corporations to tell us what they were doing in the back of their stores we wouldnt need to go sneaking around the back opening up bins and having a look at whats inside
but this is what you can see more or less on every street corner in britain in europe in north america
it represents a colossal waste of food but what i discovered whilst i was writing my book was that this very evident abundance of waste was actually the tip of the iceberg
when you start going up the supply chain you find where the real food waste is happening on a gargantuan scale
can i have a show of hands if you have a loaf of sliced bread in your house
who lives in a household where that crust that slice at the first and last end of each loaf who lives in a household where it does get eaten
okay most people not everyone but most people and this is im glad to say what i see across the world and yet has anyone seen a supermarket or sandwich shop anywhere in the world that serves sandwiches with crusts on it
i certainly havent
so i kept on thinking where do those crusts go
this is the answer unfortunately slices of fresh bread coming out of this one single factory every single day day fresh bread
in the same year that i visited this factory i went to pakistan where people in were going hungry as a result of a squeeze on global food supplies
we contribute to that squeeze by depositing food in bins here in britain and elsewhere in the world we take food off the market shelves that hungry people depend on
go one step up and you get to farmers who throw away sometimes a third or even more of their harvest because of cosmetic standards
this farmer for example has invested pounds in growing spinach not one leaf of which he harvested because there was a little bit of grass growing in amongst it
potatoes that are cosmetically imperfect all going for pigs
parsnips that are too small for supermarket specifications tomatoes in tenerife oranges in florida bananas in ecuador where i visited last year all being discarded this is one days waste from one banana plantation in ecuador
all being discarded perfectly edible because theyre the wrong shape or size
if we do that to fruit and vegetables you bet we can do it to animals too
liver lungs heads tails kidneys testicles all of these things which are traditional delicious and nutritious parts of our gastronomy go to waste offal consumption has halved in britain and america in the last years
as a result this stuff gets fed to dogs at best or is incinerated
this man in kashgar xinjiang province in western china is serving up his national dish
its called sheeps organs
its delicious its nutritious and as i learned when i went to kashgar it symbolizes their taboo against food waste
i was sitting in a roadside cafe
a chef came to talk to me i finished my bowl and halfway through the conversation he stopped talking and he started frowning into my bowl
i thought my goodness what taboo have i broken
how have i insulted my host
he pointed at three grains of rice at the bottom of my bowl and he said clean
i thought my god you know i go around the world telling people to stop wasting food
this guy has thrashed me at my own game
but it gave me faith it gave me faith that we the people do have the power to stop this tragic waste of resources if we regard it as socially unacceptable to waste food on a colossal scale if we make noise about it tell corporations about it tell governments we want to see an end to food waste we do have the power to bring about that change
fish to percent of european fish are discarded at sea they dont even get landed
in our homes weve lost touch with food
this is an experiment i did on three lettuces
who keeps lettuces in their fridge
most people the one on the left was kept in a fridge for days
the one in the middle on my kitchen table not much difference
the one on the right i treated like cut flowers
its a living organism cut the slice off stuck it in a vase of water it was all right for another two weeks after this
some food waste as i said at the beginning will inevitably arise so the question is what is the best thing to do with it
i answered that question when i was
in fact humans answered that question years ago we domesticated pigs to turn food waste back into food
and yet in europe that practice has become illegal since as a result of the foot and mouth outbreak
its unscientific its unnecessary
if you cook food for pigs just as if you cook food for humans it is rendered safe
its also a massive saving of resources
at the moment europe depends on importing millions of tons of soy from south america where its production contributes to global warming to deforestation to biodiversity loss to feed livestock here in europe
at the same time we throw away millions of tons of food waste which we could and should be feeding them
if we did that and fed it to pigs we would save that amount of carbon
if we feed our food waste which is the current government favorite way of getting rid of food waste to anaerobic digestion which turns food waste into gas to produce electricity you save a paltry kilograms of carbon dioxide per ton of food waste its much better to feed it to pigs
we knew that during the war
a silver lining it has kicked off globally the quest to tackle food waste
feeding the is an event i first organized in
we fed people all on food that otherwise would have been wasted
since then its happened again in london its happening internationally and across the country
its a way of organizations coming together to celebrate food to say the best thing to do with food is to eat and enjoy it and to stop wasting it
for the sake of the planet we live on for the sake of our children for the sake of all the other organisms that share our planet with us we are a terrestrial animal and we depend on our land for food at the moment we are trashing our land to grow food that no one eats
stop wasting food thank you very much

title james forbes compassion at the dinner table title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript join rev james forbes at the dinner table of his southern childhood where his mother and father taught him what compassion really means day to day sharing with those who need love description
compassion what does it look like
come with me to south bloodworth street in raleigh north carolina where i grew up
if you come in you will see us evening time at table set for ten but not always all seats filled at the point when dinner is ready to be served
since mom had eight kids sometimes she said she couldnt tell who was who and where they were
before we could eat she would ask are all the children in
and if someone happened to be missing we would have to we say fix a plate for that person put it in the oven then we could say grace and we could eat
also while we were at the table there was a ritual in our family when something significant had happened for any one of us whether mom had just been elected as the president of the pta or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent the ritual at the family was once the announcement is made we must take five ten minutes to do what we call make over that person that is to make a fuss over the one who had been honored in some way
for when one is honored all are honored
also we had to make a report on our extended visited members that is extended members of the family sick and elderly shut in
my task was at least once a week to visit mother lassiter who lived on east street mother williamson who lived on bledsoe avenue and mother lathers who lived on oberlin road
why because they were old and infirm and we needed to go by to see if they needed anything
for mom said to be family is to care and share and to look out for one another
they are our family
and of course sometimes there was a bonus for going
they would offer sweets or money
mom says if they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them you must always say nothing and if they insist say whatever you mind to give me this was the nature of being at that table
in fact she indicated that if we would do that not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude from the members of the extended family but she said even god will smile and when god smiles there is peace and justice and joy
so at the table at i learned something about compassion
of course it was a ministers family so we had to add god into it
and so i came to think that mama eternal mama eternal is always wondering are all the children in
and if we had been faithful in caring and sharing we had the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world
now it was not always wonderful at that table
let me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion
it was christmas and at our family oh what a morning
christmas morning where we open up our gifts where we have special prayers and where we get to the old upright piano and we would sing carols it was a very intimate moment
in fact you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed except that daddy messed it up
there was a member of his staff who did not have any place on that particular christmas to celebrate
and daddy brought elder revels to the christmas family celebration
we thought he must be out of his mind
this is our time this is intimate time
this is when we can just be who we are and now we have this stuffy brother with his shirt and tie on while we are still in our pjs
why would daddy bring elder revels
any other time but not to the christmas celebration
and mom overheard us and said well you know what if you really understand the nature of this celebration it is that this is a time where you extend the circle of love
thats what the celebration is all about
its time to make space to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community
so we sucked up
but growing up at compassion was not a word to be debated it was a sensibility to how we are together
we are sisters and brothers united together
and like chief seattle said we did not spin the web of life
were all strands in it
and whatever we do to the web we do to ourselves
now thats compassion
so let me tell you i kind of look at the world this way
i see pictures and something says now thats compassion
a harvested field of grain with some grain in the corners reminding me of the hebrew tradition that you may indeed harvest but you must always leave some on the edges just in case theres someone who has not had the share necessary for good nurture
talk about a picture of compassion
i see always it stirs my heart a picture of dr martin luther king jr
walking arm in arm with andy young and rabbi heschel and maybe thich nhat hanh and some of the other saints assembled walking across the bridge and going into selma
just a photograph
arm in arm for struggle
suffering together in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters without the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity robbing us of a sense of unity of being
so theres another picture here this one i really do like this picture
when dr martin luther king jr was assassinated that day everybody in my community was upset
you heard about riots all across the land
bobby kennedy was scheduled to bring an inner city message in indianapolis
this is the picture they said its going to be too volatile for you to go
he insisted i must go
so sitting on a flatbed truck the elders of the community are there and bobby stands up and says to the people i have bad news for you
some of you may not have heard that dr king has been assassinated
i know that you are angry and i know that you would almost wish to have the opportunity to enter now into activities of revenge but he said what i really want you to know is that i know how you feel
because i had someone dear to me snatched away
i know how you feel
and he said i hope that you will have the strength to do what i did
i allowed my anger my bitterness my grief to simmer a while and then i made up my mind that i was going to make a different world and we can do that together
thats a picture compassion i think i see it
i saw it when the dalai lama came to the riverside church while i was a pastor and he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world
he asked them to give a message and they each read in their own language a central affirmation and that was some version of the golden rule as you would that others would do unto you do also unto them
twelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire affirming one message
we are so connected that we must treat each other as if an action toward you is an action toward myself
one more picture while im stinking and thinking about the riverside church last night at chagrin fall a newspaperman and a television guy said that evening when a service was held at the riverside church we carried it on our station in this city
it was he said one of the most powerful moments of life together
we were all suffering
but you invited representatives of all of the traditions to come and you invited them
find out what it is in your tradition that tells us what to do when we have been humiliated when we have been despised and rejected and they all spoke out of their own traditions a word about the healing power of solidarity one with the other
i developed a sense of compassion sort of as second nature but i became a preacher
now as a preacher i got a job i got to preach the stuff but i got to do it too
or as father divine in harlem used to say to folks some people preach the gospel
i have to tangibilitate the gospel
so the real issue is how do you tangibilitate compassion
how do you make it real
my faith has constantly lifted up the ideal and challenged me when i fell beneath it
in my tradition there is a gift that we have made to other traditions to everybody around the world who knows the story of the good samaritan
many people think of it primarily in terms of charity random acts of kindness
but for those who really study that text a little more thoroughly you will discover that a question has been raised that leads to this parable
the question was what is the greatest commandment
and according to jesus the word comes forth you must love yourself you must love the lord your god with all your heart mind and soul and your neighbor as yourself
and then the person asked well what do you mean neighbor and he answered it by telling the story of the man who fell among thieves and how religious authorities went the other way and how their supporters in the congregation went the other way but an unsuspecting despised person came along saw the man in need provided oil and wine for his wounds put him on his own transportation and took him to the inn and asked the innkeeper take care of him
and he said here this is the initial investment but if needs continue make sure that you provide them
and whatever else is needed i will provide it and pay for it when i return
this always seemed to me to be a deepening of the sense of what it means to be a good samaritan
a good samaritan is not simply one whose heart is touched in an immediate act of care and charity but one who provides a system of sustained care i like that a system of sustained care in the inn take care
i think maybe its one time when the bible talks about a healthcare system and a commitment to do whatever is necessary that all gods children would have their needs cared for so that we could answer when mommy eternal asks in regards to health are all the children in and we could say yes
oh what a joy it has been to be a person seeking to tangibilitate compassion
i recall that my work as a pastor has always involved caring for their spiritual needs being concerned for housing for healthcare for the prisoners for the infirm for children even the foster care children for whom no one can even keep a record where they started off where they are going
to be a pastor is to care for these individual needs
but now to be a good samaritan and i always say and to be a good american for me is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care
compassion takes on a corporate dynamic
i believe that whatever we did around that table at bloodworth street must be done around tables and rituals of faith until we become that family that family together that understands the nature of our unity
we are one people together
so let me explain to you what i mean when i think about compassion and why i think it is so important that right at this point in history
we would decide to establish this charter of compassion
the reason its important is because this is a very special time in history
it is the time that biblically we would speak of as the day or the year of gods favor
this is a season of grace
unusual things are beginning to happen
please pardon me as a black man for celebrating that the election of obama was an unusual sign of the fact that it is a year of favor
and yet there is so much more that needs to be done
we need to bring health and food and education and respect for all gods citizens all gods children remembering mama eternal
now let me close my comments by telling you that whenever i feel something very deeply it usually takes the form of verse
and so i want to close with a little song
i close with this song its a childrens song because we are all children at the table of mama eternal
and if mama eternal has taught us correctly this song will make sense not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering but to all who sign the charter for compassion
and this is why we do it
the song says ♫ i made heaven so happy today ♫ ♫ receiving gods love and giving it away ♫ ♫ when i looked up heaven smiled at me ♫ ♫ now im so happy cant you see ♫ ♫ im happy look at me im happy cant you see ♫ ♫ sharing makes me happy makes heaven happy too ♫ ♫ im happy look at me im happy cant you see ♫ ♫ let me share my happy loving smile with you ♫ thats compassion

title jenna mccarthy what you dont know about marriage title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript in this funny casual talk from tedx writer jenna mccarthy shares surprising research on how marriages really work one tip do not try to win an oscar for best actress description
every year in the united states alone couples make a legal and spiritual decision to spend the rest of their lives together
and not to have sex with anyone else ever
he buys a ring she buys a dress
they go shopping for all sorts of things
she takes him to arthur murray for ballroom dancing lessons
and the big day comes
and theyll stand before god and family and some guy her dad once did business with and theyll vow that nothing not abject poverty not life threatening illness not complete and utter misery will ever put the tiniest damper on their eternal love and devotion
these optimistic young bastards promise to honor and cherish each other through hot flashes and mid life crises and a cumulative lb weight gain until that far off day when one of them is finally able to rest in peace
you know because they cant hear the snoring anymore
and then theyll get stupid drunk and smash cake in each others faces and do the macarena and well be there showering them with towels and toasters and drinking their free booze and throwing birdseed at them every single time even though we know statistically half of them will be divorced within a decade
of course the other half wont right
theyll keep forgetting anniversaries and arguing about where to spend holidays and debating which way the toilet paper should come off of the roll
and some of them will even still be enjoying each others company when neither of them can chew solid food anymore
and researchers want to know why
i mean look it doesnt take a double blind placebo controlled study to figure out what makes a marriage not work
disrespect boredom too much time on facebook having sex with other people
but you can have the exact opposite of all of those things respect excitement a broken internet connection mind numbing monogamy and the thing still can go to hell in a hand basket
so whats going on when it doesnt
what do the folks who make it all the way to side by side burial plots have in common
what are they doing right
what can we learn from them
and if youre still happily sleeping solo why should you stop what youre doing and make it your lifes work to find that one special person that you can annoy for the rest of your life
well researchers spend billions of your tax dollars trying to figure that out
they stalk blissful couples and they study their every move and mannerism
and they try to pinpoint what it is that sets them apart from their miserable neighbors and friends
and it turns out the success stories share a few similarities actually beyond they dont have sex with other people
for instance in the happiest marriages the wife is thinner and better looking than the husband
obvious right
its obvious that this leads to marital bliss because women we care a great deal about being thin and good looking whereas men mostly care about sex
ideally with women who are thinner and better looking than they are
the beauty of this research though is that no one is suggesting that women have to be thin to be happy we just have to be thinner than our partners
so instead of all that laborious dieting and exercising we just need to wait for them to get fat maybe bake a few pies
this is good information to have and its not that complicated
research also suggests that the happiest couples are the ones that focus on the positives
for example the happy wife
instead of pointing out her husbands growing gut or suggesting he go for a run she might say wow honey thank you for going out of your way to make me relatively thinner
these are couples who can find good in any situation
yeah it was devastating when we lost everything in that fire but its kind of nice sleeping out here under the stars and its a good thing youve got all that body fat to keep us warm
one of my favorite studies found that the more willing a husband is to do house work the more attractive his wife will find him
because we needed a study to tell us this
but heres whats going on here
the more attractive she finds him the more sex they have the more sex they have the nicer he is to her the nicer he is to her the less she nags him about leaving wet towels on the bed and ultimately they live happily ever after
in other words men you might want to pick it up a notch in the domestic department
heres an interesting one
one study found that people who smile in childhood photographs are less likely to get a divorce
this is an actual study and let me clarify
the researchers were not looking at documented self reports of childhood happiness or even studying old journals
the data were based entirely on whether people looked happy in these early pictures
now i dont know how old all of you are but when i was a kid your parents took pictures with a special kind of camera that held something called film and by god film was expensive
they didnt take shots of you in that rapid fire digital video mode and then pick out the nicest smileyest one for the christmas card
oh no
they dressed you up they lined you up and you smiled for the fucking camera like they told you to or you could kiss your birthday party goodbye
but still i have a huge pile of fake happy childhood pictures and im glad they make me less likely than some people to get a divorce
so what else can you do to safeguard your marriage
do not win an oscar for best actress
im serious
bettie davis joan crawford hallie berry hillary swank sandra bullock reese witherspoon all of them single soon after taking home that statue
they actually call it the oscar curse
it is the marriage kiss of death and something that should be avoided
and its not just successfully starring in films thats dangerous
it turns out merely watching a romantic comedy causes relationship satisfaction to plummet
apparently the bitter realization that maybe it could happen to us but it obviously hasnt and it probably never will makes our lives seem unbearably grim in comparison
and theoretically i suppose if we opt for a film where someone gets brutally murdered or dies in a fiery car crash we are more likely to walk out of that theater feeling like weve got it pretty good
drinking alcohol it seems is bad for your marriage
yeah
i cant tell you anymore about that one because i stopped reading it at the headline
but heres a scary one divorce is contagious
thats right when you have a close couple friend split up it increases your chances of getting a divorce by percent
now i have to say i dont get this one at all
my husband and i have watched quite a few friends divide their assets and then struggle with being our age and single in an age of sexting and viagra and eharmony
and im thinking theyve done more for my marriage than a lifetime of therapy ever could
so now you may be wondering why does anyone get married ever
well the u s federal government counts more than a thousand legal benefits to being someones spouse a list that includes visitation rights in jail but hopefully youll never need that one
but beyond the profound federal perks married people make more money
were healthier physically and emotionally
we produce happier more stable and more successful kids
we have more sex than our supposedly swinging single friends believe it or not
we even live longer which is a pretty compelling argument for marrying someone you like a lot in the first place
now if youre not currently experiencing the joy of the joint tax return i cant tell you how to find a chore loving person of the approximately ideal size and attractiveness who prefers horror movies and doesnt have a lot of friends hovering on the brink of divorce but i can only encourage you to try because the benefits as ive pointed out are significant
the bottom line is whether youre in it or youre searching for it i believe marriage is an institution worth pursuing and protecting
so i hope youll use the information ive given you today to weigh your personal strengths against your own risk factors
for instance in my marriage id say im doing okay
one the one hand i have a husband whos annoyingly lean and incredibly handsome
so im obviously going to need fatten him up
and like i said we have those divorced friends who may secretly or subconsciously be trying to break us up
so we have to keep an eye on that
and we do like a cocktail or two
on the other hand i have the fake happy picture thing
and also my husband does a lot around the house and would happily never see another romantic comedy as long as he lives
so ive got all those things going for me
but just in case i plan to work extra hard to not win an oscar anytime soon
and for the good of your relationships i would encourage you to do the same
ill see you at the bar

title john maeda how art technology and design inform creative leaders title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript john maeda former president of the rhode island school of design delivers a funny and charming talk that spans a lifetime of work in art design and technology concluding with a picture of creative leadership in the future watch for demos of maeda s earliest work and even a computer made of people description
i have to say that im very glad to be here
i understand we have over countries here so thats a whole new paradigm for me to speak to all of these countries
in each country im sure you have this thing called the parent teacher conference
do you know about the parent teacher conference
not the ones for your kids but the one you had as a child where your parents come to school and your teacher talks to your parents and its a little bit awkward
well i remember in third grade i had this moment where my father who never takes off from work hes a classical blue collar a working class immigrant person going to school to see his son how hes doing and the teacher said to him he said you know john is good at math and art
and he kind of nodded you know
the next day i saw him talking to a customer at our tofu store and he said you know johns good at math
and that always stuck with me all my life
why didnt dad say art why wasnt it okay
why it became a question my entire life and thats all right because being good at math meant he bought me a computer and some of you remember this computer this was my first computer
who had an apple ii apple ii users very cool
as you remember the apple ii did nothing at all
youd plug it in youd type in it and green text would come out
it would say youre wrong most of the time
that was the computer we knew
that computer is a computer that i learned about going to mit my fathers dream and at mit however i learned about the computer at all levels and after i went to art school to get away from computers and i began to think about the computer as more of a spiritual space of thinking
and i was influenced by performance art so this is years ago i made a computer out of people
it was called the human powered computer experiment
i have a power manager mouse driver memory etc and i built this in kyoto the old capital of japan
its a room broken in two halves
ive turned the computer on and these assistants are placing a giant floppy disk built out of cardboard and its put into the computer
and the floppy disk drive person wears it
she finds the first sector on the disk and takes data off the disk and passes it off to of course the bus
so the bus diligently carries the data into the computer to the memory to the cpu the vram etc and its an actual working computer thats a bus really
and it looks kind of fast thats a mouse driver where its xy
it looks like its happening kind of quickly but its actually a very slow computer and when i realized how slow this computer was compared to how fast a computer is it made me wonder about computers and technology in general
and so im going to talk today about four things really
the first three things are about how ive been curious about technology design and art and how they intersect how they overlap and also a topic that ive taken on since four years ago i became the president and ill talk about how ive looked to combine these four areas into a kind of a synthesis a kind of experiment
so starting from technology technology is a wonderful thing
when that apple ii came out it really could do nothing
it could show text and after we waited a bit we had these things called images
remember when images were first possible with a computer those gorgeous full color images
and then after a few years we got cd quality sound
it was incredible you could listen to sound on the computer
and then movies via cd rom it was amazing
remember that excitement
and then the browser appeared the browser was great but the browser was very primitive very narrow bandwidth
text first then images we waited cd quality sound over the net then movies over the internet kind of incredible
and then the mobile phone occurred text images audio video and now we have iphone ipad android with text video audio etc
you see this little pattern here
were kind of stuck in a loop perhaps and this sense of possibility from computing is something ive been questioning for the last or so years and have looked to design as we understand most things and to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine
and i have a small experiment to give you a quick design lesson
designers talk about the relationship between form and content content and form now what does that mean
well content is the word up there fear
its a four letter word its a kind of a bad feeling word fear
fear is set in light helvetica so its not too stressful and if you set it in ultra light helvetica its like oh fear who cares right
you take the same ultra light helvetica and make it big and like whoa that hurts fear
so you can see how you change the scale you change the form content is the same but you feel differently
you change the typeface to like this typeface and its kind of funny its like pirate typeface like captain jack sparrow typeface arr fear
like aww thats not fearful thats actually funny
or fear like this kind of a nightclub typeface
like we gotta go to fear
its like amazing right
it just changes the same content
or you make it the letters are separated apart theyre huddled together like on the deck of the titanic and you feel sorry for the letters like i feel the fear
you feel for them
or you change the typeface to something like this
its very classy its like that expensive restaurant fear
i can never get in there
its just amazing fear but thats form content
if you just change one letter in that content you get a much better word much better content free
free is a great word you can serve it almost any way
free bold feels like mandela free
its like yes i can be free
free even light feels kind of like ah i can breathe in free
it feels great or even free spread out its like ah i can breathe in free so easily
and i can add in a blue gradient and a dove and i have like don draper free
so you see that form content design it works that way
its a powerful thing its like magic almost like the magicians weve seen at ted its magic
design does that
and ive been curious about how design and technology intersect and im going to show you some old work i never really show anymore to give you a sense of what i used to do
so yeah
so i made a lot of work in the
this was a square that responds to sound
people ask me why i made that its not clear
but i thought itd be neat for the square to respond to me and my kids were small then and my kids would play with these things like aaah you know they would say daddy aaah aaah you know like that
wed go to a computer store and theyd do the same thing
and theyd say daddy why doesnt the computer respond to sound
and it was really at the time i was wondering why doesnt the computer respond to sound
so i made this as a kind of an experiment at the time
and then i spent a lot of time in the space of interactive graphics and things like this and i stopped doing it because my students at mit got so much better than myself so i had to hang up my mouse
but in i made my last piece it was in black and white monochrome fully monochrome all in integer mathematics
its called tap type write
its paying a tribute to the wonderful typewriter that my mother used to type on all the time as a legal secretary
it has variations
theres a shift
ten variations this is like spin the letter around
this is like a ring of letters
this is years old so its kind of a lets see this is i love the french film the red balloon
great movie right i love that movie so this is sort of like a play on that
its peaceful like that
ill show this last one this is about balance you know
its kind of stressful typing out so if you type on this keyboard you can like balance it out
if you hit g lifes okay so i always say hit g and its going to be all right
thank you
thank you
so that was years ago and i was always on the periphery of art
by being president of risd ive gone deep into art and art is a wonderful thing fine art pure art
you know when people say i dont get art
i dont get it at all that means art is working you know
its like art is supposed to be enigmatic so when you say like i dont get it like oh thats great
art does that because art is about asking questions questions that may not be answerable
at risd we have this amazing facility called the edna lawrence nature lab it has samples of animal bone mineral plants
you know in rhode island if an animal gets hit on the road they call us up and we pick it up and stuff it
and why do we have this facility
because at risd you have to look at the actual animal the object to understand its volume to perceive it
at risd youre not allowed to draw from an image
and many people ask me john couldnt you just digitize all this make it all digital wouldnt it be better
and i often say well theres something good to how things used to be done theres something very different about it something we should figure out what is good about how we did it even in this new era
and i have a good friend hes a new media artist named tota hasegawa hes based in london no actually its in tokyo but when he was based in london he had a game with his wife he would go to antique shops and the game was as such when we look at an antique we want well ask the shopkeeper for the story behind the antique and if its a good story well buy it
so theyd go to an antique shop and theyd look at this cup and theyd say tell us about this cup
and the shopkeeper would say its old
tell us more oh its really old
and he saw over and over the antiques value was all about it being old
and as a new media artist he reflected and said you know ive spent my whole career making new media art
people say wow your art what is it its new media
and he realized it isnt about old or new
its about something in between
it isnt about old the dirt new the cloud its about what is good
a combination of the cloud and the dirt is where the action is at
you see it in all interesting art today in all interesting businesses today how we combine those two together to make good is very interesting
so art makes questions and leadership is something that is asking a lot of questions
we arent functioning so easily anymore
we arent a simple authoritarian regime anymore
as an example of authoritarianism i was in russia one time traveling in st petersburg at a national monument and i saw this sign that says do not walk on the grass and i thought oh i mean i speak english and youre trying to single me out thats not fair
but i found a sign for russian speaking people and it was the best sign ever to say no
it was like no swimming no hiking no anything
my favorite ones are no plants why would you bring a plant to a national monument im not sure
and also no love
so that is authoritarianism
and what is that structurally
its a hierarchy we all know that a hierarchy is how we run many systems today but as we know its been disrupted
it is now a network instead of a perfect tree
its a heterarchy instead of a hierarchy and thats kind of awkward
and so today leaders are faced with how to lead differently i believe
this is work i did with my colleague becky bermont on creative leadership what can we learn from artists and designers for how to lead
because in many senses a regular leader loves to avoid mistakes
someone whos creative actually loves to learn from mistakes
a traditional leader is always wanting to be right whereas a creative leader hopes to be right
and this frame is important today in this complex ambiguous space and artists and designers have a lot to teach us i believe
and i had a show in london recently where my friends invited me to come to london for four days to sit in a sandbox and i said great
and so i sat in a sandbox for four days straight six hours every day six minute appointments with anyone in london and that was really bad
but i would listen to people hear their issues draw in the sand try to figure things out and it was kind of hard to figure out what i was doing
you know its all these one on one meetings for like four days
and it felt kind of like being president actually
i was like oh this my job president i do a lot of meetings you know
and by the end of the experience i realized why i was doing this
its because leaders what we do is we connect improbable connections and hope something will happen and in that room i found so many connections between people across all of london and so leadership connecting people is the great question today
whether youre in the hierarchy or the heterarchy its a wonderful design challenge
and one thing ive been doing is doing some research on systems that can combine technology and leadership with an art and design perspective
let me show you something i havent shown anywhere actually
so what this is is a kind of a sketch an application sketch i wrote in python you know how theres photoshop
this is called powershop and the way it works is imagine an organization you know the ceo isnt ever at the top the ceos at the center of the organization
there may be different subdivisions in the organization and you might want to look into different areas for instance green are areas doing well red are areas doing poorly
you know how do you as the leader scan connect make things happen so for instance you might open up a distribution here and find the different subdivisions in there and know that you know someone in eco over here and these people here are in eco the people you might engage with as ceo people going across the hierarchy
and part of the challenge of the ceo is to find connections across areas and so you might look in r amp d and here you see one person who crosses the two areas of interest and its a person important to engage
so you might want to for instance get a heads up display on how youre interacting with them
how many coffees do you have
how often are you calling them emailing them
what is the tenor of their email how is it working out
leaders might be able to use these systems to better regulate how they work inside the heterarchy
you can also imagine using technology like from luminoso the guys from cambridge who were looking at deep text analysis what is the tenor of your communications
so these kind of systems i believe are important
theyre targeted social media systems around leaders
and i believe that this kind of perspective will only begin to grow as more leaders enter the space of art and design because art and design lets you think like this find different systems like this and ive just begun thinking like this so im glad to share that with you
so in closing i want to thank all of you for your attention thanks very much

title emiliano salinas a civil response to violence title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript in this passionate talk thats already caused a sensation in mexico emiliano salinas son of former president carlos salinas de gortari confronts the current climate of violence in mexico or rather how mexican society responds to it he calls on ordinary citizens to move from denial and fear to peaceful community based action description
my name is emiliano salinas and im going to talk about the role we members of society play in the violent atmosphere this country is living in right now
i was born in
i grew up in a traditional mexican family
as a child i had a pretty normal life i would go to school play with my friends and cousins
but then my father became president of mexico and my life changed
what im about to say at least some of what im about to say will cause controversy
firstly because im the one whos going to say it
and secondly because what im going to say is true and it will make a lot of people nervous because its something we dont want to hear
but its imperative that we listen because its undeniable and definitive
it will also make members of criminal organizations nervous for the same reasons
im going to talk about the role we members of society play in this phenomenon and about four different response levels we citizens have against violence
i know many will find it difficult to separate the fact that im carlos salinas de gortaris son from the fact that im a citizen concerned about the countrys current situation
dont worry
its not necessary for understanding the importance of what im going to say
i think we have a problem in mexico
we have a big problem
i think theres consensus on this
no one argues we all agree theres a problem
what we dont agree on is what the problem actually is
is it the zetas the drug traffickers the government
corruption poverty or is it something else
i think none of these is the problem
i dont mean they dont deserve attention
but we wont be able to take care of any of those things if we dont solve the real problem we have in mexico first
the real problem we have is most of us mexicans we believe we are victims of our circumstances
we are a country of victims
historically weve always acted as victims of something or somebody
we were victims of the spaniards
then we were victims of the french
then we were victims of don porfirio
then we were victims of the pri
even of salinas
and of el peje
and now of the zetas and the traffickers and the criminals and the kidnappers
hold on wait a minute
what if none of these things is the problem
the problem is not the things we feel victims of
the problem is that we play the role of victims
we need to open our eyes and see that we are not victims
if only we stopped feeling like victims if we stopped acting as victims our country would change so much
im going to talk about how to go from a society that acts as a victim of circumstances to a responsible involved society that takes the future of its country in its own hands
im going to talk about four different levels of civil response against violence from weakest to strongest
the first level the weakest level of civil response against violence is denial and apathy
today much of mexican society is in denial of the situation were going through
we want to go on with our daily life even though we are not living under normal circumstances
daily life in our country is to say the least under extraordinary exceptional circumstances
its like someone who has a serious illness and pretends its the flu and it will just go away
we want to pretend that mexico has the flu
but it doesnt
mexico has cancer
and if we dont do something about it the cancer will end up killing it
we need to move mexican society from denial and apathy to the next level of citizen response which is effectively recognition
and that recognition will sow fear recognizing the seriousness of the situation
but fear is better than apathy because fear makes us do something
many people in mexico are afraid today
were very afraid
and were acting out of that fear
and let me tell you what the problem is with acting out of fear and this is the second level of civil response fear
lets think about mexican streets theyre unsafe because of violence so people stay at home
does that make streets more or less safe
less safe
so streets become more desolate and unsafe so we stay home more which makes streets even more desolate and unsafe and we stay home even more
this vicious circle ends up with the whole population stuck inside their houses scared to death even more afraid than when we were out on the streets
we need to confront this fear
we need to move mexican society the members of society who are at this level to the next level which is action
we need to face our fears and take back our streets our cities our neighborhoods
for many people acting involves courage
we go from fear to courage
they say i cant take it anymore
lets do something about it
recently this is a sensitive figure public lynchings have been recorded so far in in mexico
usually its one or two a year
now were experiencing one every week
this shows that society is desperate and its taking the law into its own hands
unfortunately violent action though action is better than no action but taking part in it only disguises violence
if im violent with you and you respond with violence you become part of the violence and you just disguise my violence
so civil action is vital but its also vital to take people who are at the level of courage and violent action to the next level which is non violent action
its pacific coordinated civil action which doesnt mean passive action
it means its determined and effective but not violent
there are examples of this kind of action in mexico
two years ago in galena city chihuahua a member of the community was kidnapped eric le barón
his brothers benjamín and julián got together with the rest of the community to think of the best course of action to pay the ransom to take up arms and go after the kidnappers or to ask the government for help
in the end benjamín and julián decided the best thing they could do was to organize the community and act together
so what did they do
they mobilized the whole community of le barón to go to chihuahua where they organized a sit in in the central park of the city
they sent a message to the kidnappers if you want your ransom come and get it
well be waiting for you right here
they stayed there
seven days later eric was set free and was able to return home
this is an example of what an organized society can do a society that acts
of course criminals can respond
and in this case they did
on july benjamín le barón was murdered
but julián le barón keeps working and he has been mobilizing communities in chihuahua for over a year
and for over a year he has known that a price has been put on his head
but he keeps fighting
he keeps organizing
he keeps mobilizing
these heroic acts are present all over the country
with a thousand juliáns working together mexico would be a very different country
and theyre out there
they just have to raise their hands
i was born in mexico i grew up in mexico and along the way i learned to love mexico
i think anyone who has stepped foot on this land not to mention all mexican people will agree that its not difficult to love mexico
ive traveled a lot and nowhere else have i found the passion mexicans have
that devotion we feel for the national football team
that devotion we show in helping victims of disasters such as the earthquake in or this years floods
the passion with which weve been singing the national anthem since we were kids
when we thought masiosare was the strange enemy and we sang with a childlike heart a soldier in each son
i think the biggest insult the worst way you can offend a mexican is to insult their mother
a mother is the most sacred thing in life
mexico is our mother and today she cries out for her children
we are going through the darkest moment in our recent history
our mother mexico is being violated before our very eyes
what are we going to do
masiosare the strange enemy is here
where is the soldier in each son
mahatma gandhi one of the greatest civil fighters of all time said be the change you wish to see in the world
today in mexico were asking for gandhis
we need gandhis
we need men and women who love mexico and who are willing to take action
this is a call for every true mexican to join this initiative
this is a call so that every single thing we love about mexico the festivals the markets the restaurants the cantinas the tequila the mariachis the serenades the posadas el grito the day of the dead san miguel the joy the passion for life the fight and everything it means to be mexican doesnt disappear from this world
were facing a very powerful opponent
but we are many more
they can take a mans life
anyone can kill me or you or you
but no one can kill the spirit of true mexicans
the battle is won but we still have to fight it
years ago the roman poet juvenal said something that today echoes in the heart of every true mexican
he said count it the greatest sin to prefer life to honor and for the sake of living to lose what makes life worth living
thank you

title evelyn glennie how to truly listen title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript in this soaring demonstration deaf percussionist evelyn glennie illustrates how listening to music involves much more than simply letting sound waves hit your eardrums description
im not quite sure whether i really want to see a snare drum at nine oclock or so in the morning
but anyway its just great to see such a full theater and really i must thank herbie hancock and his colleagues for such a great presentation
one of the interesting things of course is the combination of that raw hand on the instrument and technology and of course what he said about listening to our young people
of course my job is all about listening and my aim really is to teach the world to listen
thats my only real aim in life
and it sounds quite simple but actually its quite a big big job
because you know when you look at a piece of music for example if i just open my little motorbike bag we have here hopefully a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page
and you know we open it up and i read the music
so technically i can actually read this
i will follow the instructions the tempo markings the dynamics
i will do exactly as im told
and so therefore because time is short if i just play you literally the first maybe two lines or so its very straightforward
theres nothing too difficult about the piece
but here im being told that the piece of music is very quick
im being told where to play on the drum
im being told which part of the stick to use
and im being told the dynamic
and im also being told that the drum is without snares
snares on snares off
so therefore if i translate this piece of music we have this idea
and so on my career would probably last about five years
however what i have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music
everything that there isnt time to learn from a teacher or to talk about even from a teacher
but its the things that you notice when youre not actually with your instrument that in fact become so interesting and that you want to explore through this tiny tiny surface of a drum
so there we experience the translation now well experience the interpretation
now my career may last a little longer
but in a way you know its the same if i look at you and i see a nice bright young lady with a pink top on
i see that youre clutching a teddy bear etc etc
so i get a basic idea as to what you might be about what you might like what you might do as a profession etc etc
however thats just you know the initial idea i may have that we all get when we actually look and we try to interpret but actually its so unbelievably shallow
in the same way i look at the music i get a basic idea i wonder what technically might be hard or you know what i want to do
just the basic feeling
however that is simply not enough
and i think what herbie said please listen listen
we have to listen to ourselves first of all
if i play for example holding the stick where literally i do not let go of the stick youll experience quite a lot of shock coming up through the arm
and you feel really quite believe it or not detached from the instrument and from the stick even though im actually holding the stick quite tightly
by holding it tightly i feel strangely more detached
if i just simply let go and allow my hand my arm to be more of a support system suddenly i have more dynamic with less effort much more
and i just feel at last one with the stick and one with the drum
and im doing far far less
so in the same way that i need time with this instrument i need time with people in order to interpret them
not just translate them but interpret them
if for example i play just a few bars of a piece of music for which i think of myself as a technician that is someone who is basically a percussion player
and so on if i think of myself as a musician
and so on there is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just thinking about
and i remember when i was years old and i started playing tympani and percussion and my teacher said well how are we going to do this you know music is about listening
and i said yes i agree with that so whats the problem
and he said well how are you going to hear this how are you going to hear that
and i said well how do you hear it
he said well i think i hear it through here
and i said well i think i do too but i also hear it through my hands through my arms cheekbones my scalp my tummy my chest my legs and so on
and so we began our lessons every single time tuning drums in particular the kettle drums or tympani to such a narrow pitch interval so something like
that of a difference then gradually and gradually
and its amazing that when you do open your body up and open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through that in fact the tiny tiny difference
can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger there
and so what we would do is that i would put my hands on the wall of the music room and together we would listen to the sounds of the instruments and really try to connect with those sounds far far more broadly than simply depending on the ear
because of course the ear is i mean subject to all sorts of things
the room we happen to be in the amplification the quality of the instrument the type of sticks etc etc
theyre all different
same amount of weight but different sound colors
and thats basically what we are were just human beings but we all have our own little sound colors as it were that make up these extraordinary personalities and characters and interests and things
and as i grew older i then auditioned for the royal academy of music in london and they said well no we wont accept you because we havent a clue you know of the future of a so called deaf musician
and i just couldnt quite accept that
and so therefore i said to them well look if you refuse if you refuse me through those reasons as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love the art of creating sound then we have to think very very hard about the people you do actually accept
and as a result once we got over a little hurdle and having to audition twice they accepted me and not only that what had happened was that it changed the whole role of the music institutions throughout the united kingdom
under no circumstances were they to refuse any application whatsoever on the basis of whether someone had no arms no legs they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand
no circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry
and every single entry had to be listened to experienced and then based on the musical ability then that person could either enter or not
so therefore this in turn meant that there was an extremely interesting bunch of students who arrived in these various music institutions
and i have to say many of them now in the professional orchestras throughout the world
the interesting thing about this as well though is quite simply that not only were people connected with sound which is basically all of us and we well know that music really is our daily medicine
i say music but actually i mean sound
because you know some of the extraordinary things ive experienced as a musician when you may have a year old lad who has got the most incredible challenges who may not be able to control his movements who may be deaf who may be blind etc etc suddenly if that young lad sits close to this instrument and perhaps even lies underneath the marimba and you play something thats so incredibly organ like almost i dont really have the right sticks perhaps but something like this let me change
something thats so unbelievably simple but he would be experiencing something that i wouldnt be because im on top of the sound
i have the sound coming this way
he would have the sound coming through the resonators
if there were no resonators on here we would have
so he would have a fullness of sound that those of you in the front few rows wouldnt experience those of you in the back few rows wouldnt experience either
every single one of us depending on where were sitting will experience this sound quite quite differently
and of course being the participator of the sound and that is starting from the idea of what type of sound i want to produce for example this sound
can you hear anything
exactly because im not even touching it
but yet we get the sensation of something happening
in the same way that when i see tree moves then i imagine that tree making a rustling sound
do you see what i mean
whatever the eye sees then theres always sound happening
so theres always always that huge i mean just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from
so all of my performances are based on entirely what i experience and not by learning a piece of music putting on someone elses interpretation of it buying all the cds possible of that particular piece of music and so on and so forth
because that isnt giving me enough of something that is so raw and so basic and something that i can fully experience the journey of
so it may be that in certain halls this dynamic may well work
it may be that in other halls theyre simply not going to experience that at all and so therefore my level of soft gentle playing may have to be
do you see what i mean so because of this explosion in access to sound especially through the deaf community this has not only affected how music institutions how schools for the deaf treat sound and not just as a means of therapy although of course being a participator of music that definitely is the case as well
but its meant that acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls they put together there are so few halls in this world that actually have very good acoustics dare i say but by that i mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine
the tiniest softest softest sound to something that is so broad so huge so incredible theres always something it may sound good up there may not be so good there
may be great there but terrible up there
maybe terrible over there but not too bad there etc etc
so to find an actual hall is incredible for which you can play exactly what you imagine without it being cosmetically enhanced
and so therefore acousticians are actually in conversation with people who are hearing impaired and who are participators of sound
and this is quite interesting
i cannot you know give you any detail as far as what is actually happening with those halls but its just the fact that they are going to a group of people for whom so many years weve been saying well how on earth can they experience music you know theyre deaf
we just we go like that and we imagine that thats what deafness is about
or we go like that and we imagine thats what blindness is about
if we see someone in a wheelchair we assume they cannot walk
it may be that they can walk three four five steps that to them means they can walk
in a years time it could be two extra steps
in another years time three extra steps
those are hugely important aspects to think about
so when we do listen to each other its unbelievably important for us to really test our listening skills to really use our bodies as a resonating chamber to stop the judgment
for me as a musician who deals with percent of new music its very easy for me to say oh yes i like that piece
oh no i dont like that piece and so on
and you know i just find that i have to give those pieces of music real time
it may be that the chemistry isnt quite right between myself and that particular piece of music but that doesnt mean i have the right to say its a bad piece of music
and you know its just one of the great things about being a musician is that it is so unbelievably fluid
so there are no rules no right no wrong this way that way
if i asked you to clap maybe i can do this
if i can just say please clap and create the sound of thunder
im assuming weve all experienced thunder
now i dont mean just the sound i mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves
and please try to create that through your clapping try just please try
very good snow snow have you ever heard snow
audience no
evelyn glennie well then stop clapping try again
try again snow
see youre awake
rain not bad not bad
you know the interesting thing here though is that i asked a group of kids not so long ago exactly the same question
now great imagination thank you very much
however not one of you got out of your seats to think right how can i clap ok maybe
maybe i can use my jewelry to create extra sounds
maybe i can use the other parts of my body to create extra sounds
not a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way other than sitting in your seats there and using two hands
in the same way that when we listen to music we assume that its all being fed through here
this is how we experience music of course its not
we experience thunder thunder thunder think think think
listen listen listen now what can we do with thunder
i remember my teacher when i first started my very first lesson i was all prepared with sticks ready to go
and instead of him saying ok evelyn please feet slightly apart arms at a more or less degree angle sticks in a more or less v shape keep this amount of space here etc
please keep your back straight etc etc etc where i was probably just going to end up absolutely rigid frozen and i would not be able to strike the drum because i was thinking of so many other things he said evelyn take this drum away for seven days and ill see you next week
so heavens what was i to do i no longer required the sticks i wasnt allowed to have these sticks
i had to basically look at this particular drum see how it was made what these little lugs did what the snares did
turned it upside down experimented with the shell experimented with the head
experimented with my body experimented with jewelry experimented with all sorts of things
and of course i returned with all sorts of bruises and things like that but nevertheless it was such an unbelievable experience because then where on earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music
where on earth are you going to experience that in a study book
so we never ever dealt with actual study books
so for example one of the things that we learn when we are dealing with being a percussion player as opposed to a musician is basically straightforward single stroke rolls
like that and then we get a little faster and a little faster and a little faster
and so on and so forth what does this piece require
single stroke rolls so why cant i then do that whilst learning a piece of music
and thats exactly what he did
and interestingly the older i became and when i became a full time student at a so called music institution all of that went out of the window
we had to study from study books
and constantly the question well why why what is this relating to
i need to play a piece of music oh well this will help your control
well how why do i need to learn that i need to relate it to a piece of music
you know i need to say something
why am i practicing paradiddles
is it just literally for control for hand stick control why am i doing that
i need to have the reason and the reason has to be by saying something through the music
and by saying something through music which basically is sound we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people
but i dont want to take responsibility of your emotional baggage
thats up to you when you walk through a hall
because that then determines what and how we listen to certain things
i may feel sorrowful or happy or exhilarated or angry when i play certain pieces of music but im not necessarily wanting you to feel exactly the same thing
so please the next time you go to a concert just allow your body to open up allow your body to be this resonating chamber
be aware that youre not going to experience the same thing as the performer is
the performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound because theyre hearing the contact of the stick on the drum or the mallet on the bit of wood or the bow on the string etc or the breath thats creating the sound from wind and brass
theyre experiencing that rawness there
but yet theyre experiencing something so unbelievably pure which is before the sound is actually happening
please take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike or breath is being pulled just experience the whole journey of that sound in the same way that i wished id experienced the whole journey of this particular conference rather than just arriving last night
but i hope maybe we can share one or two things as the day progresses
but thank you very much for having me

title adam sadowsky how to engineer a viral music video title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript the band ok go dreamed up the idea of a massive rube goldberg machine for their next music video and adam sadowskys team was charged with building it he tells the story of the effort and engineering behind their labyrinthine creation that quickly became the youtube sensation this too shall pass description
hi there
im going to be talking a little bit about music machines and life
or more specifically what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine for a music video
some of you may recognize this image
this is the opening frame of the video that we created
well be showing the video at the end but before we do i want to talk a little bit about what it is that they wanted
now when we first started talking to ok go the name of the song is this too shall pass we were really excited because they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with
and we were very excited about this because of course they have a history of dancing with machines
theyre responsible for this video here it goes again
million plus views on youtube
four guys dancing on treadmills no cuts just a static camera
a fantastically viral and wonderful video
so we were really excited about working with them
and we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted
and they explained that they wanted kind of a rube goldberg machine
now for those of you who dont know a rube goldberg machine is a complicated contraption an incredibly over engineered piece of machinery that accomplishes a relatively simple task
so we were excited by this idea and we started talking about exactly what it would look like
and we came up with some parameters because you know building a rube goldberg machine has limitations but it also is pretty wide open
and we wanted to make sure that we did something that would work for a music video
so we came up with a list of requirements the commandments and they were in order of ascending difficulty the first is no magic
everything that happened on screen had to be very easily understood by a typical viewer
the rule of thumb was that if my mother couldnt understand it then we couldnt use it in the video
they wanted band integration that is the machine acting upon the band members specifically not the other way around
they wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling
so as the song picks up emotion so should the machine get grander in its process
they wanted us to make use of the space
so we have this square foot warehouse we were using divided between two floors
it included an exterior loading dock
we used all of that including a giant hole in the floor that we actually descended the camera and cameraman through
they wanted it messy and we were happy to oblige
the machine itself would start the music
so the machine would get started it would travel some distance reacting along the way hit play on an ipod or a tape deck or something that would start playback
and the machine would maintain synchronization throughout
and speaking of synchronization they wanted it to sync to the rhythm and to hit specific beats along the way
okay
they wanted it to end precisely on time
okay so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect
and they wanted the music to drop out at a certain point in the video and actual live audio from the machine to play part of the song
and as if that wasnt enough all of these incredibly complicating things right they wanted it in one shot
okay
so just some statistics about what we went through in the process
the machine itself has distinct interactions
it took us takes to get it on film to our satisfaction
of those takes only three actually successfully completed their run
we destroyed two pianos and televisions in the process
we went to home depot well over a hundred times
and we lost one high heeled shoe when one of our engineers heather knight left her high heeled shoe after a nice dinner and returned back to the build and left it in a pile of stuff
and another engineer thought well that would be a really good thing to use and ended up using it as a really nice trigger
and its actually in the machine
so what did we learn from all of this
well having completed this we have the opportunity to step back and reflect on some of the things
and we learned that small stuff stinks
little balls in wooden tracks are really susceptible to humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust and they fall out of the tracks the exact angles makes it hard to get right
and yet a bowling ball will always follow the same path
it doesnt matter what temperature it is doesnt matter whats in its way it will pretty much get where it needs to go
but as much as the small stuff stinks we needed somewhere to start so that we would have somewhere to go
and so you have to start with it you have to focus on it
small stuff stinks but of course its essential right
what else planning is incredibly important
you know we spent a lot of time ideating and even building some of these things
its been said that no battle plan survives contact with the enemy
i think our enemy was physics and shes a cruel mistress
often we had to pull things out as a result because of timing or aesthetics or whatever
and so while planning is important so is flexibility
these are all things that ended up not making it into the final machine
so also put reliable stuff last the stuff thats going to run every time
again small to large is relevant here
the little lego car in the beginning of the video references the big real car near the end of the video
the big real car works every time theres no problem about it
the little one had a tendency to try to run off the track and thats a problem
but you dont want to have to reset the whole machine because the lego car at the end doesnt work right
so you put that up front so that if it fails at least you know you dont have to reset the whole thing
life can be messy
there were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing
months were spent in this tiny cold warehouse
and the wonderful elation that we had when we finally completed it
so its important to remember that whether its good or its bad this too shall pass
thank you very much
and now to introduce their music video we have ok go
ok go an introduction hello tedxusc
we are ok go
what are we doing oh just hanging out with our grammy what what
it think we can do better than this hello tedxusc
we are ok go have you read the natural curiosity cabinet
i mean curiosity excuse me
let me start again
we need some more ridiculous things besides the cabinet of natural curiosities
tims sundial hat
have you seen the new work theyve done to the waltz towers
sorry start again
dogs
hello tedxusc we are ok go and this our new video this too shall pass
kay we can still do one better i think yeah
that ones pretty good its getting better

title james hansen why i must speak out about climate change title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript top climate scientist james hansen tells the story of his involvement in the science of and debate over global climate change in doing so he outlines the overwhelming evidence that change is happening and why that makes him deeply worried about the future description
what do i know that would cause me a reticent midwestern scientist to get myself arrested in front of the white house protesting
and what would you do if you knew what i know
lets start with how i got to this point
i was lucky to grow up at a time when it was not difficult for the child of a tenant farmer to make his way to the state university
and i was really lucky to go to the university of iowa where i could study under professor james van allen who built instruments for the first u s satellites
professor van allen told me about observations of venus that there was intense microwave radiation
did it mean that venus had an ionosphere
or was venus extremely hot
the right answer confirmed by the soviet venera spacecraft was that venus was very hot degrees fahrenheit
and it was kept hot by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere
i was fortunate to join nasa and successfully propose an experiment to fly to venus
our instrument took this image of the veil of venus which turned out to be a smog of sulfuric acid
but while our instrument was being built i became involved in calculations of the greenhouse effect here on earth because we realized that our atmospheric composition was changing
eventually i resigned as principal investigator on our venus experiment because a planet changing before our eyes is more interesting and important
its changes will affect all of humanity
the greenhouse effect had been well understood for more than a century
british physicist john tyndall in the made laboratory measurements of the infrared radiation which is heat
and he showed that gasses such as absorb heat thus acting like a blanket warming earths surface
i worked with other scientists to analyze earth climate observations
in we published an article in science magazine concluding that observed warming of degrees celsius in the prior century was consistent with the greenhouse effect of increasing
that earth would likely warm in the and warming would exceed the noise level of random weather by the end of the century
we also said that the century would see shifting climate zones creation of drought prone regions in north america and asia erosion of ice sheets rising sea levels and opening of the fabled northwest passage
all of these impacts have since either happened or are now well under way
that paper was reported on the front page of the new york times and led to me testifying to congress in the testimony in which i emphasized that global warming increases both extremes of the earths water cycle
heatwaves and droughts on one hand directly from the warming but also because a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor with its latent energy rainfall will become in more extreme events
there will be stronger storms and greater flooding
global warming hoopla became time consuming and distracted me from doing science partly because i had complained that the white house altered my testimony
so i decided to go back to strictly doing science and leave the communication to others
by years later evidence of global warming was much stronger
most of the things mentioned in our paper were facts
i had the privilege to speak twice to the presidents climate task force
but energy policies continued to focus on finding more fossil fuels
by then we had two grandchildren sophie and connor
i decided that i did not want them in the future to say opa understood what was happening but he didnt make it clear
so i decided to give a public talk criticizing the lack of an appropriate energy policy
i gave the talk at the university of iowa in and at the meeting of the american geophysical union
this led to calls from the white house to nasa headquarters and i was told that i could not give any talks or speak with the media without prior explicit approval by nasa headquarters
after i informed the new york times about these restrictions nasa was forced to end the censorship
but there were consequences
i had been using the first line of the nasa mission statement to understand and protect the home planet to justify my talks
soon the first line of the mission statement was deleted never to appear again
over the next few years i was drawn more and more into trying to communicate the urgency of a change in energy policies while still researching the physics of climate change
let me describe the most important conclusion from the physics first from earths energy balance and second from earths climate history
adding to the air is like throwing another blanket on the bed
it reduces earths heat radiation to space so theres a temporary energy imbalance
more energy is coming in than going out until earth warms up enough to again radiate to space as much energy as it absorbs from the sun
so the key quantity is earths energy imbalance
is there more energy coming in than going out
if so more warming is in the pipeline
it will occur without adding any more greenhouse gasses
now finally we can measure earths energy imbalance precisely by measuring the heat content in earths heat reservoirs
the biggest reservoir the ocean was the least well measured until more than argo floats were distributed around the worlds ocean
these floats reveal that the upper half of the ocean is gaining heat at a substantial rate
the deep ocean is also gaining heat at a smaller rate and energy is going into the net melting of ice all around the planet
and the land to depths of tens of meters is also warming
the total energy imbalance now is about six tenths of a watt per square meter
that may not sound like much but when added up over the whole world its enormous
its about times greater than the rate of energy use by all of humanity
its equivalent to exploding hiroshima atomic bombs per day days per year
thats how much extra energy earth is gaining each day
this imbalance if we want to stabilize climate means that we must reduce from ppm parts per million back to ppm
that is the change needed to restore energy balance and prevent further warming
climate change deniers argue that the sun is the main cause of climate change
but the measured energy imbalance occurred during the deepest solar minimum in the record when the suns energy reaching earth was least
yet there was more energy coming in than going out
this shows that the effect of the suns variations on climate is overwhelmed by the increasing greenhouse gasses mainly from burning fossil fuels
now consider earths climate history
these curves for global temperature atmospheric and sea level were derived from ocean cores and antarctic ice cores from ocean sediments and snowflakes that piled up year after year over years forming a two mile thick ice sheet
as you see theres a high correlation between temperature and sea level
careful examination shows that the temperature changes slightly lead the changes by a few centuries
climate change deniers like to use this fact to confuse and trick the public by saying look the temperature causes to change not vice versa
but that lag is exactly what is expected
small changes in earths orbit that occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years alter the distribution of sunlight on earth
when there is more sunlight at high latitudes in summer ice sheets melt
shrinking ice sheets make the planet darker so it absorbs more sunlight and becomes warmer
a warmer ocean releases just as a warm coca cola does
and more causes more warming
so methane and ice sheets were feedbacks that amplified global temperature change causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak forcing
the important point is that these same amplifying feedbacks will occur today
the physics does not change
as earth warms now because of extra we put in the atmosphere ice will melt and and methane will be released by warming ocean and melting permafrost
while we cant say exactly how fast these amplifying feedbacks will occur it is certain they will occur unless we stop the warming
there is evidence that feedbacks are already beginning
precise measurements by grace the gravity satellite reveal that both greenland and antarctica are now losing mass several hundred cubic kilometers per year
and the rate has accelerated since the measurements began nine years ago
methane is also beginning to escape from the permafrost
what sea level rise can we look forward to
the last time was ppm todays value sea level was higher by at least meters feet
where you are sitting now would be under water
most estimates are that this century we will get at least one meter
i think it will be more if we keep burning fossil fuels perhaps even five meters which is feet this century or shortly thereafter
the important point is that we will have started a process that is out of humanitys control
ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries
there would be no stable shoreline
the economic consequences are almost unthinkable
hundreds of new orleans like devastations around the world
what may be more reprehensible if climate denial continues is extermination of species
the monarch butterfly could be one of the to percent of all species that the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates will be ticketed for extinction by the end of the century if we stay on business as usual fossil fuel use
global warming is already affecting people
the texas oklahoma mexico heatwave and drought last year moscow the year before and europe in were all exceptional events more than three standard deviations outside the norm
fifty years ago such anomalies covered only two to three tenths of one percent of the land area
in recent years because of global warming they now cover about percent an increase by a factor of to
so we can say with a high degree of confidence that the severe texas and moscow heatwaves were not natural they were caused by global warming
an important impact if global warming continues will be on the breadbasket of our nation and the world the midwest and great plains which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts worse than the dust bowl within just a few decades if we let global warming continue
how did i get dragged deeper and deeper into an attempt to communicate giving talks in countries getting arrested burning up the vacation time that i had accumulated over years
more grandchildren helped me along
jake is a super positive enthusiastic boy
here at age two and a half years he thinks he can protect his two and a half day old little sister
it would be immoral to leave these young people with a climate system spiraling out of control
now the tragedy about climate change is that we can solve it with a simple honest approach of a gradually rising carbon fee collected from fossil fuel companies and distributed percent electronically every month to all legal residents on a per capita basis with the government not keeping one dime
most people would get more in the monthly dividend than theyd pay in increased prices
this fee and dividend would stimulate the economy and innovations creating millions of jobs
it is the principal requirement for moving us rapidly to a clean energy future
several top economists are coauthors on this proposition
jim dipeso of republicans for environmental protection describes it thusly transparent market based
does not enlarge government
leaves energy decisions to individual choices
sounds like a conservative climate plan
but instead of placing a rising fee on carbon emissions to make fossil fuels pay their true cost to society our governments are forcing the public to subsidize fossil fuels by to billion dollars per year worldwide thus encouraging extraction of every fossil fuel mountaintop removal longwall mining fracking tar sands tar shale deep ocean arctic drilling
this path if continued guarantees that we will pass tipping points leading to ice sheet disintegration that will accelerate out of control of future generations
a large fraction of species will be committed to extinction
and increasing intensity of droughts and floods will severely impact breadbaskets of the world causing massive famines and economic decline
imagine a giant asteroid on a direct collision course with earth
that is the equivalent of what we face now
yet we dither taking no action to divert the asteroid even though the longer we wait the more difficult and expensive it becomes
if we had started in it would have required emission reductions of three percent per year to restore planetary energy balance and stabilize climate this century
if we start next year it is six percent per year
if we wait years it is percent per year extremely difficult and expensive perhaps impossible
but we arent even starting
so now you know what i know that is moving me to sound this alarm
clearly i havent gotten this message across
the science is clear
i need your help to communicate the gravity and the urgency of this situation and its solutions more effectively
we owe it to our children and grandchildren
thank you

title laura snyder the philosophical breakfast club title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript in four men at cambridge university met for breakfast what began as an impassioned meal grew into a new scientific revolution in which these men who called themselves natural philosophers until they later coined scientist introduced four major principles into scientific inquiry historian and philosopher laura snyder tells their intriguing story description
id like you to come back with me for a moment to the century specifically to june
the british association for the advancement of science is holding its third meeting at the university of cambridge
its the first night of the meeting and a confrontation is about to take place that will change science forever
an elderly white haired man stands up
the members of the association are shocked to realize that its the poet samuel taylor coleridge who hadnt even left his house in years until that day
theyre even more shocked by what he says
you must stop calling yourselves natural philosophers
coleridge felt that true philosophers like himself pondered the cosmos from their armchairs
they were not mucking around in the fossil pits or conducting messy experiments with electrical piles like the members of the british association
the crowd grew angry and began to complain loudly
a young cambridge scholar named william whewell stood up and quieted the audience
he politely agreed that an appropriate name for the members of the association did not exist
if philosophers is taken to be too wide and lofty a term he said then by analogy with artist we may form scientist this was the first time the word scientist was uttered in public only years ago
i first found out about this confrontation when i was in graduate school and it kind of blew me away
i mean how could the word scientist not have existed until
what were scientists called before
what had changed to make a new name necessary precisely at that moment
prior to this meeting those who studied the natural world were talented amateurs
think of the country clergyman or squire collecting his beetles or fossils like charles darwin for example or the hired help of a nobleman like joseph priestley who was the literary companion to the marquis of lansdowne when he discovered oxygen
after this they were scientists professionals with a particular scientific method goals societies and funding
much of this revolution can be traced to four men who met at cambridge university in charles babbage john herschel richard jones and william whewell
these were brilliant driven men who accomplished amazing things
charles babbage i think known to most tedsters invented the first mechanical calculator and the first prototype of a modern computer
john herschel mapped the stars of the southern hemisphere and in his spare time co invented photography
im sure we could all be that productive without facebook or twitter to take up our time
richard jones became an important economist who later influenced karl marx
and whewell not only coined the term scientist as well as the words anode cathode and ion but spearheaded international big science with his global research on the tides
in the cambridge winter of and the four met for what they called philosophical breakfasts
they talked about science and the need for a new scientific revolution
they felt science had stagnated since the days of the scientific revolution that had happened in the century
it was time for a new revolution which they pledged to bring about and whats so amazing about these guys is not only did they have these grandiose undergraduate dreams but they actually carried them out even beyond their wildest dreams
and im going to tell you today about four major changes to science these men made
about years before francis bacon and then later isaac newton had proposed an inductive scientific method
now thats a method that starts from observations and experiments and moves to generalizations about nature called natural laws which are always subject to revision or rejection should new evidence arise
however in david ricardo muddied the waters by arguing that the science of economics should use a different deductive method
the problem was that an influential group at oxford began arguing that because it worked so well in economics this deductive method ought to be applied to the natural sciences too
the members of the philosophical breakfast club disagreed
they wrote books and articles promoting inductive method in all the sciences that were widely read by natural philosophers university students and members of the public
reading one of herschels books was such a watershed moment for charles darwin that he would later say scarcely anything in my life made so deep an impression on me
it made me wish to add my might to the accumulated store of natural knowledge
it also shaped darwins scientific method as well as that used by his peers
previously it was believed that scientific knowledge ought to be used for the good of the king or queen or for ones own personal gain
for example ship captains needed to know information about the tides in order to safely dock at ports
harbormasters would gather this knowledge and sell it to the ship captains
the philosophical breakfast club changed that working together
whewells worldwide study of the tides resulted in public tide tables and tidal maps that freely provided the harbormasters knowledge to all ship captains
herschel helped by making tidal observations off the coast of south africa and as he complained to whewell he was knocked off the docks during a violent high tide for his trouble
the four men really helped each other in every way
they also relentlessly lobbied the british government for the money to build babbages engines because they believed these engines would have a huge practical impact on society
in the days before pocket calculators the numbers that most professionals needed bankers insurance agents ship captains engineers were to be found in lookup books like this filled with tables of figures
these tables were calculated using a fixed procedure over and over by part time workers known as and this is amazing computers but these calculations were really difficult
i mean this nautical almanac published the lunar differences for every month of the year
each month required calculations so these tables were filled with mistakes
babbages difference engine was the first mechanical calculator devised to accurately compute any of these tables
two models of his engine were built in the last years by a team from the science museum of london using his own plans
this is the one now at the computer history museum in california and it calculates accurately it actually works
later babbages analytical engine was the first mechanical computer in the modern sense
it had a separate memory and central processor
it was capable of iteration conditional branching and parallel processing and it was programmable using punched cards an idea babbage took from jacquards loom
tragically babbages engines never were built in his day because most people thought that non human computers would have no usefulness for the public
founded in bacons time the royal society of london was the foremost scientific society in england and even in the rest of the world
by the century it had become a kind of gentlemans club populated mainly by antiquarians literary men and the nobility
the members of the philosophical breakfast club helped form a number of new scientific societies including the british association
these new societies required that members be active researchers publishing their results
they reinstated the tradition of the q amp a after scientific papers were read which had been discontinued by the royal society as being ungentlemanly
and for the first time they gave women a foot in the door of science
members were encouraged to bring their wives daughters and sisters to the meetings of the british association and while the women were expected to attend only the public lectures and the social events like this one they began to infiltrate the scientific sessions as well
the british association would later be the first of the major national science organizations in the world to admit women as full members
up to the century natural philosophers were expected to pay for their own equipment and supplies
occasionally there were prizes such as that given to john harrison in the century for solving the so called longitude problem but prizes were only given after the fact when they were given at all
on the advice of the philosophical breakfast club the british association began to use the extra money generated by its meetings to give grants for research in astronomy the tides fossil fish shipbuilding and many other areas
these grants not only allowed less wealthy men to conduct research but they also encouraged thinking outside the box rather than just trying to solve one pre set question
eventually the royal society and the scientific societies of other countries followed suit and this has become fortunately its become a major part of the scientific landscape today
so the philosophical breakfast club helped invent the modern scientist
thats the heroic part of their story
theres a flip side as well
they did not foresee at least one consequence of their revolution
they would have been deeply dismayed by todays disjunction between science and the rest of culture
its shocking to realize that only percent of american adults have even a very basic level of science literacy and this was tested by asking simple questions like did humans and dinosaurs inhabit the earth at the same time
and what proportion of the earth is covered in water
once scientists became members of a professional group they were slowly walled off from the rest of us
this is the unintended consequence of the revolution that started with our four friends
charles darwin said i sometimes think that general and popular treatises are almost as important for the progress of science as original work
in fact origin of species was written for a general and popular audience and was widely read when it first appeared
darwin knew what we seem to have forgotten that science is not only for scientists
thank you

title zach kaplan keith schacht toys and materials from the future title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript the inventables guys zach kaplan and keith schacht demo some amazing new materials and how we might use them look for squishy magnets odor detecting ink dry liquid and a very surprising foot pole description
zach kaplan keith and i lead a research team
we investigate materials and technologies that have unexpected properties over the last three years we found over of these things and so we looked back into our library and selected six we thought would be most surprising for ted
of these six the first one that were going to talk about is in the black envelope youre holding
it comes from a company in japan called geltech now go ahead and open it up
keith schacht now be sure and take the two pieces apart
whats unexpected about this is that its soft but its also a strong magnet
zach and i have always been fascinated observing unexpected things like this
we spent a long time thinking about why this is and its just recently that we realized its when we see something unexpected it changes our understanding of the way things work
as youre seeing this gel magnet for the first time if you assume that all magnets had to be hard then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding of the way magnets could work
zk now its important to understand what the unexpected properties are
but to really think about the implications of what this makes possible we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world
so a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors
if you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material if a cabinet slams shut it wouldnt make a loud noise and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed
imagine taking the same material but putting it on the bottom of a sneaker
you know this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door in your closet and you could literally stick your shoes up instead of using a shelf
for me i really love this idea
if you come to my apartment and see my closet im sure youd figure out why its a mess
ks seeing the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple of applications it helps you see why this is significant what the potential is
but weve found that the way we present our ideas it makes a big difference
zk it was like six months ago that keith and i were out in l a and we were at starbucks having coffee with roman coppola
he works on mostly music videos and commercials with his company the directors bureau
as we were talking roman told us that hes kind of an inventor on the side
and we were showing him the same gel magnet that youre holding in your hand and you know we shared the same ideas and you could see it in his face roman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder he opens it up and keith and i look in and he starts showing us concepts that hes been working on
these things just get him really excited and so were looking at these concepts and we were just like whoa this guys good
because the way that he presented the concept his approach was totally different than ours he sold it to you as if it was for sale right now
when we were going in the car back to the airport we were thinking why was this so powerful
and as we thought about it more we realized that it let you fill in all the details about the experience just as if you saw it on tv so for ted we decided to take our favorite idea for the gel magnet and work with roman and his team at the directors bureau to create a commercial for a product from the future
narrator do you have a need for speed
inventables water adventures dares you to launch yourself on a magnetically levitating board down a waterslide so fast so tall that when you hit the bottom it uses brakes to stop
aqua rocket coming this summer
ks now we showed the concept to a few people before this and they asked us whens it coming out
so i just wanted to let you know its not actually coming out just the concept is
zk so now when we dream up these concepts its important for us to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint
so i just want to quickly explain how this would work
this is the magnetically levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial
the gel that youre holding would be lining the bottom of the board
now this is important for two reasons
one the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that if it were to hit the rider in the head it wouldnt injure him
in addition you can see from the diagram on the right the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet
so this would actually repel the rider a little bit as youre going down
the force of the water rushing down in addition to that repulsion force would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market
its because of this that you need the magnetic braking system
when you get to the very bottom of the slide the rider passes through an aluminum tube
and im going to kick it to keith to explain why thats important from a technical standpoint
ks so im sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is a metal its not a magnetic material but something unexpected happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube
so we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you
now you see the magnet fell really slowly
now im not going to get into the physics of it but all you need to know is that the faster the magnets falling the greater the stopping force
zk now our next technology is actually a foot pole and i have it right here in my pocket
therere a few different versions of it
ks some of them automatically unroll like this one
they can be made to automatically roll up or they can be made stable like zachs to hold any position in between
zk as we were talking to the vendor to try to learn about how you could apply these or how theyre being applied currently he was telling us that in the military they use this one so soldiers can keep it on their chests very concealed and then when theyre out on the field erect it as an antenna to clearly send signals back to the base
in our brainstorms we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal so at the end of the game you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag
ks now the interesting thing about this is you dont have to be an engineer to appreciate why a foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting
so we decided to go out onto the streets of chicago and ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this
man i clean my ceiling fans with that and i get the spider webs off my house i do it that way
woman id make my very own walking stick
woman i would create a ladder to use to get up on top of the tree
woman an olive server
man some type of extension pole like what the painters use
woman i would make a spear that when you went deep sea diving you could catch the fish really fast and then roll it back up and you could swim easier yeah
zk now for our next technology were going to do a little demonstration and so we need a volunteer from the audience
you sir come on up
come on up tell everybody your name
steve jurvetson steve
zk its steve all right steve now follow me
we need you to stand right in front of the ted sign
right there thats great
and hold onto this good luck to you
ks no not yet
zk id just like to let you all know that this presentation has been brought to you by target
ks little bit thats perfect just perfect
now zach were going to demonstrate a water gun fight from the future
so here come on up to the front all right so now if youll see here no no its ok
so describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt go ahead
sj its cold
ks now the reason its cold is thats its not actually water loaded into these squirt guns its a dry liquid developed by
its perfectly clear its odorless its colorless
its so safe you could drink this stuff
and the reason it feels cold is because it evaporates times faster than water
all right well thanks for coming up
zk wait wait steven before you go we filled this with the dry liquid so during the break you can shoot your friends
sj excellent thank you
ks thanks for coming up lets give him a big round of applause
so whats the significance of this dry liquid
early versions of the fluid were actually used on a cray supercomputer
now the unexpected thing about this is that zach could stand up on stage and drench a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern that wed damage the electronics that wed get him wet that wed hurt the books or the computers it works because its non conductive
so you can see here you can immerse a whole circuit board in this and it wouldnt cause any damage
you can circulate it to draw the heat away
but today its most widely used in office buildings in the sprinkler system as a fire suppression fluid
again its perfectly safe for people it puts out the fires doesnt hurt anything
but our favorite idea for this was using it in a basketball game so during halftime it could rain down on the players cool everyone down and in a matter of minutes it would dry wouldnt hurt the court
zk our next technology comes to us from a company in japan called sekisui chemical one of their r amp d engineers was working on a way to make plastic stiffer
while he was doing this he noticed an unexpected thing
we have a video to show you
ks so you see there it didnt bounce back now this was an unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing
its technically called shape retaining property
now think about your interactions with aluminum foil
shape retaining is common in metal you bend a piece of aluminum foil and it holds its place contrast that with a plastic garbage can and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back
zk for example you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist but doesnt use a buckle
taking it a little further if you wove those strips together kind of like a little basket you could make a shape retaining sheet and then you could embed it in a cloth so you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table so that way on a windy day it wouldnt blow away
for our next technology its hard to observe the unexpected property by itself because its an ink
so weve prepared a video to show it applied to paper
ks as this paper is bending the resistance of the ink changes
so with simple electronics you can detect how much the page is being bent
now to think about the potential for this think of all the places ink is supplied on business cards on the back of cereal boxes board games any place you use ink you could change the way you interact with it
zk so my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book
this could totally change the way that you interface with paper
you see the dark line on the side and the top as you turn the pages of the book the book can actually detect what page youre on based on the curvature of the pages
in addition if you were to fold in one of the corners then you could program the book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes
ks for our last technology we worked again with roman and his team at the directors bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works
old milk carton oh yeah it smells good
who are you
new milk carton im new milk
omc i used to smell like you
narrator fresh watch from inventables dairy farms
packaging that changes color when your milks gone off
dont let milk spoil your morning
zk now this technology was developed by these two guys professor ken suslick and neil rakow of the university of illinois
ks now the way it works theres a matrix of color dyes
and these dyes change color in response to odors
so the smell of vanilla that might change the four on the left to brown and the one on the right to yellow this matrix can produce thousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells
but like in the milk commercial if you know what odor you want to detect then they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor
zk right it was that that started a conversation with professor suslick and myself and he was explaining to me the things that this is making possible beyond just detecting spoiled food its really where the significance of it lies
his company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene
and he kind of comically explained that time after time what the firemen would say is they would rush to the scene of the crime they would look around if there were no dead policemen it was ok to go
i mean this is a true story theyre using policemen as canaries
but more seriously they determined that you could develop a device that can smell better than the humans and say if its safe for the firemen
in addition hes spun off a company from the university called chemsensing where theyre working on medical equipment
so a patient can come in and actually blow into their device
by detecting the odor of particular bacteria or viruses or even lung cancer the dots will change and they can use software to analyze the results
this can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients
currently theyre using a method of trial and error but this could tell you precisely what disease you have
ks so that was the six we had for you today but i hope youre starting to see why we find these things so fascinating
because every one of these six changed our understanding of what was possible in the world prior to seeing this we would have assumed a foot pole couldnt fit in your pocket something as inexpensive as ink couldnt sense the way paper is being bent every one of these things and were constantly trying to find more
zk this is something that keith and i really enjoy doing
im sure its obvious to you now but it was actually yesterday that i was reminded of why i was having a conversation with steve jurvetson over downstairs by the escalators and he was telling me that when chris sent out that little box one of the items in it was the hydrophobic sand the sand that doesnt get wet he said that he was playing with it with his son
and you know his son was mesmerized because he would dunk it in the water he would take it out and it was bone dry a few weeks later he said that his son was playing with a lock of his mothers hair and he noticed that there were some drops of water on the hair
and he took the thing and he looked up to steve and he said look hydrophobic string
i mean after hearing that story that really summed it up for me
thank you very much
ks thank you

title rose george lets talk crap seriously title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript its yet billion people in the world have no access to a basic sanitary toilet and when theres no loo where do you poo in the street probably near your water and food sources causing untold death and disease from contamination get ready for a blunt funny powerful talk from journalist rose george about a once unmentionable problem description
lets talk dirty
a few years ago oddly enough i needed the bathroom and i found one a public bathroom and i went into the stall and i prepared to do what id done most of my life use the toilet flush the toilet forget about the toilet
and for some reason that day instead i asked myself a question and it was where does this stuff go
and with that question i found myself plunged into the world of sanitation theres more coming sanitation toilets and poop and i have yet to emerge
and thats because its such an enraging yet engaging place to be
to go back to that toilet it wasnt a particularly fancy toilet it wasnt as nice as this one from the world toilet organization
thats the other wto
but it had a lockable door it had privacy it had water it had soap so i could wash my hands and i did because im a woman and we do that
but that day when i asked that question i learned something and that was that id grown up thinking that a toilet like that was my right when in fact its a privilege
billion people worldwide have no adequate toilet
they dont have a bucket or a box
forty percent of the world with no adequate toilet
and they have to do what this little boy is doing by the side of the mumbai airport expressway which is called open defecation or poo pooing in the open
and he does that every day and every day probably that guy in the picture walks on by because he sees that little boy but he doesnt see him
but he should because the problem with all that poop lying around is that poop carries passengers
fifty communicable diseases like to travel in human shit
all those things the eggs the cysts the bacteria the viruses all those can travel in one gram of human feces
how well that little boy will not have washed his hands
hes barefoot hell run back into his house and he will contaminate his drinking water and his food and his environment with whatever diseases he may be carrying by fecal particles that are on his fingers and feet
in what i call the flushed and plumbed world that most of us in this room are lucky to live in the most common symptoms associated with those diseases diarrhea is now a bit of a joke
its the runs the hershey squirts the squits
where i come from we call it delhi belly as a legacy of empire
but if you search for a stock photo of diarrhea in a leading photo image agency this is the picture that you come up with
still not sure about the bikini
and heres another image of diarrhea
this is marie saylee nine months old
you cant see her because shes buried under that green grass in a little village in liberia because she died in three days from diarrhea the hershey squirts the runs a joke
and thats her dad
but she wasnt alone that day because other children died of diarrhea and they do every day
diarrhea is the second biggest killer of children worldwide and youve probably been asked to care about things like hiv aids or t b or measles but diarrhea kills more children than all those three things put together
its a very potent weapon of mass destruction
and the cost to the world is immense billion dollars lost every year on the losses to poor sanitation
these are cholera beds in haiti
youll have heard of cholera but we dont hear about diarrhea
it gets a fraction of the attention and funding given to any of those other diseases
but we know how to fix this
we know because in the mid century wonderful victorian engineers installed systems of sewers and wastewater treatment and the flush toilet and disease dropped dramatically
child mortality dropped by the most it had ever dropped in history
the flush toilet was voted the best medical advance of the last years by the readers of the british medical journal and they were choosing over the pill anesthesia and surgery
its a wonderful waste disposal device
but i think that its so good it doesnt smell we can put it in our house we can lock it behind a door and i think weve locked it out of conversation too
we dont have a neutral word for it
poops not particularly adequate
shit offends people feces is too medical
because i cant explain otherwise when i look at the figures whats going on
we know how to solve diarrhea and sanitation but if you look at the budgets of countries developing and developed youll think theres something wrong with the math because youll expect absurdities like pakistan spending times more on its military than it does on water and sanitation even though children die of diarrhea in pakistan every year
but then you look at that already minuscule water and sanitation budget and to percent of it will go on clean water supply which is great we all need water
no ones going to refuse clean water
but the humble latrine or flush toilet reduces disease by twice as much as just putting in clean water
think about it that little boy whos running back into his house he may have a nice clean fresh water supply but hes got dirty hands that hes going to contaminate his water supply with
and i think that the real waste of human waste is that we are wasting it as a resource and as an incredible trigger for development because these are a few things that toilets and poop itself can do for us
so a toilet can put a girl back in school
twenty five percent of girls in india drop out of school because they have no adequate sanitation
theyve been used to sitting through lessons for years and years holding it in
weve all done that but they do it every day and when they hit puberty and they start menstruating it just gets too much
and i understand that who can blame them
so if you met an educationalist and said i can improve education attendance rates by percent with just one simple thing youd make a lot of friends in education
thats not the only thing it can do for you
poop can cook your dinner
its got nutrients in it
we ingest nutrients we excrete nutrients as well
we dont keep them all
in rwanda they are now getting percent of their cooking fuel in their prison system from the contents of prisoners bowels
so these are a bunch of inmates in a prison in butare
theyre genocidal inmates most of them and theyre stirring the contents of their own latrines because if you put poop in a sealed environment in a tank pretty much like a stomach then pretty much like a stomach it gives off gas and you can cook with it
and you might think its just good karma to see these guys stirring shit but its also good economic sense because theyre saving a million dollars a year
theyre cutting down on deforestation and theyve found a fuel supply that is inexhaustible infinite and free at the point of production
its not just in the poor world that poop can save lives
heres a woman whos about to get a dose of the brown stuff in those syringes which is what you think it is except not quite because its actually donated
there is now a new career path called stool donor
its like the new sperm donor
because she has been suffering from a superbug called c diff and its resistant to antibiotics in many cases
shes been suffering for years
she gets a dose of healthy human feces and the cure rate for this procedure is percent
its astonishing but hardly anyone is still doing it
maybe its the ick factor
thats okay because theres a team of research scientists in canada who have now created a stool sample a fake stool sample which is called repoopulate
so youd be thinking by now okay the solutions simple we give everyone a toilet
and this is where it gets really interesting because its not that simple because we are not simple
so the really interesting exciting work this is the engaging bit in sanitation is that we need to understand human psychology
we need to understand software as well as just giving someone hardware
theyve found in many developing countries that governments have gone in and given out free latrines and gone back a few years later and found that theyve got lots of new goat sheds or temples or spare rooms with their owners happily walking past them and going over to the open defecating ground
so the idea is to manipulate human emotion
its been done for decades the soap companies did it in the early century
they tried selling soap as healthy no one bought it
they tried selling it as sexy everyone bought it
in india now theres a campaign which persuades young brides not to marry into families that dont have a toilet
its called no loo no i do
and in case you think that posters just propaganda heres priyanka years old
i met her last october in india and she grew up in a conservative environment
she grew up in a rural village in a poor area of india and she was engaged at and then at or so she moved into her in laws house
and she was horrified to get there and find that they didnt have a toilet
shed grown up with a latrine
it was no big deal but it was a latrine
and the first night she was there she was told that at oclock in the morning her mother in law got her up told her to go outside and go and do it in the dark in the open
and she was scared she was scared of drunks hanging around
she was scared of snakes she was scared of rape
after three days she did an unthinkable thing
she left
and if you know anything about rural india youll know thats an unspeakably courageous thing to do
but not just that
she got her toilet and now she goes around all the other villages in india persuading other women to do the same thing
its what i call social contagion and its really powerful and really exciting
another version of this another village in india near where priyanka lives is this village called lakara and about a year ago it had no toilets whatsoever
kids were dying of diarrhea and cholera
some visitors came using various behavioral change tricks like putting out a plate of food and a plate of shit and watching the flies go one to the other
somehow people whod been thinking that what they were doing was not disgusting at all suddenly thought oops
not only that but they were ingesting their neighbors shit
thats what really made them change their behavior
so this woman this boys mother installed this latrine in a few hours
her entire life shed been using the banana field behind but she installed the latrine in a few hours
it cost nothing its going to save that boys life
so when i get despondent about the state of sanitation even though these are pretty exciting times because weve got the bill and melinda gates foundation reinventing the toilet which is great weve got matt damon going on bathroom strike which is great for humanity very bad for his colon
but there are things to worry about
its the most off track millennium development goal
its about or so years off track
were not going to meet targets providing people with sanitation at this rate
so when i get sad about sanitation i think of japan because japan years ago was a nation of people who used pit latrines and wiped with sticks and now its a nation of what are called woshurettos washlet toilets
they have in built bidet nozzles for a lovely hands free cleaning experience and they have various other features like a heated seat and an automatic lid raising device which is known as the marriage saver
but most importantly what they have done in japan which i find so inspirational is theyve brought the toilet out from behind the locked door
theyve made it conversational
people go out and upgrade their toilet
they talk about it theyve sanitized it
i hope that we can do that its not a difficult thing to do
all we really need to do is look at this issue as the urgent shameful issue that it is
and dont think that its just in the poor world that things are wrong
our sewers are crumbling
things are going wrong here too
the solution to all of this is pretty easy
im going to make your lives easy this afternoon and just ask you to do one thing and thats to go out protest speak about the unspeakable and talk shit
thank you

title frank gehry my days as a young rebel title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript before he was a legend architect frank gehry takes a whistlestop tour of his early work from his house in venice beach to the american center in paris which was under construction when he gave this talk description
im going to go right into the slides
and all im going to try and prove to you with these slides is that i do just very straight stuff
and my ideas are in my head anyway theyre very logical and relate to whats going on and problem solving for clients
i either convince clients at the end that i solve their problems or i really do solve their problems because usually they seem to like it
let me go right into the slides
can you turn off the light down
i like to be in the dark
i dont want you to see what im doing up here
anyway i did this house in santa monica and it got a lot of notoriety
in fact it appeared in a porno comic book which is the slide on the right
this is in venice
i just show it because i want you to know im concerned about context
on the left hand side i had the context of those little houses and i tried to build a building that fit into that context
when people take pictures of these buildings out of that context they look really weird and my premise is that they make a lot more sense when theyre photographed or seen in that space
and then once i deal with the context i then try to make a place thats comfortable and private and fairly serene as i hope youll find that slide on the right
and then i did a law school for loyola in downtown l a
i was concerned about making a place for the study of law
and we continue to work with this client
the building on the right at the top is now under construction
the garage on the right the gray structure will be torn down finally and several small classrooms will be placed along this avenue that weve created this campus
and it all related to the clients and the students from the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place
they wanted a sense of place
and so the whole idea here was to create that kind of space in downtown in a neighborhood that was difficult to fit into
and it was my theory or my point of view that one didnt upstage the neighborhood one made accommodations
i tried to be inclusive to include the buildings in the neighborhood whether they were buildings i liked or not
in the i started working with paper furniture and made a bunch of stuff that was very successful in bloomingdales
we even made flooring walls and everything out of cardboard
and the success of it threw me for a loop
i couldnt deal with the success of furniture i wasnt secure enough as an architect and so i closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like
so nobody would like this
and it was in this preliminary to these pieces of furniture that ricky and i worked on furniture by the slice
and after we failed i just kept failing
the piece on the left and that ultimately led to the piece on the right happened when the kid that was working on this took one of those long strings of stuff and folded it up to put it in the wastebasket
and i put a piece of tape around it as you see there and realized you could sit on it and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on
so it was an accidental discovery
i got into fish
i mean the story i tell is that i got mad at postmodernism at po mo and said that fish were million years earlier than man and if youre going to go back we might as well go back to the beginning
and so i started making these funny things
and they started to have a life of their own and got bigger as the one glass at the walker
and then i sliced off the head and the tail and everything and tried to translate what i was learning about the form of the fish and the movement
and a lot of my architectural ideas that came from it accidental again it was an intuitive kind of thing and i just kept going with it and made this proposal for a building which was only a proposal
i did this building in japan
i was taken out to dinner after the contract for this little restaurant was signed
and i love sake and kobe and all that stuff
and after i got i was really drunk i was asked to do some sketches on napkins
and i made some sketches on napkins little boxes and morandi like things that i used to do
and the client said why no fish
and so i made a drawing with a fish and i left japan
three weeks later i received a complete set of drawings saying wed won the competition
now its hard to do its hard to translate a fish form because theyre so beautiful perfect into a building or object like this
and oldenburg who i work with a little once in a while told me i couldnt do it and so that made it even more exciting
but he was right i couldnt do the tail
i started to get the head ok but the tail i couldnt do
it was pretty hard
the thing on the right is a snake form a ziggurat
and i put them together and you walk between them
it was a dialog with the context again
now if you saw a picture of this as it was published in architectural record they didnt show the context so you would think god what a pushy guy this is
but a friend of mine spent four hours wandering around here looking for this restaurant
couldnt find it
so
as for craft and technology and all those things that youve all been talking about i was thrown for a complete loop
this was built in six months
the way we sent drawings to japan we used the magic computer in michigan that does carved models and we used to make foam models which that thing scanned
we made the drawings of the fish and the scales
and when i got there everything was perfect except the tail
so i decided to cut off the head and the tail
and i made the object on the left for my show at the walker
and its one of the nicest pieces ive ever made i think
and then jay chiat a friend and client asked me to do his headquarters building in l a
for reasons we dont want to talk about it got delayed
toxic waste i guess is the key clue to that one
and so we built a temporary building im getting good at temporary and we put a conference room in thats a fish
and finally jay dragged me to my hometown toronto canada
and there is a story its a real story about my grandmother buying a carp on thursday bringing it home putting it in the bathtub when i was a kid
i played with it in the evening
when i went to sleep the next day it wasnt there
and the next night we had gefilte fish
and so i set up this interior for jays offices and i made a pedestal for a sculpture
and he didnt buy a sculpture so i made one
i went around toronto and found a bathtub like my grandmothers and i put the fish in
it was a joke
i play with funny people like oldenburg
weve been friends for a long time
and weve started to work on things
a few years ago we did a performance piece in venice italy called il corso del coltello the swiss army knife
and most of the imagery is claes but those two little boys are my sons and they were claes assistants in the play
he was the swiss army knife
he was a souvenir salesman who always wanted to be a painter and i was frankie p toronto
p for palladio
dressed up like the at amp t building by claes with a fish hat
the highlight of the performance was at the end
this beautiful object the swiss army knife which i get credit for participating in
and i can tell you its totally an oldenburg
i had nothing to do with it
the only thing i did was i made it possible for them to turn those blades so you could sail this thing in the canal because i love sailing
we made it into a sailing craft
ive been known to mess with things like chain link fencing
i do it because its a curious thing in the culture when things are made in such great quantities absorbed in such great quantities and theres so much denial about them
people hate it
and im fascinated with that which like the paper furniture its one of those materials
and im always drawn to that
and so i did a lot of dirty things with chain link which nobody will forgive me for
but claes made homage to it in the loyola law school
and that chain link is really expensive
its in perspective and everything
and then we did a camp together for children with cancer
and you can see we started making a building together
of course the milk can is his
but we were trying to collide our ideas to put objects next to each other
like a morandi like the little bottles composing them like a still life
and it seemed to work as a way to put he and i together
then jay chiat asked me to do this building on this funny lot in venice and i started with this three piece thing and you entered in the middle
and jay asked me what i was going to do with the piece in the middle
and he pushed that
and one day i had a oh well the other way
i had the binoculars from claes and i put them there and i could never get rid of them after that
oldenburg made the binoculars incredible when he sent me the first model of the real proposal
it made my building look sick
and it was this interaction between that kind of up the ante stuff that became pretty interesting
it led to the building on the left
and i still think the time magazine picture will be of the binoculars you know leaving out the what the hell
i use a lot of metal in my work and i have a hard time connecting with the craft
the whole thing about my house the whole use of rough carpentry and everything was the frustration with the crafts available
i said if i cant get the craft that i want ill use the craft i can get
there were plenty of models for that in rauschenberg and jasper johns and many artists who were making beautiful art and sculpture with junk materials
i went into the metal because it was a way of building a building that was a sculpture
and it was all of one material and the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls
the metalworkers for the most part do ducts behind the ceilings and stuff
i was given an opportunity to design an exhibit for the metalworkers unions of america and canada in washington and i did it on the condition that they become my partners in the future and help me with all future metal buildings etc etc
and its working very well to have these people these craftsmen interested in it
i just tell the stories
its a way of connecting at least with some of those people that are so important to the realization of architecture
the metal continued into a building herman miller in sacramento
and its just a complex of factory buildings
and herman miller has this philosophy of having a place a people place
i mean its kind of a trite thing to say but it is real that they wanted to have a central place where the cafeteria would be where the people would come and where the people working would interact
so its out in the middle of nowhere and you approach it
its copper and galvanize
i used the galvanize and copper in a very light gauge so it would buckle
i spent a lot of time undoing richard meiers aesthetic
everybodys trying to get the panels perfect and i always try to get them sloppy and fuzzy
and they end up looking like stone
this is the central area
theres a ramp
and that little dome in there is a building by stanley tigerman
stanley was instrumental in my getting this job
and when i was awarded the contract i at the very beginning asked the client if they would let stanley do a cameo piece with me
because these were ideas that we were talking about building things next to each other making its all about metaphor for a city maybe
and so stanley did the little dome thing
and we did it over the phone and by fax
he would send me a fax and show me something
hed made a building with a dome and he had a little tower
i told him no no thats too ongepotchket
i dont want the tower
so he came back with a simpler building but he put some funny details on it and he moved it closer to my building
and so i decided to put him in a depression
i put him in a hole and made a kind of a hole that he sits in
and so then he put two bridges this all happened on the fax going back and forth over a couple of weeks period
and he put these two bridges with pink guardrails on it
and so then i put this big billboard behind it
and i call it david and goliath
and thats my cafeteria
in boston we had that old building on the left
it was a very prominent building off the freeway and we added a floor and cleaned it up and fixed it up and used the kind of i thought the language of the neighborhood which had these cornices projecting cornices
mine got a little exuberant but i used lead copper which is a beautiful material and it turns green in years
instead of like copper in or
we redid the side of the building and re proportioned the windows so it sort of fit into the space
and it surprised both boston and myself that we got it approved because they have very strict kind of design guideline and they wouldnt normally think i would fit them
the detailing was very careful with the lead copper and making panels and fitting it tightly into the fabric of the existing building
in barcelona on las ramblas for some film festival i did the hollywood sign going and coming made a building out of it and they built it
i flew in one night and took this picture
but they made it a third smaller than my model without telling me
and then more metal and some chain link in santa monica a little shopping center
and this is a laser laboratory at the university of iowa in which the fish comes back as an abstraction in the back
its the support labs which by some coincidence required no windows
and the shape fit perfectly
i just joined the points
in the curved part theres all the mechanical equipment
that solid wall behind it is a pipe chase a pipe canyon and so it was an opportunity that i seized because i didnt have to have any protruding ducts or vents or things in this form
it gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it
this is a small house somewhere
theyve been building it so long i dont remember where it is
its in the west valley
and we started with the stream and built the house along the stream dammed it up to make a lake
these are the models
the reality with the lake the workmanship is pretty bad
and it reminded me why i play defensively in things like my house
when you have to do something really cheaply its hard to get perfect corners and stuff
that big metal thing is a passage and in it is you go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom which is on the right
its kind of like a whole built town
i was asked to do a hospital for schizophrenic adolescents at yale
i thought it was fitting for me to be doing that
this is a house next to a philip johnson house in minnesota
the owners had a dilemma they asked philip to do it
he was too busy
he didnt recommend me by the way
we ended up having to make it a sculpture because the dilemma was how do you build a building that doesnt look like the language
is it going to look like this beautiful estate is sub divided
etc etc
youve got the idea
and so we finally ended up making it
these people are art collectors
and we finally made it so it appears very sculptural from the main house and all the windows are on the other side
and the building is very sculptural as you walk around it
its made of metal and the brown stuff is fin ply its that formed lumber from finland
we used it at loyola on the chapel and it didnt work
i keep trying to make it work
in this case we learned how to detail it
in cleveland theres burnham mall on the left
its never been finished
going out to the lake you can see all those new buildings we built
and we had the opportunity to build a building on this site
theres a railroad track
this is the city hall over here somewhere and the courthouse
and the centerline of the mall goes out
burnham had designed a railroad station that was never built and so we followed
sohio is on the axis here and we followed the axis and theyre two kind of goalposts
and this is our building which is a corporate headquarters for an insurance company
we collaborated with oldenburg and put the newspaper on top folded
the health club is fastened to the garage with a c clamp for cleveland
you drive down
so its about a story c clamp
and all this stuff at the bottom is a museum and an idea for a very fancy automobile entry
this owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries
and this would be a hotel
so the centerline of this thing wed preserve it and it would start to work with the scale of the new buildings by pelli and kohn pederson fox etc that are underway
its hard to do high rise
i feel much more comfortable down here
this is a piece of property in brentwood
and a long time ago about or something after my house i designed a house for myself that would be a village of several pavilions around a courtyard and the owner of this lot worked for me and built that actual model on the left
and she came back i guess wealthier or something something happened and asked me to design a house for her on this site
and following that basic idea of the village we changed it as we got into it
i locked the house into the site by cutting the back end here you see on the photographs of the site slicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms like a retaining wall creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom which i designed like a kind of a barge looking like a boat
and thats it built
the dome was a request from the client
she wanted a dome somewhere in the house
she didnt care where
when you sleep in this bedroom i hope i mean i havent slept in it yet
ive offered to marry her so i could sleep there but she said i didnt have to do that
but when youre in that room you feel like youre on a kind of barge on some kind of lake
and its very private
the landscape is being built around to create a private garden
and then up above theres a garden on this side of the living room and one on the other side
these arent focused very well
i dont know how to do it from here
focus the one on the right
its up there
left its my right
anyway you enter into a garden with a beautiful grove of trees
thats the living room
servants quarters
a guest bedroom which has this dome with marble on it
and then you enter into the living room and then so on
this is the bedroom
you come down from this level along the stairway and you enter the bedroom here going into the lake
and the bed is back in this space with windows looking out onto the lake
these stonehenge things were designed to give foreground and to create a greater depth in this shallow lot
the material is lead copper like in the building in boston
and so it was an intent to make this small piece of land its by into a kind of an estate by separating these areas and making the living room and dining room into this pavilion with a high space in it
and this happened by accident that i got this right on axis with the dining room table
it looks like i got a baldessari painting for free
but the idea is the windows are all placed so you see pieces of the house outside
eventually this will be screened these trees will come up and it will be very private
and you feel like youre in your own kind of village
this is for michael eisner disney
were doing some work for him
and this is in anaheim california and its a freeway building
you go under this bridge at about miles an hour and theres another bridge here
and youre through this room in a split second and the building will sort of reflect that
on the backside its much more humane entrance dining hall etc
and then this thing here im hoping as you drive by youll hear the picket fence effect of the sound hitting it
kind of a fun thing to do
im doing a building in switzerland basel which is an office building for a furniture company
and we struggled with the image
these are the early studies but they have to sell furniture to normal people so if i did the building and it was too fancy then people might say well the furniture looks ok in his thing but no it aint going to look good in my normal building
so weve made a kind of pragmatic slab in the second phase here and weve taken the conference facilities and made a villa out of them so that the communal space is very sculptural and separate
and youre looking at it from the offices and you create a kind of interaction between these pieces
this is in paris along the seine
palais des sports the gare de lyon over here
the minister of finance the guy that moved from the louvre goes in here
theres a new library across the river
and back in here in this already treed park were doing a very dense building called the american center which has a theater apartments dance school an art museum restaurants and all kinds of its a very dense program bookstores etc
in a very tight small this is the ground level
and the french have this extraordinary way of screwing things up by taking a beautiful site and cutting the corner off
they call it the plan coupe
and i struggled with that thing how to get around the corner
these are the models for it
i showed you the other model the one this is the way i organized myself so i could make the drawing so i understood the problem
i was trying to get around this plan coupe how do you do it
apartments etc
and these are the kind of study models we did
and the one on the left is pretty awful
you can see why i was ready to commit suicide when this one was built
but out of it came finally this resolution where the elevator piece worked frontally to this parallel to this street and also parallel to here
and then this kind of twist with this balcony and the skirt kind of like a ballerina lifting her skirt to let you into the foyer
the restaurants here the apartments and the theater etc
so it would all be built in stone in french limestone except for this metal piece
and it faces into a park
and the idea was to make this express the energy of this
on the side facing the street its much more normal except i slipped a few mansards down so that coming on the point these housing units made a gesture to the corner
and this will be some kind of high tech billboard
if any of you guys have any ideas for it please contact me
i dont know what to do
jay chiat is a glutton for punishment and he hired me to do a house for him in the hamptons
and its got a fish
and i keep thinking this is going to be the last fish
its like a drug addict
i say im not going to do it anymore i dont want to do it anymore im not going to do it
and then i do it
there it is
but its the living room
and this piece here is i dont know what it is
i just added it so that wed have enough money in the budget so we could take something out
this is euro disney and ive worked with all of the guys that presented to you earlier
weve had a lot of fun working together
i think im from mars for them and they are for me but somehow we all manage to work together and i think productively
so far
this is a shopping thing
you come into the magic kingdom and the hotel that tony baxters group is doing out here
and then this is a kind of a shopping mall with a rodeo and restaurants
and another restaurant
what i did because of the paris skies being quite dull i made a light grid thats perpendicular to the train station to the route of the train
it looks like its kind of been there and then crashed all these simpler forms into it
the light grid will have a light be lit up at night and give a kind of light ceiling
in switzerland germany actually on the rhine across from basel we did a furniture factory and a furniture museum
and i tried to theres a nick grimshaw building over here theres an oldenburg sculpture over here i tried to make a relationship urbanistically
and i dont gave good slides to show its just been completed but this piece here is this building and these pieces here and here
and as you pass by its always part you see it as all of these pieces accrue and become part of an overall neighborhood
its plaster and just zinc
and you wonder if this is a museum what its going to be like inside
if its going to be so busy and crazy that you wouldnt show anything and just wait
im so cunning and clever i made it quiet and wonderful
but on the outside it does scream out at you a bit
its actually basically three square rooms with a couple of skylights and stuff
and from the building in the back you see it as an iceberg floating by in the hills
i know im over time
see that skylight goes down and becomes that one
so its pretty quiet inside
this is the disney hall the concert hall
its a complicated project
it has a chamber hall
its related to an existing chandler pavilion that was built with a lot of love and tears and caring
and its not a great building but i approached it optimistically that we would make a compositional relationship between us that would strengthen both of us
and the plan of this its a concert hall
this is the foyer which is kind of a garden structure
theres commercial at the ground floor
these are offices which really in the competition we didnt have to design
but finally theres a hotel there
these were the kind of relationships made to the chandler composing these elevations together and relating them to the buildings that existed to moca etc
the acoustician in the competition gave us criteria which led to this compartmentalized scheme which we found out after the competition would not work at all
but everybody liked these forms and liked the space and so thats one of the problems of a competition
you have to then try and get that back in some way
and we studied many models
this was our original model
these were the three buildings that were the ideal the concertgebouw boston and berlin
everybody liked the surround
actually this is the smallest hall in size and it has more seats than any of these because it has double balconies
our client doesnt want balconies so and when we met our new acoustician he told us this was the right shape or this was the right shape
and we tried many shapes trying to get the energy of the original design within an acoustical acceptable format
we finally settled on a shape that was the proportion of the concertgebouw with the sloping outside walls which the acoustician said were crucial to this and later decided they werent but now we have them
and our idea is to make the seating carriage very sculptural and out of wood and like a big boat sitting in this plaster room
thats the idea
and the corners would have skylights and these columns would be structural
and the nice thing about introducing columns is they give you a kind of sense of proscenium from wherever you sit and create intimacy
now this is not a final design these are just on the way to being and so i wouldnt take it literally except the feeling of the space
we studied the acoustics with laser stuff and they bounce them off this and see where it all works
but you get the sense of the hall in section
most halls come straight down into a proscenium
in this case were opening it back up and getting skylights in the four corners
and so it will be quite a different shape
the original building because it was frog like fit nicely on the site and cranked itself well
when you get into a box its harder to do it and here we are struggling with how to put the hotel in
and this is a teapot i designed for alessi
i just stuck it on there
but this is how i do work i do take pieces and bits and look at it and struggle with it and cut it away
and of course its not going to look like that but it is the crazy way i tend to work
and then finally in l a i was asked to do a sculpture at the foot of interstate bank tower the highest building in l a
larry halprin is doing the stairs
and i was asked to do a fish and so i did a snake
its a public space and i made it kind of a garden structure and you can go in it
its a kiva and larrys putting some water in there and it works much better than a fish
in barcelona i was asked to do a fish and were working on that at the foot of a ritz carlton tower being done by skidmore owings and merrill
and the ritz carlton tower is being designed with exposed steel non fire proof much like those old gas tanks
and so we took the language of this exposed steel and used it perverted it into the form of the fish and created a kind of a century contraption that looks like that will sit this is the beach and the harbor out in front and this is really a shopping center with department stores
and we split these bridges
originally this was all solid with a hole in it
we cut them loose and made several bridges and created a kind of a foreground for this hotel
we showed this to the hotel people the other day and they were terrified and said that nobody would come to the ritz carlton anymore because of this fish
and finally i just threw these in lou danziger
i didnt expect lou danziger to be here but this is a building i did for him in i think
a little studio and its sadly for sale
time goes on
and this is my son working with me on a small fast food thing
he designed the robot as the cashier and the head moves and i did the rest of it
and the food wasnt as good as the stuff and so it failed
it should have been the other way around the food should have been good first
it didnt work
thank you very much

title nicholas negroponte taking olpc to colombia title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript ted follows nicholas negroponte to colombia as he delivers laptops inside territory once controlled by guerrillas his partner colombias defense department who see one laptop per child as an investment in the region description
its amazing when you meet a head of state and you say what is your most precious natural resource they will not say children at first
and then when you say children they will pretty quickly agree with you
were traveling today with the minister of defense of colombia head of the army and the head of the police and were dropping off laptops today to children who have no television no telephone and have been in a community cut off from the rest of the world for the past years
the importance of delivering laptops to this region is connecting kids who have otherwise been unconnected because of the farc the guerrillas that started off years ago as a political movement and then became a drug movement
there are one billion children in the world and percent of them dont have electricity at home or at school
and in some countries let me pick afghanistan percent of the little girls dont go to school
and i dont mean that they drop out of school in the third or fourth grade they dont go
so in the three years since i talked at ted and showed a prototype its gone from an idea to a real laptop
we have half a million laptops today in the hands of children
we have about a quarter of a million in transit to those and other children and then there are another quarter of a million more that are being ordered at this moment
so in rough numbers there are a million laptops
thats smaller than i predicted i predicted three to million but is still a very large number
in colombia we have about laptops
its the minister of defense with whom were working not the minister of education because it is seen as a strategic defense issue in the sense of liberating these zones that had been completely closed off in which the people who had been causing if you will years worth of bombings and kidnappings and assassinations lived
and suddenly the kids have connected laptops
theyve leapfrogged
the change is absolutely monumental because its not just opening it up but its opening it up to the rest of the world
so yes theyre building roads yes theyre putting in telephone yes there will be television
but the kids six to years old are surfing the internet in spanish and in local languages so the children grow up with access to information with a window into the rest of the world
before they were closed off
interestingly enough in other countries it will be the minister of finance who sees it as an engine of economic growth
and that engine is going to see the results in years
its not going to happen you know in one year but its an important deeply economic and cultural change that happens through children
thirty one countries in total are involved and in the case of uruguay half the children already have them and by the middle of every single child in uruguay will have a laptop a little green laptop
now what are some of the results
some of the results that go across every single country include teachers saying they have never loved teaching so much and reading comprehension measured by third parties not by us skyrockets
probably the most important thing we see is children teaching parents
they own the laptops they take them home
and so when i met with three children from the schools who had traveled all day to come to bogota one of the three children brought her mother
and the reason she brought her mother is that this six year old child had been teaching her mother how to read and write
her mother had not gone to primary school
and this is such an inversion and such a wonderful example of children being the agents of change
so now in closing people say now why laptops
laptops are a luxury its like giving them ipods no
the reason you want laptops is that the word is education not laptop
this is an education project not a laptop project
they need to learn learning and then just think they can have lets say books
in a village you have laptops each with a different set of books and so that village suddenly has books
you and i didnt have books when we went to primary school
sometimes school is under a tree or in many cases the teacher has only a fifth grade education so you need a collaborative model of learning not just building more schools and training more teachers which you have to do anyway
so were once again doing give one get one
last year we ran a give one get one program and it generated over laptops that we were then able to give free
and by being a zero dollar laptop we can go to countries that cant afford it at all
and thats what we did we went to haiti we went to rwanda afghanistan ethiopia mongolia
places that are not markets seeding it with the principles of saturation connectivity low ages etc
and then we can actually roll out large numbers
so think of it this way think of it as inoculating children against ignorance
and think of the laptop as a vaccine
you dont vaccinate a few children
you vaccinate all the children in an area

title nate silver does racism affect how you vote title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript nate silver has data that answers big questions about race in politics for instance in the presidential race did obamas skin color actually keep him from getting votes in some parts of the country stats and myths collide in this fascinating talk that ends with a remarkable insight description
i want to talk about the election
for the first time in the united states a predominantly white group of voters voted for an african american candidate for president
and in fact barack obama did quite well
he won electoral votes
and he won about million popular votes more than any other presidential candidate of any race of any party in history
if you compare how obama did against how john kerry had done four years earlier democrats really like seeing this transition here where almost every state becomes bluer becomes more democratic even states obama lost like out west those states became more blue
in the south in the northeast almost everywhere but with a couple of exceptions here and there
one exception is in massachusetts
that was john kerrys home state
no big surprise obama couldnt do better than kerry there
or in arizona which is john mccains home obama didnt have much improvement
but there is also this part of the country kind of in the middle region here
this kind of arkansas tennessee oklahoma west virginia region
now if you look at bill clinton the last democrat to actually win how he did in you see real big differences in this part of the country right here the kind of appalachians ozarks highlands region as i call it or point swings from how bill clinton did in to how obama did in
yes bill clinton was from arkansas but these are very very profound differences
so when we think about parts of the country like arkansas you know
there is a book written called whats the matter with kansas
but really the question here obama did relatively well in kansas
he lost badly but every democrat does
he lost no worse than most people do
but yeah whats the matter with arkansas
and when we think of arkansas we tend to have pretty negative connotations
we think of a bunch of rednecks quote unquote with guns
and we think people like this probably dont want to vote for people who look like this and are named barack obama
we think its a matter of race and is this fair
are we kind of stigmatizing people from arkansas and this part of the country
and the answer is it is at least partially fair
we know that race was a factor and the reason why we know that is because we asked those people
actually we didnt ask them but when they conducted exit polls in every state in states out of the they asked a question that was pretty direct about race
they asked this question
in deciding your vote for president today was the race of the candidate a factor
were looking for people that said yes race was a factor moreover it was an important factor in my decision and people who voted for john mccain as a result of that factor maybe in combination with other factors and maybe alone
were looking for this behavior among white voters or really non black voters
so you see big differences in different parts of the country on this question
in louisiana about one in five white voters said yes one of the big reasons why i voted against barack obama is because he was an african american
if those people had voted for obama even half of them obama would have won louisiana safely
same is true with i think all of these states you see on the top of the list
meanwhile california new york we can say oh were enlightened but you know certainly a much lower incidence of this admitted i suppose manifestation of racially based voting
here is the same data on a map
you kind of see the relationship between the redder states of where more people responded and said yes barack obamas race was a problem for me
you see comparing the map to you see an overlap here
this really seems to explain why barack obama did worse in this one part of the country
so we have to ask why
is racism predictable in some way
is there something driving this
is it just about some weird stuff that goes on in arkansas that we dont understand and kentucky
or are there more systematic factors at work
and so we can look at a bunch of different variables
these are things that economists and political scientists look at all the time things like income and religion education
which of these seem to drive this manifestation of racism in this big national experiment we had on november
and there are a couple of these that have strong predictive relationships one of which is education where you see the states with the fewest years of schooling per adult are in red and you see this part of the country the kind of appalachians region is less educated its just a fact
and you see the relationship there with the racially based voting patterns
the other variable thats important is the type of neighborhood that you live in
states that are more rural even to some extent of the states like new hampshire and maine they exhibit a little bit of this racially based voting against barack obama
so its the combination of these two things its education and the type of neighbors that you have which well talk about more in a moment
and the thing about states like arkansas and tennessee is that theyre both very rural and they are educationally impoverished
so yes racism is predictable
these things among maybe other variables but these things seem to predict it
were going to drill down a little bit more now into something called the general social survey
this is conducted by the university of chicago every other year
and they ask a series of really interesting questions
in they had particularly interesting questions about racial attitudes
one simple question they asked is does anyone of the opposite race live in your neighborhood
we can see in different types of communities that the results are quite different
in cites about percent of people have someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race but in rural communities only about percent
probably because if you live on a farm you might not have a lot of neighbors period
but nevertheless youre not having a lot of interaction with people who are unlike you
so what were going to do now is take the white people in the survey and split them between those who have black neighbors or really some neighbor of another race and people who have only white neighbors
and we see in some variables in terms of political attitudes not a lot of difference
this was eight years ago some people were more republican back then
but you see democrats versus republican not a big difference based on who your neighbors are
and even some questions about race for example affirmative action which is kind of a political question a policy question about race if you will not much difference here
affirmative action is not very popular frankly with white voters period
but people with black neighbors and people with mono racial neighborhoods feel no differently about it really
but if you probe a bit deeper and get a bit more personal if you will do you favor a law banning interracial marriage
there is a big difference
people who dont have neighbors of a different race are about twice as likely to oppose interracial marriage as people who do
just based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you
and likewise they asked not in but in the same survey in would you not vote for a qualified black president
you see people without neighbors who are african american who were much more likely to say that would give me a problem
so its really not even about urban versus rural
its about who you live with
racism is predictable and its predicted by interaction or lack thereof with people unlike you people of other races
so if you want to address it the goal is to facilitate interaction with people of other races
i have a couple of very obvious i suppose ideas for maybe how to do that
im a big fan of cities
especially if we have cites that are diverse and sustainable and can support people of different ethnicities and different income groups
i think cities facilitate more of the kind of networking the kind of casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis
but also not everyone wants to live in a city certainly not a city like new york
so we can think more about things like street grids
this is the neighborhood where i grew up in east lansing michigan
its a traditional midwestern community which means you have real grid
you have real neighborhoods and real trees and real streets you can walk on
and you interact a lot with your neighbors people you like people you might not know
and as a result its a very tolerant community which is different i think than something like this which is in schaumburg illinois where every little set of houses has their own cul de sac and drive through starbucks and stuff like that
i think that actually this type of urban design which became more prevalent in the and i think there is a relationship between that and the country becoming more conservative under ronald reagan
but also here is another idea we have is an intercollegiate exchange program where you have students going from new york abroad
but frankly there are enough differences within the country now where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from nyu have them go study for a semester at the university of arkansas and vice versa do it at the high school level
literally there are people who might be in school in arkansas or tennessee and might never interact in a positive affirmative way with someone from another part of the country or of another racial group
i think part of the education variable we talked about before is the networking experience you get when you go to college where you do get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise
but the point is this is all good news because when something is predictable it is what i call designable
you can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem even if the problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism
if we understand the root causes of the behavior and where it manifests itself and where it doesnt we can start to design solutions to it
so thats all i have to say thank you very much

title denis dutton a darwinian theory of beauty title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript ted collaborates with animator andrew park to illustrate denis duttons provocative theory on beauty that art music and other beautiful things far from being simply in the eye of the beholder are a core part of human nature with deep evolutionary origins description
delighted to be here and to talk to you about a subject dear to my heart which is beauty
i do the philosophy of art aesthetics actually for a living
i try to figure out intellectually philosophically psychologically what the experience of beauty is what sensibly can be said about it and how people go off the rails in trying to understand it
now this is an extremely complicated subject in part because the things that we call beautiful are so different
i mean just think of the sheer variety a babys face berliozs harold in italy movies like the wizard of oz or the plays of chekhov a central california landscape a hokusai view of mt fuji der rosenkavalier a stunning match winning goal in a world cup soccer match van goghs starry night a jane austen novel fred astaire dancing across the screen
this brief list includes human beings natural landforms works of art and skilled human actions
an account that explains the presence of beauty in everything on this list is not going to be easy
i can however give you at least a taste of what i regard as the most powerful theory of beauty we yet have
and we get it not from a philosopher of art not from a postmodern art theorist or a bigwig art critic
no this theory comes from an expert on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding and you know who i mean charles darwin
of course a lot of people think they already know the proper answer to the question what is beauty
its in the eye of the beholder
its whatever moves you personally
or as some people especially academics prefer beauty is in the culturally conditioned eye of the beholder
people agree that paintings or movies or music are beautiful because their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste
taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures with great ease
beethoven is adored in japan
peruvians love japanese woodblock prints
inca sculptures are regarded as treasures in british museums while shakespeare is translated into every major language of the earth
or just think about american jazz or american movies they go everywhere
there are many differences among the arts but there are also universal cross cultural aesthetic pleasures and values
how can we explain this universality
the best answer lies in trying to reconstruct a darwinian evolutionary history of our artistic and aesthetic tastes
we need to reverse engineer our present artistic tastes and preferences and explain how they came to be engraved in our minds by the actions of both our prehistoric largely pleistocene environments where we became fully human but also by the social situations in which we evolved
this reverse engineering can also enlist help from the human record preserved in prehistory
i mean fossils cave paintings and so forth
and it should take into account what we know of the aesthetic interests of isolated hunter gatherer bands that survived into the and the centuries
now i personally have no doubt whatsoever that the experience of beauty with its emotional intensity and pleasure belongs to our evolved human psychology
the experience of beauty is one component in a whole series of darwinian adaptations
beauty is an adaptive effect which we extend and intensify in the creation and enjoyment of works of art and entertainment
as many of you will know evolution operates by two main primary mechanisms
the first of these is natural selection thats random mutation and selective retention along with our basic anatomy and physiology the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails
natural selection also explains many basic revulsions such as the horrid smell of rotting meat or fears such as the fear of snakes or standing close to the edge of a cliff
natural selection also explains pleasures sexual pleasure our liking for sweet fat and proteins which in turn explains a lot of popular foods from ripe fruits through chocolate malts and barbecued ribs
the other great principle of evolution is sexual selection and it operates very differently
the peacocks magnificent tail is the most famous example of this
it did not evolve for natural survival
in fact it goes against natural survival
no the peacocks tail results from the mating choices made by peahens
its quite a familiar story
its women who actually push history forward
darwin himself by the way had no doubts that the peacocks tail was beautiful in the eyes of the peahen
he actually used that word
now keeping these ideas firmly in mind we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination even obsession in order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction
beauty is natures way of acting at a distance so to speak
i mean you cant expect to eat an adaptively beneficial landscape
it would hardly do to eat your baby or your lover
so evolutions trick is to make them beautiful to have them exert a kind of magnetism to give you the pleasure of simply looking at them
consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure the magnetic pull of beautiful landscapes
people in very different cultures all over the world tend to like a particular kind of landscape a landscape that just happens to be similar to the pleistocene savannas where we evolved
this landscape shows up today on calendars on postcards in the design of golf courses and public parks and in gold framed pictures that hang in living rooms from new york to new zealand
its a kind of hudson river school landscape featuring open spaces of low grasses interspersed with copses of trees
the trees by the way are often preferred if they fork near the ground that is to say if theyre trees you could scramble up if you were in a tight fix
the landscape shows the presence of water directly in view or evidence of water in a bluish distance indications of animal or bird life as well as diverse greenery and finally get this a path or a road perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline that extends into the distance almost inviting you to follow it
this landscape type is regarded as beautiful even by people in countries that dont have it
the ideal savanna landscape is one of the clearest examples where human beings everywhere find beauty in similar visual experience
but someone might argue thats natural beauty
how about artistic beauty
isnt that exhaustively cultural
no i dont think it is
and once again id like to look back to prehistory to say something about it
it is widely assumed that the earliest human artworks are the stupendously skillful cave paintings that we all know from lascaux and chauvet
chauvet caves are about years old along with a few small realistic sculptures of women and animals from the same period
but artistic and decorative skills are actually much older than that
beautiful shell necklaces that look like something youd see at an arts and crafts fair as well as ochre body paint have been found from around years ago
but the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts are older even than this
i have in mind the so called acheulian hand axes
the oldest stone tools are choppers from the olduvai gorge in east africa
they go back about two and a half million years
these crude tools were around for thousands of centuries until around million years ago when homo erectus started shaping single thin stone blades sometimes rounded ovals but often in what are to our eyes an arresting symmetrical pointed leaf or teardrop form
these acheulian hand axes theyre named after st acheul in france where finds were made in century have been unearthed in their thousands scattered across asia europe and africa almost everywhere homo erectus and homo ergaster roamed
now the sheer numbers of these hand axes shows that they cant have been made for butchering animals
and the plot really thickens when you realize that unlike other pleistocene tools the hand axes often exhibit no evidence of wear on their delicate blade edges
and some in any event are too big to use for butchery
their symmetry their attractive materials and above all their meticulous workmanship are simply quite beautiful to our eyes even today
so what were these ancient i mean theyre ancient theyre foreign but theyre at the same time somehow familiar
what were these artifacts for
the best available answer is that they were literally the earliest known works of art practical tools transformed into captivating aesthetic objects contemplated both for their elegant shape and their virtuoso craftsmanship
hand axes mark an evolutionary advance in human history tools fashioned to function as what darwinians call fitness signals that is to say displays that are performances like the peacocks tail except that unlike hair and feathers the hand axes are consciously cleverly crafted
competently made hand axes indicated desirable personal qualities intelligence fine motor control planning ability conscientiousness and sometimes access to rare materials
over tens of thousands of generations such skills increased the status of those who displayed them and gained a reproductive advantage over the less capable
you know its an old line but it has been shown to work why dont you come up to my cave so i can show you my hand axes
except of course whats interesting about this is that we cant be sure how that idea was conveyed because the homo erectus that made these objects did not have language
its hard to grasp but its an incredible fact
this object was made by a hominid ancestor homo erectus or homo ergaster between and years before language
stretching over a million years the hand axe tradition is the longest artistic tradition in human and proto human history
by the end of the hand axe epic homo sapiens as they were then called finally were doubtless finding new ways to amuse and amaze each other by who knows telling jokes storytelling dancing or hairstyling
yes hairstyling i insist on that
for us moderns virtuoso technique is used to create imaginary worlds in fiction and in movies to express intense emotions with music painting and dance
but still one fundamental trait of the ancestral personality persists in our aesthetic cravings the beauty we find in skilled performances
from lascaux to the louvre to carnegie hall human beings have a permanent innate taste for virtuoso displays in the arts
we find beauty in something done well
so the next time you pass a jewelry shop window displaying a beautifully cut teardrop shaped stone dont be so sure its just your culture telling you that that sparkling jewel is beautiful
your distant ancestors loved that shape and found beauty in the skill needed to make it even before they could put their love into words
is beauty in the eye of the beholder
no its deep in our minds
its a gift handed down from the intelligent skills and rich emotional lives of our most ancient ancestors
our powerful reaction to images to the expression of emotion in art to the beauty of music to the night sky will be with us and our descendants for as long as the human race exists
thank you

title lawrence lessig we the people and the republic we must reclaim title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript there is a corruption at the heart of american politics caused by the dependence of congressional candidates on funding from the tiniest percentage of citizens thats the argument at the core of this blistering talk by legal scholar lawrence lessig with rapid fire visuals he shows how the funding process weakens the republic in the most fundamental way and issues a rallying bipartisan cry that will resonate with many in the u s and beyond description
once upon a time there was a place called lesterland
now lesterland looks a lot like the united states
like the united states it has about million people and of that million people it turns out are called lester
if matts in the audience i just borrowed that ill return it in a second this character from your series
so are called lester which means about percent is named lester
now lesters in lesterland have this extraordinary power
there are two elections every election cycle in lesterland
one is called the general election
the other is called the lester election
and in the general election its the citizens who get to vote but in the lester election its the lesters who get to vote
and heres the trick
in order to run in the general election you must do extremely well in the lester election
you dont necessarily have to win but you must do extremely well
now what can we say about democracy in lesterland
as the supreme court said in citizens united that people have the ultimate influence over elected officials because after all there is a general election but only after the lesters have had their way with the candidates who wish to run in the general election
and number two obviously this dependence upon the lesters is going to produce a subtle understated we could say camouflaged bending to keep the lesters happy
okay so we have a democracy no doubt but its dependent upon the lesters and dependent upon the people
it has competing dependencies we could say conflicting dependencies depending upon who the lesters are
okay thats lesterland
now there are three things i want you to see now that ive described lesterland
number one the united states is lesterland
the united states is lesterland
the united states also looks like this also has two elections one we called the general election the second we should call the money election
in the general election its the citizens who get to vote if youre over in some states if you have an id
in the money election its the funders who get to vote the funders who get to vote and just like in lesterland the trick is to run in the general election you must do extremely well in the money election
you dont necessarily have to win there is jerry brown
but you must do extremely well
and heres the key there are just as few relevant funders in usa land as there are lesters in lesterland
now you say really
really percent
well here are the numbers from percent of america gave dollars or more to any federal candidate percent gave the maximum amount to any federal candidate percent the one percent of the one percent gave dollars or more to federal candidates and in this election cycle my favorite statistic is percent for those of you doing the numbers you know thats americans gave percent of the super pac money spent in the cycle we have just seen ending
so im just a lawyer i look at this range of numbers and i say its fair for me to say its percent who are our relevant funders in america
in this sense the funders are our lesters
now what can we say about this democracy in usa land
well as the supreme court said in citizens united we could say of course the people have the ultimate influence over the elected officials we have a general election but only after the funders have had their way with the candidates who wish to run in that general election
and number two obviously this dependence upon the funders produces a subtle understated camouflaged bending to keep the funders happy
candidates for congress and members of congress spend between and percent of their time raising money to get back to congress or to get their party back into power and the question we need to ask is what does it do to them these humans as they spend their time behind the telephone calling people theyve never met but calling the tiniest slice of the one percent
as anyone would as they do this they develop a sixth sense a constant awareness about how what they do might affect their ability to raise money
they become in the words of the x files shape shifters as they constantly adjust their views in light of what they know will help them to raise money not on issues one to but on issues to
leslie byrne a democrat from virginia describes that when she went to congress she was told by a colleague always lean to the green
then to clarify she went on he was not an environmentalist
so here too we have a democracy a democracy dependent upon the funders and dependent upon the people competing dependencies possibly conflicting dependencies depending upon who the funders are
okay the united states is lesterland point number one
heres point number two
the united states is worse than lesterland worse than lesterland because you can imagine in lesterland if we lesters got a letter from the government that said hey you get to pick who gets to run in the general election we would think maybe of a kind of aristocracy of lesters
you know there are lesters from every part of social society
there are rich lesters poor lesters black lesters white lesters not many women lesters but put that to the side for one second
we have lesters from everywhere we could think what could we do to make lesterland better
its at least possible the lesters would act for the good of lesterland
but in our land in this land in usa land there are certainly some sweet lesters out there many of them in this room here today but the vast majority of lesters act for the lesters because the shifting coalitions that are comprising the percent are not comprising it for the public interest
its for their private interest in this sense the usa is worse than lesterland
and finally point number three whatever one wants to say about lesterland against the background of its history its traditions in our land in usa land lesterland is a corruption a corruption
now by corruption i dont mean brown paper bag cash secreted among members of congress
i dont mean rod blagojevich sense of corruption
i dont mean any criminal act
the corruption im talking about is perfectly legal
its a corruption relative to the framers baseline for this republic
the framers gave us what they called a republic but by a republic they meant a representative democracy and by a representative democracy they meant a government as madison put it in federalist that would have a branch that would be dependent upon the people alone
so heres the model of government
they have the people and the government with this exclusive dependency but the problem here is that congress has evolved a different dependence no longer a dependence upon the people alone increasingly a dependence upon the funders
now this is a dependence too but its different and conflicting from a dependence upon the people alone so long as the funders are not the people
this is a corruption
now theres good news and bad news about this corruption
one bit of good news is that its bipartisan equal opportunity corruption
it blocks the left on a whole range of issues that we on the left really care about
it blocks the right too as it makes principled arguments of the right increasingly impossible
so the right wants smaller government
when al gore was vice president his team had an idea for deregulating a significant portion of the telecommunications industry
the chief policy man took this idea to capitol hill and as he reported back to me the response was hell no
if we deregulate these guys how are we going to raise money from them
this is a system thats designed to save the status quo including the status quo of big and invasive government
it works against the left and the right and that you might say is good news
but heres the bad news
its a pathological democracy destroying corruption because in any system where the members are dependent upon the tiniest fraction of us for their election that means the tiniest number of us the tiniest tiniest number of us can block reform
i know that should have been like a rock or something
i can only find cheese im sorry so there it is
block reform
because there is an economy here an economy of influence an economy with lobbyists at the center which feeds on polarization
it feeds on dysfunction
the worse that it is for us the better that it is for this fundraising
henry david thoreau there are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root
this is the root
okay now every single one of you knows this
you couldnt be here if you didnt know this yet you ignore it
you ignore it this is an impossible problem
you focus on the possible problems like eradicating polio from the world or taking an image of every single street across the globe or building the first real universal translator or building a fusion factory in your garage
these are the manageable problems so you ignore so you ignore this corruption
but we cannot ignore this corruption anymore
we need a government that works
and not works for the left or the right but works for the left and the right the citizens of the left and right because there is no sensible reform possible until we end this corruption
so i want you to take hold to grab the issue you care the most about
climate change is mine but it might be financial reform or a simpler tax system or inequality
grab that issue sit it down in front of you look straight in its eyes and tell it there is no christmas this year
there will never be a christmas
we will never get your issue solved until we fix this issue first
so its not that mine is the most important issue its not
yours is the most important issue but mine is the first issue the issue we have to solve before we get to fix the issues you care about
no sensible reform and we cannot afford a world a future with no sensible reform
okay so how do we do it
turns out the analytics here are easy simple
if the problem is members spending an extraordinary amount of time fundraising from the tiniest slice of america the solution is to have them spend less time fundraising but fundraise from a wider slice of americans to spread it out to spread the funder influence so that we restore the idea of dependence upon the people alone
and to do this does not require a constitutional amendment changing the first amendment
to do this would require a single statute a statute establishing what we think of as small dollar funded elections a statute of citizen funded campaigns and theres any number of these proposals out there fair elections now act the american anti corruption act an idea in my book that i call the grant and franklin project to give vouchers to people to fund elections an idea of john sarbanes called the grassroots democracy act
each of these would fix this corruption by spreading out the influence of funders to all of us
the analytics are easy here
its the politics thats hard indeed impossibly hard because this reform would shrink k street and capitol hill as congressman jim cooper a democrat from tennessee put it has become a farm league for k street a farm league for k street
members and staffers and bureaucrats have an increasingly common business model in their head a business model focused on their life after government their life as lobbyists
fifty percent of the senate between and left to become lobbyists percent of the house
those numbers have only gone up and as united republic calculated last april the average increase in salary for those who they tracked was percent
so its fair to ask how is it possible for them to change this
now i get this skepticism
i get this cynicism i get this sense of impossibility
but i dont buy it
this is a solvable issue
if you think about the issues our parents tried to solve in the century issues like racism or sexism or the issue that weve been fighting in this century homophobia those are hard issues
you dont wake up one day no longer a racist
it takes generations to tear that intuition that dna out of the soul of a people
but this is a problem of just incentives just incentives
change the incentives and the behavior changes and the states that have adopted small dollar funded systems have seen overnight a change in the practice
when connecticut adopted this system in the very first year percent of elected representatives gave up large contributions and took small contributions only
its solvable not by being a democrat not by being a republican
its solvable by being citizens by being citizens by being tedizens
because if you want to kickstart reform look i could kickstart reform at half the price of fixing energy policy i could give you back a republic
okay but even if youre not yet with me even if you believe this is impossible what the five years since i spoke at ted has taught me as ive spoken about this issue again and again is even if you think its impossible that is irrelevant
irrelevant
i spoke at dartmouth once and a woman stood up after i spoke i write in my book and she said to me professor youve convinced me this is hopeless hopeless
theres nothing we can do
when she said that i scrambled
i tried to think how do i respond to that hopelessness
what is that sense of hopelessness
and what hit me was an image of my six year old son
and i imagined a doctor coming to me and saying your son has terminal brain cancer and theres nothing you can do
nothing you can do
so would i do nothing
would i just sit there accept it okay nothing i can do
im going off to build google glass
of course not i would do everything i could and i would do everything i could because this is what love means that the odds are irrelevant and that you do whatever the hell you can the odds be damned
and then i saw the obvious link because even we liberals love this country
and so when the pundits and the politicians say that change is impossible what this love of country says back is thats just irrelevant
we lose something dear something everyone in this room loves and cherishes if we lose this republic and so we act with everything we can to prove these pundits wrong
so heres my question do you have that love
do you have that love
because if you do then what the hell are you what are the hell are we doing
when ben franklin was carried from the constitutional convention in september of he was stopped in the street by a woman who said mr franklin what have you wrought
franklin said a republic madam if you can keep it
a republic a representative democracy
a government dependent upon the people alone
we have lost that republic
all of us have to act to get it back
thank you very much
thank you thank you thank you

title martin rees is this our final century title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript speaking as both an astronomer and a concerned member of the human race sir martin rees examines our planet and its future from a cosmic perspective he urges action to prevent dark consequences from our scientific and technological development description
if you take people at random have something in common their interests in business lie on or near the earths surface
the odd one out is an astronomer and i am one of that strange breed
my talk will be in two parts ill talk first as an astronomer and then as a worried member of the human race
but lets start off by remembering that darwin showed how were the outcome of four billion years of evolution
and what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology is to go back before darwins simple beginning to set our earth in a cosmic context
and let me just run through a few slides
this was the impact that happened last week on a comet
if theyd sent a nuke it would have been rather more spectacular than what actually happened last monday
so thats another project for nasa
thats mars from the european mars express and at new year
this artists impression turned into reality when a parachute landed on titan saturns giant moon
it landed on the surface this is pictures taken on the way down
that looks like a coastline
it is indeed but the ocean is liquid methane the temperature minus degrees centigrade
if we go beyond our solar system weve learned that the stars arent twinkly points of light
each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it
and we can see places where stars are forming like the eagle nebula we see stars dying
in six billion years the sun will look like that
and some stars die spectacularly in a supernova explosion leaving remnants like that
on a still bigger scale we see entire galaxies of stars
we see entire ecosystems where gas is being recycled
and to the cosmologist these galaxies are just the atoms as it were of the large scale universe
this picture shows a patch of sky so small that it would take about patches like it to cover the full moon in the sky
through a small telescope this would look quite blank but you see here hundreds of little faint smudges
each is a galaxy fully like ours or andromeda which looks so small and faint because its light has taken billion light years to get to us
the stars in those galaxies probably dont have planets around them
theres scant chance of life there thats because theres been no time for the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron the building blocks of planets and of life
we believe that all of this emerged from a big bang a hot dense state so how did that amorphous big bang turn into our complex cosmos
im going to show you a movie simulation powers of faster than real time which shows a patch of the universe where the expansions have subtracted out
but you see as time goes on in gigayears at the bottom you will see structures evolve as gravity feeds on small dense irregularities and structures develop
and well end up after billion years with something looking rather like our own universe
and we compare simulated universes like that ill show you a better simulation at the end of my talk with what we actually see in the sky
well we can trace things back to the earlier stages of the big bang but we still dont know what banged and why it banged
thats a challenge for century science
if my research group had a logo it would be this picture here an ouroboros where you see the micro world on the left the world of the quantum and on the right the large scale universe of planets stars and galaxies
we know our universes are united though links between left and right
the everyday world is determined by atoms how they stick together to make molecules
stars are fueled by how the nuclei in those atoms react together
and as weve learned in the last few years galaxies are held together by the gravitational pull of so called dark matter particles in huge swarms far smaller even than atomic nuclei
but wed like to know the synthesis symbolized at the very top
the micro world of the quantum is understood
on the right hand side gravity holds sway einstein explained that
but the unfinished business for century science is to link together cosmos and micro world with a unified theory symbolized as it were gastronomically at the top of that picture
and until we have that synthesis we wont be able to understand the very beginning of our universe because when our universe was itself the size of an atom quantum effects could shake everything
and so we need a theory that unifies the very large and the very small which we dont yet have
one idea incidentally and i had this hazard sign to say im going to speculate from now on is that our big bang was not the only one
one idea is that our three dimensional universe may be embedded in a high dimensional space just as you can imagine on these sheets of paper
you can imagine ants on one of them thinking its a two dimensional universe not being aware of another population of ants on the other
so there could be another universe just a millimeter away from ours but were not aware of it because that millimeter is measured in some fourth spatial dimension and were imprisoned in our three
and so we believe that there may be a lot more to physical reality than what weve normally called our universe the aftermath of our big bang and heres another picture
bottom right depicts our universe which on the horizon is not beyond that but even that is just one bubble as it were in some vaster reality
many people suspect that just as weve gone from believing in one solar system to zillions of solar systems one galaxy to many galaxies we have to go to many big bangs from one big bang perhaps these many big bangs displaying an immense variety of properties
well lets go back to this picture
theres one challenge symbolized at the top but theres another challenge to science symbolized at the bottom
you want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small but we want to understand the very complex
and the most complex things are ourselves midway between atoms and stars
we depend on stars to make the atoms were made of
we depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure
we clearly have to be large compared to atoms to have layer upon layer of complex structure
we clearly have to be small compared to stars and planets otherwise wed be crushed by gravity and in fact we are midway
it would take as many human bodies to make up the sun as there are atoms in each of us
the geometric mean of the mass of a proton and the mass of the sun is kilograms within a factor of two of the mass of each person here
well most of you anyway
the science of complexity is probably the greatest challenge of all greater than that of the very small on the left and the very large on the right
and its this science which is not only enlightening our understanding of the biological world but also transforming our world faster than ever
and more than that its engendering new kinds of change
and i now move on to the second part of my talk and the book our final century was mentioned
if i was not a self effacing brit i would mention the book myself and i would add that its available in paperback
and in america it was called our final hour because americans like instant gratification
but my theme is that in this century not only has science changed the world faster than ever but in new and different ways
targeted drugs genetic modification artificial intelligence perhaps even implants into our brains may change human beings themselves and human beings their physique and character has not changed for thousands of years
it may change this century
its new in our history
and the human impact on the global environment greenhouse warming mass extinctions and so forth is unprecedented too
and so this makes this coming century a challenge
bio and cybertechnologies are environmentally benign in that they offer marvelous prospects while nonetheless reducing pressure on energy and resources
but they will have a dark side
in our interconnected world novel technology could empower just one fanatic or some weirdo with a mindset of those who now design computer viruses to trigger some kind on disaster
indeed catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure error rather than terror
and even a tiny probability of catastrophe is unacceptable when the downside could be of global consequence
in fact some years ago bill joy wrote an article expressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over etc
i dont go along with all that but its interesting that he had a simple solution
it was what he called fine grained relinquishment
he wanted to give up the dangerous kind of science and keep the good bits now thats absurdly naive for two reasons
first any scientific discovery has benign consequences as well as dangerous ones
and also when a scientist makes a discovery he or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be
and so what this means is that we have to accept the risks if we are going to enjoy the benefits of science
we have to accept that there will be hazards
and i think we have to go back to what happened in the post war era post world war ii when the nuclear scientists whod been involved in making the atomic bomb in many cases were concerned that they should do all they could to alert the world to the dangers
and they were inspired not by the young einstein who did the great work in relativity but by the old einstein the icon of poster and t shirt who failed in his scientific efforts to unify the physical laws
he was premature but he was a moral compass an inspiration to scientists who were concerned with arms control
and perhaps the greatest living person is someone im privileged to know joe rothblatt
equally untidy office there as you can see
hes years old and he founded the pugwash movement
he persuaded einstein as his last act to sign the famous memorandum of bertrand russell
and he sets an example of the concerned scientist
and i think to harness science optimally to choose which doors to open and which to leave closed we need latter day counterparts of people like joseph rothblatt
we need not just campaigning physicists but we need biologists computer experts and environmentalists as well
and i think academics and independent entrepreneurs have a special obligation because they have more freedom than those in government service or company employees subject to commercial pressure
i wrote my book our final century as a scientist just a general scientist but theres one respect i think in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective and thats that it offers an awareness of the immense future
the stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past are now part of common culture outside the american bible belt anyway but most people even those who are familiar with evolution arent mindful that even more time lies ahead
the sun has been shining for four and a half billion years but itll be another six billion years before its fuel runs out
on that schematic picture a sort of time lapse picture were halfway
and itll be another six billion before that happens and any remaining life on earth is vaporized
theres an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there experiencing the suns demise but any life and intelligence that exists then will be as different from us as we are from bacteria
the unfolding of intelligence and complexity still has immensely far to go here on earth and probably far beyond
so we are still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity in our earth and beyond
if you represent the earths lifetime by a single year say from january when it was made to december the century would be a quarter of a second in june a tiny fraction of the year
but even in this concertinaed cosmic perspective our century is very very special the first when humans can change themselves and their home planet
as i should have shown this earlier it will not be humans who witness the end point of the sun it will be creatures as different from us as we are from bacteria
when einstein died in one striking tribute to his global status was this cartoon by herblock in the washington post
the plaque reads albert einstein lived here
and id like to end with a vignette as it were inspired by this image
weve been familiar for years with this image the fragile beauty of land ocean and clouds contrasted with the sterile moonscape on which the astronauts left their footprints
but lets suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot in the cosmos from afar not just for years but for the entire billion year history of our earth
what would they have seen
over nearly all that immense time earths appearance would have changed very gradually
the only abrupt worldwide change would have been major asteroid impacts or volcanic super eruptions
apart from those brief traumas nothing happens suddenly
the continental landmasses drifted around
ice cover waxed and waned
successions of new species emerged evolved and became extinct
but in just a tiny sliver of the earths history the last one millionth part a few thousand years the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before
this signaled the start of agriculture
change has accelerated as human populations rose
then other things happened even more abruptly
within just years thats one hundredth of one millionth of the earths age the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise and ominously fast
the planet became an intense emitter of radio waves the total output from all tv and cell phones and radar transmissions and something else happened
metallic objects albeit very small ones a few tons at most escaped into orbit around the earth
some journeyed to the moons and planets
a race of advanced extraterrestrials watching our solar system from afar could confidently predict earths final doom in another six billion years
but could they have predicted this unprecedented spike less than halfway through the earths life
these human induced alterations occupying overall less than a millionth of the elapsed lifetime and seemingly occurring with runaway speed
if they continued their vigil what might these hypothetical aliens witness in the next hundred years
will some spasm foreclose earths future
or will the biosphere stabilize
or will some of the metallic objects launched from the earth spawn new oases a post human life elsewhere
the science done by the young einstein will continue as long as our civilization but for civilization to survive well need the wisdom of the old einstein humane global and farseeing
and whatever happens in this uniquely crucial century will resonate into the remote future and perhaps far beyond the earth far beyond the earth as depicted here
thank you very much

title gary greenberg the beautiful nano details of our world title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript when photographed under a microscope grains of sand appear like colorful pieces of candy and the stamens in a flower become like fantastical spires at an amusement park gary greenberg reveals the thrilling details of the micro world description
so i want to talk a little bit about seeing the world from a totally unique point of view and this world im going to talk about is the micro world
ive found after doing this for many many years that theres a magical world behind reality
and that can be seen directly through a microscope and im going to show you some of this today
so lets start off looking at something rather not so small something that we can see with our naked eye and thats a bee so when you look at this bee its about this size here its about a centimeter
but to really see the details of the bee and really appreciate what it is you have to look a little bit closer
so thats just the eye of the bee with a microscope and now all of a sudden you can see that the bee has thousands of individual eyes called ommatidia and they actually have sensory hairs in their eyes so they know when theyre right up close to something because they cant see in stereo
as we go smaller here is a human hair
a human hair is about the smallest thing that the eye can see
its about a tenth of a millimeter
and as we go smaller again about ten times smaller than that is a cell
so you could fit human cells across the diameter of a human hair
so when we would look at cells this is how i really got involved in biology and science is by looking at living cells in the microscope
when i first saw living cells in a microscope i was absolutely enthralled and amazed at what they looked like
so if you look at the cell like that from the immune system theyre actually moving all over the place
this cell is looking for foreign objects bacteria things that it can find
and its looking around and when it finds something and recognizes it being foreign it will actually engulf it and eat it
so if you look right there it finds that little bacterium and it engulfs it and eats it
if you take some heart cells from an animal and put it in a dish theyll just sit there and beat
thats their job every cell has a mission in life and these cells the mission is to move blood around our body
these next cells are nerve cells and right now as we see and understand what were looking at our brains and our nerve cells are actually doing this right now theyre not just static theyre moving around making new connections and thats what happens when we learn
as you go farther down this scale here thats a micron or a micrometer and we go all the way down to here to a nanometer and an angstrom now an angstrom is the size of the diameter of a hydrogen atom
thats how small that is
and microscopes that we have today can actually see individual atoms so these are some pictures of individual atoms each bump here is an individual atom
this is a ring of cobalt atoms
so this whole world the nano world this area in here is called the nano world and the nano world the whole micro world that we see theres a nano world that is wrapped up within that and the whole and that is the world of molecules and atoms
but i want to talk about this larger world the world of the micro world
so if you were a little tiny bug living in a flower what would that flower look like if the flower was this big
it wouldnt look or feel like anything that we see when we look at a flower so if you look at this flower here and youre a little bug if youre on that surface of that flower thats what the terrain would look like
the petal of that flower looks like that so the ant is kind of crawling over these objects and if you look a little bit closer at this stigma and the stamen here this is the style of that flower and you notice that its got these little these are like little jelly like things that are what are called spurs these are nectar spurs
so this little ant thats crawling here its like its in a little willy wonka land
its like a little disneyland for them its not like what we see
these are little bits of individual grain of pollen there and there and here is a what you see as one little yellow dot of pollen when you look in a microscope its actually made of thousands of little grains of pollen
so this for example when you see bees flying around these little plants and theyre collecting pollen those pollen grains that theyre collecting they pack into their legs and they take it back to the hive and thats what makes the beehive the wax in the beehive and theyre also collecting nectar and thats what makes the honey that we eat
heres a close up picture or this is actually a regular picture of a water hyacinth and if you had really really good vision with your naked eye youd see it about that well
theres the stamen and the pistil but look what the stamen and the pistil look like in a microscope thats the stamen
so thats thousands of little grains of pollen there and theres the pistil there and these are the little things called trichomes and thats what makes the flower give a fragrance and plants actually communicate with one another through their fragrances
i want to talk about something really ordinary just ordinary sand
i became interested in sand about years ago when i first saw sand from maui and in fact this is a little bit of sand from maui
so sand is about a tenth of a millimeter in size
each sand grain is about a tenth of a millimeter in size
but when you look closer at this look at whats there
its really quite amazing you have microshells there
you have things like coral
you have fragments of other shells you have olivine
you have bits of a volcano theres a little bit of a volcano there you have tube worms
an amazing array of incredible things exist in sand
and the reason that is is because in a place like this island a lot of the sand is made of biological material because the reefs provide a place where all these microscopic animals or macroscopic animals grow and when they die their shells and their teeth and their bones break up and they make grains of sand things like coral and so forth
so heres for example a picture of sand from maui
this is from lahaina and when were walking along a beach were actually walking along millions of years of biological and geological history
we dont realize it but its actually a record of that entire ecology
so here we see for example a sponge spicule two bits of coral here thats a sea urchin spine really some amazing stuff
so when i first looked at this i was i thought gee this is like a little treasure trove here
i couldnt believe it and id go around dissecting the little bits out and making photographs of them
heres what most of the sand in our world looks like
these are quartz crystals and feldspar so most sand in the world on the mainland is made of quartz crystal and feldspar its the erosion of granite rock
so mountains are built up and they erode away by water and rain and ice and so forth and they become grains of sand
theres some sand thats really much more colorful
these are sand from near the great lakes and you can see that its filled with minerals like pink garnet and green epidote all kinds of amazing stuff and if you look at different sands from different places every single beach every single place you look at sand its different heres from big sur like theyre little jewels
there are places in africa where they do the mining of jewels and you go to the sand where the rivers have the sand go down to the ocean and its like literally looking at tiny jewels through the microscope
so every grain of sand is unique every beach is different
every single grain is different there are no two grains of sand alike in the world
every grain of sand is coming somewhere and going somewhere
theyre like a snapshot in time
now sand is not only on earth but sand is ubiquitous throughout the universe in fact outer space is filled with sand and that sand comes together to make our planets and the moon
and you can see those in micrometeorites
this is some micrometeorites that the army gave me and they get these out of the drinking wells in the south pole
and theyre quite amazing looking and these are the tiny constituents that make up the world that we live in the planets and the moon
so nasa wanted me to take some pictures of moon sand so they sent me sand from all the different landings of the apollo missions that happened years ago
and i started taking pictures with my three dimensional microscopes
this was the first picture i took it was kind of amazing
i thought it looked kind of a little bit like the moon which is sort of interesting
now the way my microscopes work is normally in a microscope you can see very little at one time so what you have to do is you have to refocus the microscope keep taking pictures and then i have a computer program that puts all those pictures together into one picture so you can see actually what it looks like and i do that in so there you can see is a left eye view theres a right eye view
so sort of left eye view right eye view
now somethings interesting here this looks very different than any sand on earth that ive ever seen and ive seen a lot of sand on earth believe me
look at this hole in the middle that hole was caused by a micrometeorite hitting the moon
now the moon has no atmosphere so micrometeorites come in continuously and the whole surface of the moon is covered with powder now because for four billion years its been bombarded by micrometeorites and when micrometeorites come in at about to miles an hour they vaporize on contact
and you can see here that that is thats sort of vaporized and that material is holding this little clump of little sand grains together
this is a very small grain of sand this whole thing
and thats called a ring agglutinate
and many of the grains of sand on the moon look like that and youd never find that on earth
most of the sand on the moon especially and you know when you look at the moon theres the dark areas and the light areas the dark areas are lava flows theyre basaltic lava flows and thats what this sand looks like very similar to the sand that you would see in haleakala
other sands when these micrometeorites come in they vaporize and they make these fountains these microscopic fountains that go up into the i was going to say up into the air but there is no air goes sort of up and these microscopic glass beads are formed instantly and they harden and by the time they fall down back to the surface of the moon they have these beautiful colored glass spherules
and these are actually microscopic you need a microscope to see these
now heres a grain of sand that is from the moon and you can see that the entire crystal structure is still there
this grain of sand is probably about three and a half or four billion years old and its never eroded away like the way we have sand on earth erodes away because of water and tumbling air and so forth all you can see is a little bit of erosion down here by the sun has these solar storms and thats erosion by solar radiation
so what ive been trying to tell you today is things even as ordinary as a grain of sand can be truly extraordinary if you look closely and if you look from a different and a new point of view
i think that this was best put by william blake when he said to see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour
thank you

title edith widder the weird wonderful world of bioluminescence title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript in the deep dark ocean many sea creatures make their own light for hunting mating and self defense bioluminescence expert edith widder was one of the first to film this glimmering world at she brings some of her glowing friends onstage and shows more astonishing footage of glowing undersea life description
so i want to take you on a trip to an alien world
and its not a trip that requires light years of travel but its to a place where its defined by light
so its a little appreciated fact that most of the animals in our ocean make light
ive spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence
i study it because i think understanding it is critical to understanding life in the ocean where most bioluminescence occurs
i also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution
but mostly im entranced by it
since my my first dive in a deep diving submersible when i went down and turned out the lights and saw the fireworks displays ive been a bioluminescence junky
but i would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words and they were totally inadequate to the task
i needed some way to share the experience directly
and the first time i figured out that way was in this little single person submersible called deep rover
this next video clip youre going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence
and the first thing youre going to see is a transect screen that is about a meter across
narrator in front of the sub a mess screen will come into contact with the soft bodied creatures of the deep sea
with the subs lights switched off it is possible to see their bioluminescence the light produced when they collide with the mesh
this is the first time it has ever been recorded
edith widder so i recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully dark adapted human eye
which means that really is what you would see if you took a dive in a submersible
but just to try to prove that fact to you ive brought along some bioluminescent plankton in what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt at a live demonstration
so if we could have the lights down and have it as dark in here as possible i have a flask that has bioluminescent plankton in it
and youll note theres no light coming from them right now either because theyre dead or because i need to stir them up in some way for you to see what bioluminescence really looks like
oops sorry
i spend most of my time working in the dark im used to that
okay
so that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate a single celled alga
so why would a single celled alga need to be able to produce light
well it uses it to defend itself from its predators
the flash is like a scream for help
its whats known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and just like the alarm on your car or your house its meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder thereby either leading to his capture or scaring him away
theres a lot of animals that use this trick for example this black dragonfish
its got a light organ under its eye
its got a chin barbel
its got a lot of other light organs you cant see but youll see in here in a minute
so we had to chase this in the submersible for quite sometime because the top speed of this fish is one knot which was the top speed of the submersible
but it was worth it because we caught it in a special capture device brought it up into the lab on the ship and then everything on this fish lights up
its unbelievable
the light organs under the eyes are flashing
that chin barbel is flashing
its got light organs on its belly that are flashing fin lights
its a scream for help its meant to attract attention
its phenomenal
and you normally dont get to see this because weve exhausted the luminescence when we bring them up in nets
theres other ways you can defend yourself with light
for example this shrimp releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud
this blinds or distracts the predator
this little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this
now it may look like a tasty morsel or a pigs head with wings but if its attacked it puts out a barrage of light in fact a barrage of photon torpedoes
i just barely got the lights out in time for you to be able to see those gobs of light hitting the transect screen and then just glowing
its phenomenal
so theres a lot of animals in the open ocean most of them that make light
and we have a pretty good idea for most of them why
they use it for finding food for attracting mates for defending against predators
but when you get down to the bottom of the ocean thats where things get really strange
and some of these animals are probably inspiration for the things you saw in avatar but you dont have to travel to pandora to see them
theyre things like this
this is a golden coral a bush
it grows very slowly
in fact its thought that some of these are as much as years old which is one reason that bottom trawling should not be allowed
the other reason is this amazing bush glows
so if you brush up against it any place you brushed against it you get this twinkling blue green light thats just breathtaking
and you see things like this
this looks like something out of a dr seuss book just all manner of creatures all over this thing
and these are flytrap anemones
now if you poke it it pulls in its tentacles
but if you keep poking it it starts to produce light
and it actually ends up looking like a galaxy
it produces these strings of light presumably as some form of defense
there are starfish that can make light
and there are brittle stars that produce bands of light that dance along their arms
this looks like a plant but its actually an animal
and it anchors itself in the sand by blowing up a balloon on the end of its stock
so it can actually hold itself in very strong currents as you see here
but if we collect it very gently and we bring it up into the lab and just squeeze it at the base of the stock it produces this light that propagates from stem to the plume changing color as it goes from green to blue
colorization and sound effects added for you viewing pleasure
but we have no idea why it does that
heres another one this is also a sea pen
its got a brittle star hitching a ride
its a green saber of light
and like the one you just saw it can produce these as bands of light
so if i squeeze the base the bands go from base to tip
if i squeeze the tip they go from tip to base
so what do you think happens if you squeeze it in the middle
id be very interested in your theories about what thats about
so theres a language of light in the deep ocean and were just beginning to understand it and one way were going about that is were imitating a lot of these displays
this is an optical lure that ive used
we call it the electronic jellyfish
its just blue leds that we can program to do different types of displays
and we view it with a camera system i developed called eye in the sea that uses far red light thats invisible to most animals so its unobtrusive
so i just want to show you some of the responses weve elicited from animals in the deep sea
so the cameras black and white
its not high resolution
and what youre seeing here is a bait box with a bunch of like the cockroaches of the ocean there are isopods all over it
and right in the front is the electronic jellyfish
and when it starts flashing its just going to be one of the leds thats flashing very fast
but as soon as it starts to flash and its going to look big because it blooms on the camera i want you to look right here
theres something small there that responds
were talking to something
it looks like a little of string pearls basically in fact three strings of pearls
and this was very consistent
this was in the bahamas at about feet
we basically have a chat room going on here because once it gets started everybodys talking
and i think this is actually a shrimp thats releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water
but the cool thing is were talking to it
we dont know what were saying
personally i think its something sexy
and then finally i want to show you some responses that we recorded with the worlds first deep sea webcam which we had installed in monterey canyon last year
weve only just begun to analyze all of this data
this is going to be a glowing source first which is like bioluminescent bacteria
and it is an optical cue that theres carrion on the bottom of the ocean
so this scavenger comes in which is a giant sixgill shark
and i cant claim for sure that the optical source brought it in because theres bait right there
but if it had been following the odor plume it would have come in from the other direction
and it does actually seem to be trying to eat the electronic jellyfish
thats a foot long giant sixgill shark
okay so this next one is from the webcam and its going to be this pinwheel display
and this is a burglar alarm
and that was a humboldt squid a juvenile humboldt squid about three feet long
this is at feet in monterey canyon
but if its a burglar alarm you wouldnt expect it to attack the jellyfish directly
its supposed to be attacking whats attacking the jellyfish
but we did see a bunch of responses like this
this guy is a little more contemplative
hey wait a minute
theres supposed to be something else there
hes thinking about it
but hes persistent
he keeps coming back
and then he goes away for a few seconds to think about it some more and thinks maybe if i come in from a different angle
nope
so we are starting to get a handle on this but only just the beginnings
we need more eyes on the process
so if any of you ever get a chance to take a dive in a submersible by all means climb in and take the plunge
this is something that should be on everybodys bucket list because we live on an ocean planet
more than percent percent of the living space on our planet is ocean
its a magical place filled with breathtaking light shows and bizarre and wondrous creatures alien life forms that you dont have to travel to another planet to see
but if you do take the plunge please remember to turn out the lights
but i warn you its addictive
thank you

title nick bostrom a philosophical quest for our biggest problems title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript oxford philosopher and transhumanist nick bostrom examines the future of humankind and asks whether we might alter the fundamental nature of humanity to solve our most intrinsic problems description
i want to talk today about ive been asked to take the long view and im going to tell you what i think are the three biggest problems for humanity from this long point of view
some of these have already been touched upon by other speakers which is encouraging
it seems that theres not just one person who thinks that these problems are important
the first is death is a big problem
if you look at the statistics the odds are not very favorable to us
so far most people who have lived have also died
roughly percent of everybody who has been alive has died by now
so the annual death rate adds up to sorry the daily death rate people per day which is a huge number by any standard
the annual death rate then becomes million
if we just look at the single biggest cause of death aging it accounts for roughly two thirds of all human people who die
that adds up to an annual death toll of greater than the population of canada
sometimes we dont see a problem because either its too familiar or its too big
cant see it because its too big
i think death might be both too familiar and too big for most people to see it as a problem
once you think about it you see this is not statistical points these are lets see how far have i talked
ive talked for three minutes
so that would be roughly people have died since ive begun speaking
people like its roughly the population in this room has just died
now the human cost of that is obvious once you start to think about it the suffering the loss its also economically enormously wasteful
i just look at the information and knowledge and experience that is lost due to natural causes of death in general and aging in particular
suppose we approximated one person with one book
now of course this is an underestimation
a persons lifetime of learning and experience is a lot more than you could put into a single book
but lets suppose we did this
million people die of natural causes each year corresponds then to million volumes destroyed
library of congress holds million volumes
we are upset about the burning of the library of alexandria
its one of the great cultural tragedies that we remember even today
but this is the equivalent of three libraries of congress burnt down forever lost each year
so thats the first big problem
and i wish godspeed to aubrey de grey and other people like him to try to do something about this as soon as possible
existential risk the second big problem
existential risk is a threat to human survival or to the long term potential of our species
now why do i say that this is a big problem
well lets first look at the probability and this is very very difficult to estimate but there have been only four studies on this in recent years which is surprising
you would think that it would be of some interest to try to find out more about this given that the stakes are so big but its a very neglected area
but there have been four studies one by john lesley wrote a book on this
he estimated a probability that we will fail to survive the current century percent
similarly the astronomer royal whom we heard speak yesterday also has a percent probability estimate
another author doesnt give any numerical estimate but says the probability is significant that it will fail
i wrote a long paper on this
i said assigning a less than percent probability would be a mistake in light of the current evidence we have
now the exact figures here we should take with a big grain of salt but there seems to be a consensus that the risk is substantial
everybody who has looked at this and studied it agrees
now if we think about what just reducing the probability of human extinction by just one percentage point not very much so thats equivalent to million lives saved if we just count the currently living people the current generation
now one percent of six billion people is equivalent to million
so thats a large number
if we were to take into account future generations that will never come into existence if we blow ourselves up then the figure becomes astronomical
if we could eventually colonize a chunk of the universe the virgo supercluster maybe it will take us million years to get there but if we go extinct we never will
then even a one percentage point reduction in the extinction risk could be equivalent to this astronomical number to the power of
so if you take into account future generations as much as our own every other moral imperative of philanthropic cost just becomes irrelevant
the only thing you should focus on would be to reduce existential risk because even the tiniest decrease in existential risk would just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope to achieve
and even if you just look at the current people and ignore the potential that would be lost if we went extinct it should still have a high priority
now let me spend the rest of my time on the third big problem because its more subtle and perhaps difficult to grasp
think about some time in your life some people might never have experienced it but some people there are just those moments that you have experienced where life was fantastic
it might have been at the moment of some great creative inspiration you might have had when you just entered this flow stage
or when you understood something you had never done before
or perhaps in the ecstasy of romantic love
or an aesthetic experience a sunset or a great piece of art
every once in a while we have these moments and we realize just how good life can be when its at its best
and you wonder why cant it be like that all the time
you just want to cling onto this
and then of course it drifts back into ordinary life and the memory fades
and its really difficult to recall in a normal frame of mind just how good life can be at its best
or how bad it can be at its worst
the third big problem is that life isnt usually as wonderful as it could be
i think thats a big big problem
its easy to say what we dont want
here are a number of things that we dont want illness involuntary death unnecessary suffering cruelty stunted growth memory loss ignorance absence of creativity
suppose we fixed these things we did something about all of these
we were very successful
we got rid of all of these things
we might end up with something like this which is i mean its a heck of a lot better than that
but is this really the best we can dream of
is this the best we can do
or is it possible to find something a little bit more inspiring to work towards
and if we think about this i think its very clear that there are ways in which we could change things not just by eliminating negatives but adding positives
on my wish list at least would be much longer healthier lives greater subjective well being enhanced cognitive capacities more knowledge and understanding unlimited opportunity for personal growth beyond our current biological limits better relationships an unbounded potential for spiritual moral and intellectual development
if we want to achieve this what in the world would have to change
and this is the answer we would have to change
not just the world around us but we ourselves
not just the way we think about the world but the way we are our very biology
human nature would have to change
now when we think about changing human nature the first thing that comes to mind are these human modification technologies growth hormone therapy cosmetic surgery stimulants like ritalin adderall anti depressants anabolic steroids artificial hearts
its a pretty pathetic list
they do great things for a few people who suffer from some specific condition but for most people they dont really transform what it is to be human
and they also all seem a little bit most people have this instinct that well sure there needs to be anti depressants for the really depressed people
but theres a kind of queasiness that these are unnatural in some way
its worth recalling that there are a lot of other modification technologies and enhancement technologies that we use
we have skin enhancements clothing
as far as i can see all of you are users of this enhancement technology in this room so thats a great thing
mood modifiers have been used from time immemorial caffeine alcohol nicotine immune system enhancement vision enhancement anesthetics we take that very much for granted but just think about how great progress that is like having an operation before anesthetics was not fun
contraceptives cosmetics and brain reprogramming techniques that sounds ominous but the distinction between what is a technology a gadget would be the archetype and other ways of changing and rewriting human nature is quite subtle
so if you think about what it means to learn arithmetic or to learn to read youre actually literally rewriting your own brain
youre changing the microstructure of your brain as you go along
so in a broad sense we dont need to think about technology as only little gadgets like these things here but even institutions and techniques psychological methods and so forth
forms of organization can have a profound impact on human nature
looking ahead there is a range of technologies that are almost certain to be developed sooner or later
we are very ignorant about what the time scale for these things are but they all are consistent with everything we know about physical laws laws of chemistry etc
its possible to assume setting aside a possibility of catastrophe that sooner or later we will develop all of these
and even just a couple of these would be enough to transform the human condition
so lets look at some of the dimensions of human nature that seem to leave room for improvement
health span is a big and urgent thing because if youre not alive then all the other things will be to little avail
intellectual capacity lets take that box which falls into a lot of different sub categories memory concentration mental energy intelligence empathy
these are really great things
part of the reason why we value these traits is that they make us better at competing with other people theyre positional goods
but part of the reason and thats the reason why we have ethical ground for pursuing these is that theyre also intrinsically valuable
its just better to be able to understand more of the world around you and the people that you are communicating with and to remember what you have learned
modalities and special faculties
now the human mind is not a single unitary information processor but it has a lot of different special evolved modules that do specific things for us
if you think about what we normally take as giving life a lot of its meaning music humor eroticism spirituality aesthetics nurturing and caring gossip chatting with people all of these very likely are enabled by a special circuitry that we humans have but that you could have another intelligent life form that lacks these
were just lucky that we have the requisite neural machinery to process music and to appreciate it and enjoy it
all of these would enable in principle be amenable to enhancement
some people have a better musical ability and ability to appreciate music than others have
its also interesting to think about what other things are so if these all enabled great values why should we think that evolution has happened to provide us with all the modalities we would need to engage with other values that there might be
imagine a species that just didnt have this neural machinery for processing music
and they would just stare at us with bafflement when we spend time listening to a beautiful performance like the one we just heard because of people making stupid movements and they would be really irritated and wouldnt see what we were up to
but maybe they have another faculty something else that would seem equally irrational to us but they actually tap into some great possible value there
but we are just literally deaf to that kind of value
so we could think of adding on different new sensory capacities and mental faculties
bodily functionality and morphology and affective self control
greater subjective well being
be able to switch between relaxation and activity being able to go slow when you need to do that and to speed up
able to switch back and forth more easily would be a neat thing to be able to do easier to achieve the flow state when youre totally immersed in something you are doing
conscientiousness and sympathy
the ability to its another interesting application that would have large social ramification perhaps
if you could actually choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person undiminished through time so that wouldnt have to love would never have to fade if you didnt want it to
thats probably not all that difficult
it might just be a simple hormone or something that could do this
its been done in voles
you can engineer a prairie vole to become monogamous when its naturally polygamous
its just a single gene
might be more complicated in humans but perhaps not that much
this is the last picture that i want to now weve got to use the laser pointer
a possible mode of being here would be a way of life a way of being experiencing thinking seeing interacting with the world
down here in this little corner here we have the little sub space of this larger space that is accessible to human beings beings with our biological capacities
its a part of the space thats accessible to animals since we are animals we are a subset of that
and then you can imagine some enhancements of human capacities
there would be different modes of being you could experience if you were able to stay alive for say years
then you could live sorts of lives and accumulate wisdoms that are just not possible for humans as we currently are
so then you move off to this larger sphere of human and you could continue that process and eventually explore a lot of this larger space of possible modes of being
now why is that a good thing to do
well we know already that in this little human circle there there are these enormously wonderful and worthwhile modes of being human life at its best is wonderful
we have no reason to believe that within this much much larger space there would not also be extremely worthwhile modes of being perhaps ones that would be way beyond our wildest ability even to imagine or dream about
and so to fix this third problem i think we need slowly carefully with ethical wisdom and constraint develop the means that enable us to go out in this larger space and explore it and find the great values that might hide there
thanks

description ted talk subtitles and transcript south african singer songwriter vusi mahlasela dedicates his song thula mama to all women and especially his grandmother description
i d like to dedicate this one to all the women in south africa those women who refused to dwindle in the midst of apartheid
and of course i m dedicating it also to my grandmother whom i think really played quite a lot of important roles especially for me when i was an activist and being harassed by the police
you will recall that in june the students of south africa boycotted the language of afrikaans as the medium of the oppressor as they were sort of like really told that they must do everything in afrikaans biology mathematics and what about our languages
and the students wanted to speak to the government and police answered with bullets
so every year june we will commemorate all those comrades or students who died
and i was very young then i think i was years and i started asking questions and that s when my political education started
and i joined later on the youth organization under the african national congress
so as part of organizing this and whatever this commemoration the police will round us up as they call us leaders
and i used to run away from home when i know that maybe the police might be coming around the ninth or of june or so
and my grandmother one time said no look you re not going to run away
this is your place you stay here
and indeed the police came because they ll just arrest us and put us in jail and release us whenever they feel like after the or so
so it was on the of june and they came and they surrounded the house and my grandmother switched off all the lights in the house and opened the kitchen door
and she said to them vusis here and youre not going to take him tonight
im tired of you having to come here harassing us while your children are sleeping peacefully in your homes
he is here and youre not going to take him
ive got a bowl full of boiling water the first one who comes in here gets it

title gary lauders new traffic sign take turns title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript fifty percent of traffic accidents happen at intersections gary lauder shares a brilliant and cheap idea for helping drivers move along smoothly a new traffic sign that combines the properties of stop and yield description
i only have three minutes so im going to have to talk fast and it will use up your spare mental cycles so multitasking may be hard
so years ago i got a traffic ticket that got me thinking
ive had some time to think it over
and energy efficiency is more than just about the vehicle its also about the road
road design makes a difference particularly intersections of which there are two types signalized and unsignalized which means stop signs
fifty percent of crashes happen at intersections
roundabouts are much better
a study of intersections has found crashes drop percent from when you convert a traffic light into a roundabout
injury crashes have dropped percent fatal crashes down percent
but thats just safety
what about time and gas
so traffic keeps flowing so that means less braking which means less accelerating less gas and less pollution less time wasted and that partly accounts for europes better efficiency than we have in the united states
so unsignalized intersections meaning stop signs they save many lives but theres an excessive proliferation of them
small roundabouts are starting to appear
this is one in my neighborhood and they are much better better than traffic lights better than four way stop signs
theyre expensive to install but they are more expensive not to so we should look at that
but they are not applicable in all situations
so take for example the three way intersection
so its logical that youd have one there on the minor road entering the major
but the other two are somewhat questionable
so heres one theres another one which i studied
cars rarely appear on that third road
and so the question is what does that cost us
that intersection i looked at had about cars per day in each direction and so thats two ounces of gas to accelerate out of
thats five cents each and times cars per day thats per year
thats just the gasoline cost there is also pollution wear on the car and time
whats that time worth
well at seconds per cars thats hours per day the average wage in the u s
is an hour that is per year
add that together with the gas and its per year just for that sign in each direction
discount that back to the present at five percent over two million dollars for a stop sign in each direction
now if you look at what that adjacent property is worth you could actually buy the property cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line and then sell it off again
and youd still come out ahead
so it makes one wonder why is it there
i mean why is there that stop sign in each direction
because it is saving lives so is there a better way to accomplish that goal
the answer is to enable cars to come in from that side road safely
because there are a lot of people who might live up there and if theyre waiting forever a long queue could form because the cars arent slowing down on the main road
can that be accomplished with existing signs
so there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs
stop signs were invented in yield signs in but thats all we got
so why not use a yield sign
well the meaning of yield is you must yield the right of way
that means that if there are five cars waiting you have to wait till they all go then you go it lacks the notion of alternating or taking turns and its always on the minor road allowing the major one to have primacy
so its hard to create a new meaning for the existing sign
you couldnt suddenly tell everyone ok remember what you used to do at yield signs now do something different
that would not work
so what the world needs now is a new type of sign
so youd have a little instruction below it you know for those who didnt see the public service announcements
and it merges the stop sign and yield signs
its kind of shaped like a t as in taking turns
and uncertainty results in caution
when people come to an unfamiliar situation they dont know how to deal with they slow down
so now that you are all road scholars
dont wait for that sign to be adopted these things dont change quickly
but you all are members of communities and you can exercise your community influence to create more sensible traffic flows
and you can have more impact on the environment just getting your neighborhood to change these things than by changing your vehicle thank you very much

title paul rothemund dna folding in detail title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript in paul rothemund gave ted a short summary of his specialty dna folding now he lays out in clear abundant detail the immense promise of this field to create tiny machines that assemble themselves description
so people argue vigorously about the definition of life
they ask if it should have reproduction in it or metabolism or evolution
and i dont know the answer to that so im not going to tell you
i will say that life involves computation
so this is a computer program
booted up in a cell the program would execute and it could result in this person or with a small change it could result in this person or another small change this person or with a larger change this dog or this tree or this whale
so now if you take this metaphor genome as program seriously you have to consider that chris anderson is a computer fabricated artifact as is jim watson craig venter as are all of us
and in convincing yourself that this metaphor is true there are lots of similarities between genetic programs and computer programs that could help to convince you
but one to me thats most compelling is the peculiar sensitivity to small changes that can make large changes in biological development the output
a small mutation can take a two wing fly and make it a four wing fly
or it could take a fly and put legs where its antennae should be
or if youre familiar with the princess bride it could create a six fingered man
now a hallmark of computer programs is just this kind of sensitivity to small changes
if your bank accounts one dollar and you flip a single bit you could end up with a thousand dollars
so these small changes are things that i think that they indicate to us that a complicated computation in development is underlying these amplified large changes
so now all of this indicates that there are molecular programs underlying biology and it shows the power of molecular programs biology does
and what i want to do is write molecular programs potentially to build technology
and there are a lot of people doing this a lot of synthetic biologists doing this like craig venter
and they concentrate on using cells
theyre cell oriented
so my friends molecular programmers and i have a sort of biomolecule centric approach
were interested in using dna rna and protein and building new languages for building things from the bottom up using biomolecules potentially having nothing to do with biology
so these are all the machines in a cell
theres a camera
theres the solar panels of the cell some switches that turn your genes on and off the girders of the cell motors that move your muscles
my little group of molecular programmers are trying to refashion all of these parts from dna
were not dna zealots but dna is the cheapest easiest to understand and easy to program material to do this
and as other things become easier to use maybe protein well work with those
if we succeed what will molecular programming look like
youre going to sit in front of your computer
youre going to design something like a cell phone and in a high level language youll describe that cell phone
then youre going to have a compiler thats going to take that description and its going to turn it into actual molecules that can be sent to a synthesizer and that synthesizer will pack those molecules into a seed
and what happens if you water and feed that seed appropriately is it will do a developmental computation a molecular computation and itll build an electronic computer
and if i havent revealed my prejudices already i think that life has been about molecular computers building electrochemical computers building electronic computers which together with electrochemical computers will build new molecular computers which will build new electronic computers and so forth
and if you buy all of this and you think life is about computation as i do then you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist
so one big question is how does a baby know when to stop growing
and for molecular programming the question is how does your cell phone know when to stop growing
or how does a computer program know when to stop running
or more to the point how do you know if a program will ever stop
there are other questions like this too
one of them is craig venters question
turns out i think hes actually a computer scientist
he asked how big is the minimal genome that will give me a functioning microorganism
how few genes can i use
this is exactly analogous to the question whats the smallest program i can write that will act exactly like microsoft word
and just as hes writing you know bacteria that will be smaller hes writing genomes that will work we could write smaller programs that would do what microsoft word does
but for molecular programming our question is how many molecules do we need to put in that seed to get a cell phone
whats the smallest number we can get away with
now these are big questions in computer science
these are all complexity questions and computer science tells us that these are very hard questions
almost many of them are impossible
but for some tasks we can start to answer them
so im going to start asking those questions for the dna structures im going to talk about next
so this is normal dna what you think of as normal dna
its double stranded its a double helix has the as ts cs and gs that pair to hold the strands together
and im going to draw it like this sometimes just so i dont scare you
we want to look at individual strands and not think about the double helix
when we synthesize it it comes single stranded so we can take the blue strand in one tube and make an orange strand in the other tube and theyre floppy when theyre single stranded
you mix them together and they make a rigid double helix
now for the last years ned seeman and a bunch of his descendants have worked very hard and made beautiful three dimensional structures using this kind of reaction of dna strands coming together
but a lot of their approaches though elegant take a long time
they can take a couple of years or it can be difficult to design
so i came up with a new method a couple of years ago i call dna origami thats so easy you could do it at home in your kitchen and design the stuff on a laptop
but to do it you need a long single strand of dna which is technically very difficult to get
so you can go to a natural source
you can look in this computer fabricated artifact and hes got a double stranded genome thats no good
you look in his intestines there are billions of bacteria
theyre no good either
double strand again but inside them theyre infected with a virus that has a nice long single stranded genome that we can fold like a piece of paper
and heres how we do it
this is part of that genome
we add a bunch of short synthetic dnas that i call staples
each one has a left half that binds the long strand in one place and a right half that binds it in a different place and brings the long strand together like this
the net action of many of these on that long strand is to fold it into something like a rectangle
now we cant actually take a movie of this process but shawn douglas at harvard has made a nice visualization for us that begins with a long strand and has some short strands in it
and what happens is that we mix these strands together
we heat them up we add a little bit of salt we heat them up to almost boiling and cool them down and as we cool them down the short strands bind the long strands and start to form structure
and you can see a little bit of double helix forming there
when you look at dna origami you can see that what it really is even though you think its complicated is a bunch of double helices that are parallel to each other and theyre held together by places where short strands go along one helix and then jump to another one
so theres a strand that goes like this goes along one helix and binds it jumps to another helix and comes back
that holds the long strand like this
now to show that we could make any shape or pattern that we wanted i tried to make this shape
i wanted to fold dna into something that goes up over the eye down the nose up the nose around the forehead back down and end in a little loop like this
and so i thought if this could work anything could work
so i had the computer program design the short staples to do this
i ordered them they came by fedex
i mixed them up heated them cooled them down and i got billion little smiley faces floating around in a single drop of water
and each one of these is just one thousandth the width of a human hair ok
so theyre all floating around in solution and to look at them you have to get them on a surface where they stick
so you pour them out onto a surface and they start to stick to that surface and we take a picture using an atomic force microscope
its got a needle like a record needle that goes back and forth over the surface bumps up and down and feels the height of the first surface
it feels the dna origami
theres the atomic force microscope working and you can see that the landings a little rough
when you zoom in theyve got you know weak jaws that flip over their heads and some of their noses get punched out but its pretty good
you can zoom in and even see the extra little loop this little nano goatee
now whats great about this is anybody can do this
and so i got this in the mail about a year after i did this unsolicited
anyone know what this is what is it
its china right
so what happened is a graduate student in china lulu qian did a great job
she wrote all her own software to design and built this dna origami a beautiful rendition of china which even has taiwan and you can see its sort of on the worlds shortest leash right
so this works really well and you can make patterns as well as shapes ok
and you can make a map of the americas and spell dna with dna
and whats really neat about it well actually this all looks like nano artwork but it turns out that nano artwork is just what you need to make nano circuits
so you can put circuit components on the staples like a light bulb and a light switch
let the thing assemble and youll get some kind of a circuit
and then you can maybe wash the dna away and have the circuit left over
so this is what some colleagues of mine at caltech did
they took a dna origami organized some carbon nano tubes made a little switch you see here wired it up tested it and showed that it is indeed a switch
now this is just a single switch and you need half a billion for a computer so we have a long way to go
but this is very promising because the origami can organize parts just one tenth the size of those in a normal computer
so its very promising for making small computers
now i want to get back to that compiler
the dna origami is a proof that that compiler actually works
so you start with something in the computer
you get a high level description of the computer program a high level description of the origami
you can compile it to molecules send it to a synthesizer and it actually works
and it turns out that a company has made a nice program thats much better than my code which was kind of ugly and will allow us to do this in a nice visual computer aided design way
so now you can say all right why isnt dna origami the end of the story
you have your molecular compiler you can do whatever you want
the fact is that it does not scale
so if you want to build a human from dna origami the problem is you need a long strand thats trillion trillion bases long
thats three light years worth of dna so were not going to do this
were going to turn to another technology called algorithmic self assembly of tiles
it was started by erik winfree and what it does it has tiles that are a hundredth the size of a dna origami
you zoom in there are just four dna strands and they have little single stranded bits on them that can bind to other tiles if they match
and we like to draw these tiles as little squares
and if you look at their sticky ends these little dna bits you can see that they actually form a checkerboard pattern
so these tiles would make a complicated self assembling checkerboard
and the point of this if you didnt catch that is that tiles are a kind of molecular program and they can output patterns
and a really amazing part of this is that any computer program can be translated into one of these tile programs specifically counting
so you can come up with a set of tiles that when they come together form a little binary counter rather than a checkerboard
so you can read off binary numbers five six and seven
and in order to get these kinds of computations started right you need some kind of input a kind of seed
you can use dna origami for that
you can encode the number in the right hand side of a dna origami and when you add those tiles that count they will start to count they will read that and theyll stop at
so what weve done is weve figured out a way to have a molecular program know when to stop going
it knows when to stop growing because it can count
it knows how big it is
so that answers that sort of first question i was talking about
it doesnt tell us how babies do it however
so now we can use this counting to try and get at much bigger things than dna origami could otherwise
heres the dna origami and what we can do is we can write on both edges of the dna origami and we can now use our watering can and water with tiles and we can start growing tiles off of that and create a square
the counter serves as a template to fill in a square in the middle of this thing
so what weve done is weve succeeded in making something much bigger than a dna origami by combining dna origami with tiles
and the neat thing about it is is that its also reprogrammable
you can just change a couple of the dna strands in this binary representation and youll get rather than
and if you do that the origamis the same size but the resulting square that you get is three times bigger
so this sort of recapitulates what i was telling you about development
you have a very sensitive computer program where small changes single tiny little mutations can take something that made one size square and make something very much bigger
now this using counting to compute and build these kinds of things by this kind of developmental process is something that also has bearing on craig venters question
so you can ask how many dna strands are required to build a square of a given size
if we wanted to make a square of size or if we used dna origami alone we would require a number of dna strands thats the square of the size of that square so wed need or a million dna strands
thats really not affordable
but if we use a little computation we use origami plus some tiles that count then we can get away with using or dna strands
and so we can exponentially reduce the number of dna strands we use if we use counting if we use a little bit of computation
and so computation is some very powerful way to reduce the number of molecules you need to build something to reduce the size of the genome that youre building
and finally im going to get back to that sort of crazy idea about computers building computers
if you look at the square that you build with the origami and some counters growing off it the pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need to make a memory
so if you affix some wires and switches to those tiles rather than to the staple strands you affix them to the tiles then theyll self assemble the somewhat complicated circuits the demultiplexer circuits that you need to address this memory
so you can actually make a complicated circuit using a little bit of computation
its a molecular computer building an electronic computer
now you ask me how far have we gotten down this path
experimentally this is what weve done in the last year
here is a dna origami rectangle and here are some tiles growing from it
and you can see how they count
one two three four five six nine
so its got some errors but at least it counts up
so it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago and thats about the time constant for how long it takes to do these kinds of things so i think we made a lot of progress
weve got ideas about how to fix these errors
and i think in the next five or years well make the kind of squares that i described and maybe even get to some of those self assembled circuits
so now what do i want you to take away from this talk
i want you to remember that to create lifes very diverse and complex forms life uses computation to do that
and the computations that it uses theyre molecular computations and in order to understand this and get a better handle on it as feynman said you know we need to build something to understand it
and so we are going to use molecules and refashion this thing rebuild everything from the bottom up using dna in ways that nature never intended using dna origami and dna origami to seed this algorithmic self assembly
you know so this is all very cool but what id like you to take from the talk hopefully from some of those big questions is that this molecular programming isnt just about making gadgets
its not just making about its making self assembled cell phones and circuits
what its really about is taking computer science and looking at big questions in a new light asking new versions of those big questions and trying to understand how biology can make such amazing things thank you

title maira kalman the illustrated woman title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript author and illustrator maira kalman talks about her life and work from her covers for the new yorker to her books for children and grown ups she is as wonderful as wise and as deliciously off kilter in person as she is on paper description
what i am always thinking about is what this session is about which is called simplicity
and almost i would almost call it being simple minded but in the best sense of the word
im trying to figure out two very simple things how to live and how to die period
thats all im trying to do all day long
and im also trying to have some meals and have some snacks and you know and yell at my children and do all the normal things that keep you grounded
so i was fortunate enough to be born a very dreamy child
my older sister was busy torturing my parents and they were busy torturing her
i was lucky enough to be completely ignored which is a fabulous thing actually i want to tell you
so i was able to completely daydream my way through my life
and i finally daydreamed my way into nyu at a very good time in where i met a man who was trying to blow up the math building of nyu
and i was writing terrible poetry and knitting sweaters for him
and feminists hated us and the whole thing was wretched from beginning to end
but i kept writing bad poetry and he didnt blow up the math building but he went to cuba
but i gave him the money because i was from riverdale so i had more money than he did
and that was a good thing to help you know the cause
but then he came back and things happened and i decided i really hated my writing that it was awful awful purple prose
and i decided that i wanted to tell but i still wanted to tell a narrative story and i still wanted to tell my stories
so i decided that i would start to draw how hard could that be
and so what happened was that i started just becoming an editorial illustrator through you know sheer whatever sheer ignorance
and we started a studio
well tibor really started the studio called m amp co
and the premise of m amp co was we dont know anything but thats all right were going to do it anyway
and as a matter of fact its better not to know anything because if you know too much youre stymied
so the premise in the studio was there are no boundaries there is no fear
and i and my full time job i landed the best job on earth was to daydream and to actually come up with absurd ideas that fortunately there were enough people there and it was a team it was a collective it was not just me coming up with crazy ideas
but the point was that i was there as myself as a dreamer
and so some of the things i mean it was a long history of m amp co and clearly we also needed to make some money so we decided we would create a series of products
and some of the watches there attempting to be beautiful and humorous maybe not attempting hopefully succeeding
that to be able to talk about content to break apart what you normally expect to use humor and surprise elegance and humanity in your work was really important to us
it was a very high it was a very impersonal time in design and we wanted to say the content is whats important not the package not the wrapping
you really have to be journalists you have to be inventors you have to use your imagination more importantly than anything
so the good news is that i have a dog and though i dont know if i believe in luck i dont know what i believe in its a very complicated question but i do know that before i go away i crank his tail seven times
so whenever he sees a suitcase in the house because everybodys always you know leaving theyre always cranking this wonderful dogs tail and he runs to the other room
but i am able to make the transition from working for children and from working for adults to children and back and forth because you know i can say that im immature and in a way thats true
i dont really i mean i could tell you that i didnt understand im not proud of it but i didnt understand lets say percent of the talks at this conference
but i have been taking beautiful notes of drawings and i have a gorgeous onion from murray gell manns talk
and i have a beautiful page of doodles from jonathan woodhams talk
so good things come out of you know incomprehension which i will do a painting of and then it will end up in my work
so im open to the possibilities of not knowing and finding out something new
so in writing for children it seems simple and it is
you have to condense a story into pages usually
and what you have to do is you really have to edit down to what you want to say
and hopefully youre not talking down to kids and youre not talking in such a way that you you know couldnt stand reading it after one time
so i hopefully am writing you know books that are good for children and for adults
but the painting reflects i dont think differently for children than i do for adults
i try to use the same kind of imagination the same kind of whimsy the same kind of love of language
so you know and i have lots of wonderful looking friends
this is andrew gatz and he walked in through the door and i said you sit down there you know i take lots of photos
and the bertoia chair in the background is my favorite chair
so i get to put in all of the things that i love
hopefully a dialog between adults and children will happen on many different levels and hopefully different kinds of humor will evolve
and the books are really journals of my life
i never i dont like plots
i dont know what a plot means
i cant stand the idea of anything that starts in the beginning you know beginning middle and end it really scares me because my life is too random and too confused and i enjoy it that way
but anyway so we were in venice and this is our room and i had this dream that i was wearing this fantastic green gown and i was looking out the window and it was really a beautiful thing
and so i was able to put that into this story which is an alphabet and hopefully go on to something else
the letter c had other things in it
i was fortunate also to meet the man whos sitting on the bed though i gave him hair over here and he doesnt have hair
well he has some hair but well he used to have hair
and with him i was able to do a project that was really fantastic
i work for the new yorker and i do covers and happened and it was you know a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it
and rick and i were on our way to a party in the bronx and somebody said bronxistan and somebody said ferreristan and we came up with this new yorker cover which we were able to we didnt know what we were doing
we werent trying to be funny we werent trying to be well we were trying to be funny actually thats not true
we hoped wed be funny but we didnt know it would be a cover and we didnt know that that image at the moment that it happened would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people
and it really became the i dont know you know it was one of those moments people started laughing at what was going on
and from you know fattushis to taxistan to you know for the fashtoonks botoxia pashmina khlintunisia you know we were able to take the city and make fun of this completely foreign who are whats going on over here
who are these people what are these tribes
and david remnick who was really wonderful about it had one problem he didnt like al zheimers because he thought it would insult people with alzheimers
but you know we said david whos going to know
theyre not
so it stayed in and it was and you know it was a good thing
you know in the course of my life i never know whats going to happen and thats kind of the beauty part
and we were on cape cod a place obviously of great inspiration and i picked up this book the elements of style at a yard sale
and i didnt and id never used it in school because i was too busy writing poems and flunking out and i dont know what sitting in cafes
but i picked it up and i started reading it and i thought this book is amazing
i said people should know about this book
so i decided it needed a few it needed a lift it needed a few illustrations
and basically i called the you know i convinced the white estate and what an intersection of like you know polish jew you know main wasp family here i am saying id like to do something to this book
and they said yes and they left me completely alone which was a gorgeous wonderful thing
and i took the examples that they gave and just did paintings basically
so this is i dont know if you can read this
well susan this is a fine mess you are in
and when youre dealing with grammar which is you know incredibly dry e b white wrote such wonderful whimsical and actually strunk and then you come to the rules and you know there are lots of grammar things do you mind me asking a question
do you mind my asking a question
would could should or would should could
and would is coco chanels lover should is edith sitwell and could is an august sander subject
and he noticed a large stain in the center of the rug
so theres a kind of british understatement murder mystery theme that i really love very much
and then be obscure clearly be wild of tongue in a way we can understand
e b white wrote us a number of rules which can either paralyze you and make you loathe him for the rest of time or you can ignore them which i do or you can i dont know what you know eat a sandwich
so what i did when i was painting was i started singing because i really adore singing and i think that music is the highest form of all art
so i commissioned a wonderful composer nico muhly who wrote nine songs using the text and we performed this fantastic evening of he wrote music for both amateurs and professionals
i played the clattering teacup and the slinky in the main reading room of the new york public library where youre supposed to be very very quiet and it was a phenomenally wonderful event which we hopefully will do some more
who knows the new york timesselect the op ed page asked me to do a column and they said you can do whatever you want
so once a month for the last year ive been doing a column called the principles of uncertainty which you know i dont know who heisenberg is but i know i can throw that around now you know its the principles of uncertainty so you know
im going to read quickly and probably im going to edit some because i dont have that much time left a few of the columns
and basically i was so you know it was so amusing because i said well how much space do i have
and they said well you know its the internet
and i said yes but how much space do i have
and they said its unlimited its unlimited
ok so the first one i was very timid and ill begin
how can i tell you everything that is in my heart
impossible to begin enough no begin with the hapless dodo
and i talk about the dodo and how the dodo became extinct and then i talk about spinoza
as the last dodo was dying spinoza was looking for a rational explanation for everything called eudaemonia
and then he breathed his last with loved ones around him and i know that he had chicken soup also as his last meal
i happen to know it for a fact
and then he died and there was no more spinoza extinct
and then we dont have a stuffed spinoza but we do have a stuffed pavlovs dog and i visited him in the museum of hygiene in st petersburg in russia
and there he is with this horrible electrical box on his rump in this fantastic decrepit palace
and i think it must have been a very very dark day when the bolsheviks arrived
maybe amongst themselves they had a few good laughs but stalin was a paranoid man even more than my father
you dont even know
and decided his top people had to be extinctified
which i think i made up which is a good thing
and so this is a chart of you know just a small chart because the chart would go on forever of all the people that he killed
so shot dead smacked over the head you know thrown away
nabokovs family fled russia how could the young nabokov sitting innocently and elegantly in a red chair leafing through a book and butterflies imagine such displacement such loss
and then i want to tell you that this is a map
so my beautiful mothers family fled russia as well
too many pogroms
leaving the shack the wild blueberry woods the geese the river sluch they went to palestine and then america
and my mother drew this map for me of the united states of america and that is my dna over here because that person who i grew up with had no use for facts whatsoever
facts were actually banished from our home
and so if you see that texas you know texas and california are under canada and that south carolina is on top of north carolina this is the home that i grew up in ok
so its a miracle that im here today
but actually its not its actually a wonderful thing
but then she says tel aviv and lenin which is the town they came from and sorry the rest unknown thank you
but in her lexicon sorry the rest unknown thank you is sorry the rest unknown go to hell because she couldnt care less
the impossibility of february is that februarys a really wretched month in new york and the images for me conjure up these really awful things
well not so awful
i received a box in the mail and it was wrapped with newspaper and there was the picture of the man on the newspaper and he was dead
and i say i hope hes not really dead just enjoying a refreshing lie down in the snow but the caption says he is dead
and actually he was i think hes dead though i dont know maybe hes not dead
and this woman leans over in anguish not about that man but about all sad things it happens quite often in february
theres consoling
this man is angry because somebody threw onions all over the staircase and basically you know i guess onions are a theme here
and he says it is impossible not to lie
it is february and not lying is impossible
and i really spend a lot of time wondering how much truth do we tell
what is it that were actually what story are we actually telling
how do we know when we are ourselves
how do we actually know that these sentences coming out of our mouths are real stories you know are real sentences
or are they fake sentences that we think we ought to be saying
im going to quickly go through this
a quote by bertrand russell all the labor of all the ages all the devotion all the inspiration all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction
so now my friends if that is true and it is true what is the point
a complicated question
and so you know i talk to my friends and i go to plays where theyre singing russian songs
oh my god you know what
could we have no we dont have time
i taped my aunt i taped my aunt singing a song in russian from the you know could we have it for a second
do you have that
ok i taped my my aunt used to swim in the ocean every day of the year until she was about
so and thats a song about how everybodys miserable because you know were from russia
i went to visit kitty carlisle hart and she is and when i brought her a copy of the elements of style she said she would treasure it
and then i said oh and she was talking about moss hart and i said when you met him you knew it was him
and she said i knew it was he
so i was the one who should have kept the book but it was a really wonderful moment
and she dated george gershwin so you know get out
gershwin died at the age of
hes buried in the same cemetery as my husband
i dont want to talk about that now
i do want to talk the absolute icing on this cemetery cake is the barricini family mausoleum nearby
i think the barricini family should open a store there and sell chocolate
and i would like to run it for them
and i went to visit louise bourgeoise whos also still working and i looked at her sink which is really amazing and left
and then i photograph and do a painting of a sofa on the street
and a woman who lives on our street lolita
and then i go and have some tea
and then my aunt frances dies and before she died she tried to pay with sweetn low packets for her bagel
and i wonder what the point is and then i know and i see that hy meyerowitz rick meyerowitzs father a dry cleaning supply salesman from the bronx won the charlie chaplin look alike contest in
thats actually hy
and i look at a beautiful bowl of fruit and i look at a dress that i sewed for friends of mine
and it says ich habe genug which is a bach cantata which i once thought meant ive had it i cant take it anymore give me a break but i was wrong
it means i have enough and that is utterly true
i happen to be alive end of discussion thank you

title danny hillis the internet could crash we need a plan b title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript the internet connects billions of people and machines its the backbone of modern life but tech pioneer danny hillis thinks the internet just wasnt designed to grow this big and he fears that one big cyber attack or glitch could shut it down and take civilization with it to head off a digital dark age he sounds a clarion call to develop a plan b a parallel system to fall back on if or when the internet crashes description
so this book that i have in my hand is a directory of everybody who had an email address in
actually its deceptively large
theres actually only about people on each page because we have the name address and telephone number of every single person
and in fact everybodys listed twice because its sorted once by name and once by email address
obviously a very small community
there were only two other dannys on the internet then
i knew them both
we didnt all know each other but we all kind of trusted each other and that basic feeling of trust permeated the whole network and there was a real sense that we could depend on each other to do things
so just to give you an idea of the level of trust in this community let me tell you what it was like to register a domain name in the early days
now it just so happened that i got to register the third domain name on the internet
so i could have anything i wanted other than bbn com and symbolics com
so i picked think com but then i thought you know theres a lot of really interesting names out there
maybe i should register a few extras just in case
and then i thought nah that wouldnt be very nice
that attitude of only taking what you need was really what everybody had on the network in those days and in fact it wasnt just the people on the network but it was actually kind of built into the protocols of the internet itself
so the basic idea of i p or internet protocol and the way that the the routing algorithm that used it were fundamentally from each according to their ability to each according to their need
and so if you had some extra bandwidth youd deliver a message for someone
if they had some extra bandwidth they would deliver a message for you
youd kind of depend on people to do that and that was the building block
it was actually interesting that such a communist principle was the basis of a system developed during the cold war by the defense department but it obviously worked really well and we all saw what happened with the internet
it was incredibly successful
in fact it was so successful that theres no way that these days you could make a book like this
my rough calculation is it would be about miles thick
but of course you couldnt do it because we dont know the names of all the people with internet or email addresses and even if we did know their names im pretty sure that they would not want their name address and telephone number published to everyone
so the fact is that theres a lot of bad guys on the internet these days and so we dealt with that by making walled communities secure subnetworks vpns little things that arent really the internet but are made out of the same building blocks but were still basically building it out of those same building blocks with those same assumptions of trust
and that means that its vulnerable to certain kinds of mistakes that can happen or certain kinds of deliberate attacks but even the mistakes can be bad
so for instance in all of asia recently it was impossible to get youtube for a little while because pakistan made some mistakes in how it was censoring youtube in its internal network
they didnt intend to screw up asia but they did because of the way that the protocols work
another example that may have affected many of you in this audience is you may remember a couple of years ago all the planes west of the mississippi were grounded because a single routing card in salt lake city had a bug in it
now you dont really think that our airplane system depends on the internet and in some sense it doesnt
ill come back to that later
but the fact is that people couldnt take off because something was going wrong on the internet and the router card was down
and so there are many of those things that start to happen
now there was an interesting thing that happened last april
all of a sudden a very large percentage of the traffic on the whole internet including a lot of the traffic between u s military installations started getting re routed through china
so for a few hours it all passed through china
now china telecom says it was just an honest mistake and it is actually possible that it was the way things work but certainly somebody could make a dishonest mistake of that sort if they wanted to and it shows you how vulnerable the system is even to mistakes
imagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks
so if somebody really wanted to attack the united states or western civilization these days theyre not going to do it with tanks
that will not succeed
what theyll probably do is something very much like the attack that happened on the iranian nuclear facility
nobody has claimed credit for that
there was basically a factory of industrial machines
it didnt think of itself as being on the internet
it thought of itself as being disconnected from the internet but it was possible for somebody to smuggle a usb drive in there or something like that and software got in there that causes the centrifuges in that case to actually destroy themselves
now that same kind of software could destroy an oil refinery or a pharmaceutical factory or a semiconductor plant
and so theres a lot of im sure youve read a lot in papers about worries about cyberattacks and defenses against those
but the fact is people are mostly focused on defending the computers on the internet and theres been surprisingly little attention to defending the internet itself as a communications medium
and i think we probably do need to pay some more attention to that because its actually kind of fragile
so actually in the early days back when it was the arpanet there were actually times there was a particular time it failed completely because one single message processor actually got a bug in it
and the way the internet works is the routers are basically exchanging information about how they can get messages to places and this one processor because of a broken card decided it could actually get a message to some place in negative time
so in other words it claimed it could deliver a message before you sent it
so of course the fastest way to get a message anywhere was to send it to this guy who would send it back in time and get it there super early so every message in the internet started getting switched through this one node and of course that clogged everything up
everything started breaking
the interesting thing was though that the sysadmins were able to fix it but they had to basically turn every single thing on the internet off
now of course you couldnt do that today
i mean everything off its like the service call you get from the cable company except for the whole world
now in fact they couldnt do it for a lot of reasons today
one of the reasons is a lot of their telephones use ip protocol and use things like skype and so on that go through the internet right now and so in fact were becoming dependent on it for more and more different things like when you take off from lax youre really not thinking youre using the internet
when you pump gas you really dont think youre using the internet
whats happening increasingly though is these systems are beginning to use the internet
most of them arent based on the internet yet but theyre starting to use the internet for service functions for administrative functions and so if you take something like the cell phone system which is still relatively independent of the internet for the most part internet pieces are beginning to sneak into it in terms of some of the control and administrative functions and its so tempting to use these same building blocks because they work so well theyre cheap theyre repeated and so on
so all of our systems more and more are starting to use the same technology and starting to depend on this technology
and so even a modern rocket ship these days actually uses internet protocol to talk from one end of the rocket ship to the other
thats crazy it was never designed to do things like that
so weve built this system where we understand all the parts of it but were using it in a very very different way than we expected to use it and its gotten a very very different scale than it was designed for
and in fact nobody really exactly understands all the things its being used for right now
its turning into one of these big emergent systems like the financial system where weve designed all the parts but nobody really exactly understands how it operates and all the little details of it and what kinds of emergent behaviors it can have
and so if you hear an expert talking about the internet and saying it can do this or it does do this or it will do that you should treat it with the same skepticism that you might treat the comments of an economist about the economy or a weatherman about the weather or something like that
they have an informed opinion but its changing so quickly that even the experts dont know exactly whats going on
so if you see one of these maps of the internet its just somebodys guess
nobody really knows what the internet is right now because its different than it was an hour ago
its constantly changing its constantly reconfiguring
and the problem with it is i think we are setting ourselves up for a kind of disaster like the disaster we had in the financial system where we take a system thats basically built on trust was basically built for a smaller scale system and weve kind of expanded it way beyond the limits of how it was meant to operate
and so right now i think its literally true that we dont know what the consequences of an effective denial of service attack on the internet would be and whatever it would be is going to be worse next year and worse next year and so on
but so what we need is a plan b
there is no plan b right now
theres no clear backup system that weve very carefully kept to be independent of the internet made out of completely different sets of building blocks
so what we need is something that doesnt necessarily have to have the performance of the internet but the police department has to be able to call up the fire department even without the internet or the hospitals have to order fuel oil
this doesnt need to be a multi billion dollar government project
its actually relatively simple to do technically because it can use existing fibers that are in the ground existing wireless infrastructure
its basically a matter of deciding to do it
but people wont decide to do it until they recognize the need for it and thats the problem that we have right now
so theres been plenty of people plenty of us have been quietly arguing that we should have this independent system for years but its very hard to get people focused on plan b when plan a seems to be working so well
so i think that if people understand how much were starting to depend on the internet and how vulnerable it is we could get focused on just wanting this other system to exist and i think if enough people say yeah i would like to use it id like to have such a system then it will get built
its not that hard a problem
it could definitely be done by people in this room
and so i think that this is actually of all the problems youre going to hear about at the conference this is probably one of the very easiest to fix
so im happy to get a chance to tell you about it
thank you very much

title michael sandel why we shouldnt trust markets with our civic life title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript in the past three decades says michael sandel the us has drifted from a market economy to a market society its fair to say that an americans experience of shared civic life depends on how much money they have in a talk and audience discussion sandel asks us to think honestly on this question in our current democracy is too much for sale description
heres a question we need to rethink together what should be the role of money and markets in our societies
today there are very few things that money cant buy
if youre sentenced to a jail term in santa barbara california you should know that if you dont like the standard accommodations you can buy a prison cell upgrade
its true for how much do you think
what would you guess
five hundred dollars
its not the ritz carlton its a jail
eighty two dollars a night
eighty two dollars a night
if you go to an amusement park and dont want to stand in the long lines for the popular rides there is now a solution
in many theme parks you can pay extra to jump to the head of the line
they call them fast track or vip tickets
and this isnt only happening in amusement parks
in washington d c long lines queues sometimes form for important congressional hearings
now some people dont like to wait in long queues maybe overnight even in the rain
so now for lobbyists and others who are very keen to attend these hearings but dont like to wait there are companies line standing companies and you can go to them
you can pay them a certain amount of money they hire homeless people and others who need a job to stand waiting in the line for as long as it takes and the lobbyist just before the hearing begins can take his or her place at the head of the line and a seat in the front of the room
paid line standing
its happening the recourse to market mechanisms and market thinking and market solutions in bigger arenas
take the way we fight our wars
did you know that in iraq and afghanistan there were more private military contractors on the ground than there were u s military troops
now this isnt because we had a public debate about whether we wanted to outsource war to private companies but this is what has happened
over the past three decades we have lived through a quiet revolution
weve drifted almost without realizing it from having a market economy to becoming market societies
the difference is this a market economy is a tool a valuable and effective tool for organizing productive activity but a market society is a place where almost everything is up for sale
its a way of life in which market thinking and market values begin to dominate every aspect of life personal relations family life health education politics law civic life
now why worry why worry about our becoming market societies
for two reasons i think
one of them has to do with inequality
the more things money can buy the more affluence or the lack of it matters
if the only thing that money determined was access to yachts or fancy vacations or bmws then inequality wouldnt matter very much
but when money comes increasingly to govern access to the essentials of the good life decent health care access to the best education political voice and influence in campaigns when money comes to govern all of those things inequality matters a great deal
and so the marketization of everything sharpens the sting of inequality and its social and civic consequence
thats one reason to worry
theres a second reason apart from the worry about inequality and its this with some social goods and practices when market thinking and market values enter they may change the meaning of those practices and crowd out attitudes and norms worth caring about
id like to take an example of a controversial use of a market mechanism a cash incentive and see what you think about it
many schools struggle with the challenge of motivating kids especially kids from disadvantaged backgrounds to study hard to do well in school to apply themselves
some economists have proposed a market solution offer cash incentives to kids for getting good grades or high test scores or for reading books
theyve tried this actually
theyve done some experiments in some major american cities
in new york in chicago in washington d c theyve tried this offering dollars for an a dollars for a b
in dallas texas they have a program that offers eight year olds two dollars for each book they read
so lets see what some people are in favor some people are opposed to this cash incentive to motivate achievement
lets see what people here think about it
imagine that you are the head of a major school system and someone comes to you with this proposal
and lets say its a foundation they will provide the funds
you dont have to take it out of your budget
how many would be in favor and how many would be opposed to giving it a try
lets see by a show of hands
first how many think it might at least be worth a try to see if it would work raise your hand
and how many would be opposed how many would so the majority here are opposed but a sizable minority are in favor
lets have a discussion
lets start with those of you who object who would rule it out even before trying
what would be your reason
who will get our discussion started yes
heike moses hello everyone im heike and i think it just kills the intrinsic motivation so in the respect that children if they would like to read you just take this incentive away in just paying them so it just changes behavior
michael sandel takes the intrinsic incentive away
what is or should be the intrinsic motivation
hm well the intrinsic motivation should be to learn
ms to learn hm to get to know the world
and then if you stop paying them what happens then
then they stop reading
ms now lets see if theres someone who favors who thinks its worth trying this
elizabeth loftus im elizabeth loftus and you said worth a try so why not try it and do the experiment and measure things
ms and measure and what would you measure
youd measure how many el how many books they read and how many books they continued to read after you stopped paying them
ms oh after you stopped paying
all right what about that
hm to be frank i just think this is not to offend anyone a very american way
ms all right whats emerged from this discussion is the following question will the cash incentive drive out or corrupt or crowd out the higher motivation the intrinsic lesson that we hope to convey which is to learn to love to learn and to read for their own sakes
and people disagree about what the effect will be but that seems to be the question that somehow a market mechanism or a cash incentive teaches the wrong lesson and if it does what will become of these children later
i should tell you whats happened with these experiments
the cash for good grades has had very mixed results for the most part has not resulted in higher grades
the two dollars for each book did lead those kids to read more books
it also led them to read shorter books
but the real question is what will become of these kids later
will they have learned that reading is a chore a form of piecework to be done for pay thats the worry or may it lead them to read maybe for the wrong reason initially but then lead them to fall in love with reading for its own sake
now what this even this brief debate brings out is something that many economists overlook
economists often assume that markets are inert that they do not touch or taint the goods they exchange
market exchange they assume doesnt change the meaning or value of the goods being exchanged
this may be true enough if were talking about material goods
if you sell me a flat screen television or give me one as a gift it will be the same good
it will work the same either way
but the same may not be true if were talking about nonmaterial goods and social practices such as teaching and learning or engaging together in civic life
in those domains bringing market mechanisms and cash incentives may undermine or crowd out nonmarket values and attitudes worth caring about
once we see that markets and commerce when extended beyond the material domain can change the character of the goods themselves can change the meaning of the social practices as in the example of teaching and learning we have to ask where markets belong and where they dont where they may actually undermine values and attitudes worth caring about
but to have this debate we have to do something were not very good at and that is to reason together in public about the value and the meaning of the social practices we prize from our bodies to family life to personal relations to health to teaching and learning to civic life
now these are controversial questions and so we tend to shrink from them
in fact during the past three decades when market reasoning and market thinking have gathered force and gained prestige our public discourse during this time has become hollowed out empty of larger moral meaning
for fear of disagreement we shrink from these questions
but once we see that markets change the character of goods we have to debate among ourselves these bigger questions about how to value goods
one of the most corrosive effects of putting a price on everything is on commonality the sense that we are all in it together
against the background of rising inequality marketizing every aspect of life leads to a condition where those who are affluent and those who are of modest means increasingly live separate lives
we live and work and shop and play in different places
our children go to different schools
this isnt good for democracy nor is it a satisfying way to live even for those of us who can afford to buy our way to the head of the line
heres why
democracy does not require perfect equality but what it does require is that citizens share in a common life
what matters is that people of different social backgrounds and different walks of life encounter one another bump up against one another in the ordinary course of life because this is what teaches us to negotiate and to abide our differences
and this is how we come to care for the common good
and so in the end the question of markets is not mainly an economic question
its really a question of how we want to live together
do we want a society where everything is up for sale or are there certain moral and civic goods that markets do not honor and money cannot buy
thank you very much

title jeff hancock the future of lying title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript who hasn t sent a text message saying i m on my way when it wasn t true or fudged the truth a touch in their online dating profile but jeff hancock doesn t believe that the anonymity of the internet encourages dishonesty in fact he says the searchability and permanence of information online may even keep us honest description
let me tell you it has been a fantastic month for deception
and im not even talking about the american presidential race
we have a high profile journalist caught for plagiarism a young superstar writer whose book involves so many made up quotes that theyve pulled it from the shelves a new york times exposé on fake book reviews
its been fantastic
now of course not all deception hits the news
much of the deception is everyday in fact a lot of research shows that we all lie once or twice a day as dave suggested
so its about now suggests that most of us should have lied
lets take a look at winnipeg how many of you in the last hours think back have told a little fib or a big one how many have told a little lie out there
all right good these are all the liars
make sure you pay attention to them
no that looked good it was about two thirds of you
the other third didnt lie or perhaps forgot or youre lying to me about your lying which is very very devious this fits with a lot of the research which suggests that lying is very pervasive
its this pervasiveness combined with the centrality to what it means to be a human the fact that we can tell the truth or make something up that has fascinated people throughout history
here we have diogenes with his lantern
does anybody know what he was looking for
a single honest man and he died without finding one back in greece and we have confucius in the east who was really concerned with sincerity not only that you walked the walk or talked the talk but that you believed in what you were doing
you believed in your principles
now my first professional encounter with deception is a little bit later than these guys a couple thousand years
i was a customs officer for canada back in the mid
yeah i was defending canadas borders
you may think thats a weapon right there in fact thats a stamp i used a stamp to defend canadas borders
very canadian of me i learned a lot about deception while doing my duty here in customs one of which was that most of what i thought i knew about deception was wrong and ill tell you about some of that tonight
but even since just the way we communicate has been completely transformed we email we text we skype we facebook its insane
almost every aspect of human communications been changed and of course thats had an impact on deception
let me tell you a little bit about a couple of new deceptions weve been tracking and documenting
theyre called the butler the sock puppet and the chinese water army
it sounds a little bit like a weird book but actually theyre all new types of lies
lets start with the butlers heres an example of one on my way anybody ever written on my way
then youve also lied
were never on our way were thinking about going on our way
heres another one sorry i didnt respond to you earlier
my battery was dead your battery wasnt dead
you werent in a dead zone
you just didnt want to respond to that person that time
heres the last one youre talking to somebody and you say sorry got work gotta go
but really youre just bored you want to talk to somebody else
each of these is about a relationship and this is a connected world once you get my cell phone number you can literally be in touch with me hours a day
and so these lies are being used by people to create a buffer like the butler used to do between us and the connections to everybody else
but theyre very special they use ambiguity that comes from using technology you dont know where i am or what im doing or who im with
and theyre aimed at protecting the relationships
these arent just people being jerks these are people that are saying look i dont want to talk to you now or i didnt want to talk to you then but i still care about you
our relationship is still important
now the sock puppet on the other hand is a totally different animal the sock puppet isnt about ambiguity per se its about identity
let me give you a very recent example as in like last week
heres r j ellory best seller author in britain
heres one of his bestselling books
heres a reviewer online on amazon
my favorite by nicodemus jones is whatever else it might do it will touch your soul
and of course you might suspect that nicodemus jones is r j ellory
he wrote very very positive reviews about himself surprise surprise
now this sock puppet stuff isnt actually that new
walt whitman also did this back in the day before there was internet technology sock puppet becomes interesting when we get to scale which is the domain of the chinese water army
chinese water army refers to thousands of people in china that are paid small amounts of money to produce content it could be reviews it could be propaganda the government hires these people companies hire them all over the place
in north america we call this astroturfing and astroturfing is very common now theres a lot of concerns about it
we see this especially with product reviews book reviews everything from hotels to whether that toaster is a good toaster or not
now looking at these three reviews or these three types of deception you might think wow the internet is really making us a deceptive species especially when you think about the astroturfing where we can see deception brought up to scale
but actually what ive been finding is very different from that
now lets put aside the online anonymous sex chatrooms which im sure none of you have been in
i can assure you theres deception there
and lets put aside the nigerian prince whos emailed you about getting the million out of the country
lets forget about that guy too
lets focus on the conversations between our friends and our family and our coworkers and our loved ones
those are the conversations that really matter
what does technology do to deception with those folks
heres a couple of studies one of the studies we do are called diary studies in which we ask people to record all of their conversations and all of their lies for seven days and what we can do then is calculate how many lies took place per conversation within a medium and the finding that we get that surprises people the most is that email is the most honest of those three media
and it really throws people for a loop because we think well theres no nonverbal cues so why dont you lie more
the phone in contrast the most lies
again and again and again we see the phone is the device that people lie on the most and perhaps because of the butler lie ambiguities i was telling you about
this tends to be very different from what people expect
what about résumés we did a study in which we had people apply for a job and they could apply for a job either with a traditional paper résumé or on linkedin which is a social networking site like facebook but for professionals involves the same information as a résumé
and what we found to many peoples surprise was that those linkedin résumés were more honest on the things that mattered to employers like your responsibilities or your skills at your previous job
how about facebook itself
you know we always think that hey there are these idealized versions people are just showing the best things that happened in their lives ive thought that many times
my friends no way they can be that cool and have good of a life
well one study tested this by examining peoples personalities
they had four good friends of a person judge their personality
then they had strangers many strangers judge the persons personality just from facebook and what they found was those judgments of the personality were pretty much identical highly correlated meaning that facebook profiles really do reflect our actual personality
all right well what about online dating
i mean thats a pretty deceptive space
im sure you all have friends that have used online dating
and they would tell you about that guy that had no hair when he came or the woman that didnt look at all like her photo
well we were really interested in it and so what we did is we brought people online daters into the lab and then we measured them we got their height up against the wall we put them on a scale got their weight ladies loved that and then we actually got their drivers license to get their age
and what we found was very very interesting
heres an example of the men and the height
along the bottom is how tall they said they were in their profile
along the y axis the vertical axis is how tall they actually were
that diagonal line is the truth line if their dots on it they were telling exactly the truth
now as you see most of the little dots are below the line
what it means is all the guys were lying about their height
in fact they lied about their height about nine tenths of an inch what we say in the lab as strong rounding up
you get to and one tenth and boom
but whats really important here is look at all those dots
they are clustering pretty close to the truth what we found was percent of our participants did indeed lie on one of those dimensions but they always lied by a little bit
one of the reasons is pretty simple if you go to a date a coffee date and youre completely different than what you said game over right so people lied frequently but they lied subtly not too much they were constrained
well what explains all these studies what explains the fact that despite our intuitions mine included a lot of online communication technologically mediated communication is more honest than face to face
that really is strange how do we explain this
well to do that one thing is we can look at the deception detection literature
its a very old literature by now its coming up on years
its been reviewed many times theres been thousands of trials hundreds of studies and theres some really compelling findings
the first is were really bad at detecting deception really bad fifty four percent accuracy on average when you have to tell if somebody that just said a statement is lying or not
thats really bad why is it so bad
well it has to do with pinocchios nose
if i were to ask you guys what do you rely on when youre looking at somebody and you want to find out if theyre lying what cue do you pay attention to
most of you would say that one of the cues you look at is the eyes the eyes are the window to the soul
and youre not alone around the world almost every culture one of the top cues is eyes but the research over the last years says theres actually no reliable cue to deception which blew me away and its one of the hard lessons that i learned when i was customs officer
the eyes do not tell us whether somebodys lying or not
some situations yes high stakes maybe their pupils dilate their pitch goes up their body movements change a little bit but not all the time not for everybody its not reliable
strange the other thing is that just because you cant see me doesnt mean im going to lie its common sense but one important finding is that we lie for a reason
we lie to protect ourselves or for our own gain or for somebody elses gain
so there are some pathological liars but they make up a tiny portion of the population we lie for a reason
just because people cant see us doesnt mean were going to necessarily lie
but i think theres actually something much more interesting and fundamental going on here the next big thing for me the next big idea we can find by going way back in history to the origins of language
most linguists agree that we started speaking somewhere between and years ago thats a long time ago
a lot of humans have lived since then
weve been talking i guess about fires and caves and saber toothed tigers i dont know what they talked about but they were doing a lot of talking and like i said theres a lot of humans evolving speaking about billion people in fact
whats important though is that writing only emerged about years ago so what that means is that all the people before there was any writing every word that they ever said every utterance disappeared no trace evanescent gone
so weve been evolving to talk in a way in which there is no record in fact even the next big change to writing was only years ago now with the printing press which is very recent in our past and literacy rates remained incredibly low right up until world war ii so even the people of the last two millennia most of the words they ever said poof disappeared
lets turn to now the networked age
how many of you have recorded something today
anybody do any writing today did anybody write a word
it looks like almost every single person here recorded something
in this room right now weve probably recorded more than almost all of human pre ancient history
that is crazy were entering this amazing period of flux in human evolution where weve evolved to speak in a way in which our words disappear but were in an environment where were recording everything
in fact i think in the very near future its not just what we write that will be recorded everything we do will be recorded
what does that mean whats the next big idea from that
well as a social scientist this is the most amazing thing i have ever even dreamed of now i can look at all those words that used to for millennia disappear
i can look at lies that before were said and then gone
you remember those astroturfing reviews that we were talking about before well when they write a fake review they have to post it somewhere and its left behind for us
so one thing that we did and ill give you an example of looking at the language is we paid people to write some fake reviews one of these reviews is fake
the person never was at the james hotel
the other review is real the person stayed there
now your task now is to decide which review is fake
ill give you a moment to read through them
but i want everybody to raise their hand at some point
remember i study deception i can tell if you dont raise your hand
all right how many of you believe that a is the fake
all right very good about half
and how many of you think that b is
all right slightly more for b
excellent heres the answer
b is a fake well done second group you dominated the first group
youre actually a little bit unusual every time we demonstrate this its usually about a split which fits with the research percent maybe people here in winnipeg are more suspicious and better at figuring it out
those cold hard winters i love it
all right so why do i care about this
well what i can do now with my colleagues in computer science is we can create computer algorithms that can analyze the linguistic traces of deception
let me highlight a couple of things here in the fake review the first is that liars tend to think about narrative they make up a story who and what happened and thats what happened here
our fake reviewers talked about who they were with and what they were doing they also used the first person singular i way more than the people that actually stayed there
they were inserting themselves into the hotel review kind of trying to convince you they were there
in contrast the people that wrote the reviews that were actually there their bodies actually entered the physical space they talked a lot more about spatial information
they said how big the bathroom was or they said you know heres how far shopping is from the hotel
now you guys did pretty well most people perform at chance at this task
our computer algorithm is very accurate much more accurate than humans can be and its not going to be accurate all the time
this isnt a deception detection machine to tell if your girlfriends lying to you on text messaging
we believe that every lie now every type of lie fake hotel reviews fake shoe reviews your girlfriend cheating on you with text messaging those are all different lies theyre going to have different patterns of language but because everythings recorded now we can look at all of those kinds of lies
now as i said as a social scientist this is wonderful
its transformational were going to be able to learn so much more about human thought and expression about everything from love to attitudes because everything is being recorded now but what does it mean for the average citizen
what does it mean for us in our lives
well lets forget deception for a bit one of the big ideas i believe is that were leaving these huge traces behind
my outbox for email is massive and i never look at it i write all the time but i never look at my record at my trace
and i think were going to see a lot more of that where we can reflect on who we are by looking at what we wrote what we said what we did
now if we bring it back to deception theres a couple of take away things here
first lying online can be very dangerous right
not only are you leaving a record for yourself on your machine but youre leaving a record on the person that you were lying to and youre also leaving them around for me to analyze with some computer algorithms
so by all means go ahead and do that thats good
but when it comes to lying and what we want to do with our lives i think we can go back to diogenes and confucius and they were less concerned about whether to lie or not to lie and more concerned about being true to the self and i think this is really important
now when you are about to say or do something we can think do i want this to be part of my legacy part of my personal record
because in the digital age we live in now in the networked age we are all leaving a record
thank you so much for your time and good luck with your record

title stefan larsson what doctors can learn from each other title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript different hospitals produce different results on different procedures only patients don t know that data making choosing a surgeon a high stakes guessing game stefan larsson looks at what happens when doctors measure and share their outcomes on hip replacement surgery for example to see which techniques are proving the most effective could health care get better and cheaper if doctors learn from each other in a continuous feedback loop description
five years ago i was on a sabbatical and i returned to the medical university where i studied
i saw real patients and i wore the white coat for the first time in years in fact since i became a management consultant
there were two things that surprised me during the month i spent
the first one was that the common theme of the discussions we had were hospital budgets and cost cutting and the second thing which really bothered me actually was that several of the colleagues i met former friends from medical school who i knew to be some of the smartest most motivated engaged and passionate people id ever met many of them had turned cynical disengaged or had distanced themselves from hospital management
so with this focus on cost cutting i asked myself are we forgetting the patient
many countries that you represent and where i come from struggle with the cost of healthcare
its a big part of the national budgets
and many different reforms aim at holding back this growth
in some countries we have long waiting times for patients for surgery
in other countries new drugs are not being reimbursed and therefore dont reach patients
in several countries doctors and nurses are the targets to some extent for the governments
after all the costly decisions in health care are taken by doctors and nurses
you choose an expensive lab test you choose to operate on an old and frail patient
so by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians this is a way to hold costs down
and ultimately some physicians will say today that they dont have the full liberty to make the choices they think are right for their patients
so no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated
at bcg we looked at this and we asked ourselves this cant be the right way of managing healthcare
and so we took a step back and we said what is it that we are trying to achieve
ultimately in the healthcare system were aiming at improving health for the patients and we need to do so at a limited or affordable cost
we call this value based healthcare
on the screen behind me you see what we mean by value outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend
this was described beautifully in a book in by michael porter and elizabeth teisberg
on this picture you have my father in law surrounded by his three beautiful daughters
when we started doing our research at bcg we decided not to look so much at the costs but to look at the quality instead and in the research one of the things that fascinated us was the variation we saw
you compare hospitals in a country youll find some that are extremely good but youll find a large number that are vastly much worse
the differences were dramatic
erik my father in law he suffers from prostate cancer and he probably needs surgery
now living in europe he can choose to go to germany that has a well reputed healthcare system
if he goes there and goes to the average hospital he will have the risk of becoming incontinent by about percent so he would have to start wearing diapers again
you flip a coin fifty percent risk thats quite a lot
if he instead would go to hamburg and to a clinic called the martini klinik the risk would be only one in
either you a flip a coin or you have a one in risk
thats a huge difference a seven fold difference
when we look at many hospitals for many different diseases we see these huge differences
but you and i dont know we dont have the data
and often the data actually doesnt exist
nobody knows
so going the hospital is a lottery
now it doesnt have to be that way there is hope
in the late there were a group of swedish orthopedic surgeons who met at their annual meeting and they were discussing the different procedures they used to operate hip surgery
to the left of this slide you see a variety of metal pieces artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip
they all realized they had their individual way of operating
they all argued that my technique is the best but none of them actually knew and they admitted that
so they said we probably need to measure quality so we know and can learn from whats best
so they in fact spent two years debating so what is quality in hip surgery
oh we should measure this no we should measure that
and they finally agreed
and once they had agreed they started measuring and started sharing the data
very quickly they found that if you put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal shaft in it actually lasted a lot longer and most patients would never have to be re operated on in their lifetime
they published the data and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country
everybody saw this makes a lot of sense
since then they publish every year
once a year they publish the league table whos best whos at the bottom
and they visit each other to try to learn so a continuous cycle of improvement
for many years swedish hip surgeons had the best results in the world at least for those who actually were measuring and many were not
now i found this principle really exciting
so the physicians get together they agree on what quality is they start measuring they share the data they find whos best and they learn from it
continuous improvement
now thats not the only exciting part
thats exciting in itself
but if you bring back the cost side of the equation and look at that it turns out those who have focused on quality they actually also have the lowest costs although thats not been the purpose in the first place
so if you look at the hip surgery story again there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the u s and sweden
they looked at how many patients have needed to be re operated on seven years after the first surgery
in the united states the number was three times higher than in sweden
so many unnecessary surgeries and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year period
now you can imagine how much savings there would be for society
we did a study where we looked at oecd data
oecd does every so often look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries
the united states has for many diseases actually a quality which is below the average in oecd
now if the american healthcare system would focus a lot more on measuring quality and raise quality just to the level of average oecd it would save the american people billion u s dollars a year
thats percent of the budget of the healthcare budget of the country
now you may say that these numbers are fantastic and its all logical but is it possible
this would be a paradigm shift in healthcare and i would argue that not only can it be done but it has to be done
the agents of change are the doctors and nurses in the healthcare system
in my practice as a consultant i meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare staff every year
the one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients
physicians are like most of you in the audience very competitive
they were always best in class
we were always best in class
and if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no better than what others do they will do whatever it takes to improve
but most of them dont know
but physicians have another characteristic
they actually thrive from peer recognition
if a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discusses why that other hospital has so much better results they will share
they will share the information on how to improve
so it is by measuring and creating transparency you get a cycle of continuous improvement which is what this slide shows
now you may say this is a nice idea but this isnt only an idea
this is happening in reality
were creating a global community and a large global community where well be able to measure and compare what we achieve
together with two academic institutions michael porter at harvard business school and the karolinska institute in sweden bcg has formed something we call ichom
you may think thats a sneeze but its not a sneeze its an acronym
it stands for the international consortium for health outcome measurement
were bringing together leading physicians and patients to discuss disease by disease what is really quality what should we measure and to make those standards global
theyve worked four working groups have worked during the past year cataracts back pain coronary artery disease which is for instance heart attack and prostate cancer
the four groups will publish their data in november of this year
thats the first time well be comparing apples to apples not only within a country but between countries
next year were planning to do eight diseases the year after
in three years time we plan to have covered percent of the disease burden
compare apples to apples whos better
why is that
five months ago i led a workshop at the largest university hospital in northern europe
they have a new ceo and she has a vision i want to manage my big institution much more on quality outcomes that matter to patients
this particular day we sat in a workshop together with physicians nurses and other staff discussing leukemia in children
the group discussed how do we measure quality today
can we measure it better than we do
we discussed how do we treat these kids what are important improvements
and we discussed what are the costs for these patients can we do treatment more efficiently
there was an enormous energy in the room
there were so many ideas so much enthusiasm
at the end of the meeting the chairman of the department he stood up
he looked over the group and he said first he raised his hand i forgot that he raised his hand clenched his fist and then he said to the group thank you
thank you today were finally discussing what this hospital does the right way
by measuring value in healthcare that is not only costs but outcomes that matter to patients we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but an important part of the solution
i believe measuring value in healthcare will bring about a revolution and im convinced that the founder of modern medicine the greek hippocrates who always put the patient at the center he would smile in his grave
thank you

title brian cox why we need the explorers title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript in tough economic times our exploratory science programs from space probes to the lhc are first to suffer budget cuts brian cox explains how curiosity driven science pays for itself powering innovation and a profound appreciation of our existence description
we live in difficult and challenging economic times of course
and one of the first victims of difficult economic times i think is public spending of any kind but certainly in the firing line at the moment is public spending for science and particularly curiosity led science and exploration
so i want to try and convince you in about minutes that thats a ridiculous and ludicrous thing to do
but i think to set the scene i want to show the next slide is not my attempt to show the worst ted slide in the history of ted but it is a bit of a mess
but actually its not my fault its from the guardian newspaper
and its actually a beautiful demonstration of how much science costs
because if im going to make the case for continuing to spend on curiosity driven science and exploration i should tell you how much it costs
so this is a game called spot the science budgets
this is the u k government spend
you see there its about billion a year
the science budget is actually if you look to your left theres a purple set of blobs and then yellow set of blobs
and its one of the yellow set of blobs around the big yellow blob
its about billion pounds per year out of billion
that funds everything in the u k
from medical research space exploration where i work at cern in geneva particle physics engineering even arts and humanities funded from the science budget which is that billion that little tiny yellow blob around the orange blob at the top left of the screen
so thats what were arguing about
that percentage by the way is about the same in the u s and germany and france
r amp d in total in the economy publicly funded is about percent of gdp
so thats what were arguing about
the first thing i want to say and this is straight from wonders of the solar system is that our exploration of the solar system and the universe has shown us that it is indescribably beautiful
this is a picture that actually was sent back by the cassini space probe around saturn after wed finished filming wonders of the solar system
so it isnt in the series
its of the moon enceladus
so that big sweeping white sphere in the corner is saturn which is actually in the background of the picture
and that crescent there is the moon enceladus which is about as big as the british isles
its about kilometers in diameter
so tiny moon
whats fascinating and beautiful
this an unprocessed picture by the way i should say its black and white straight from saturnian orbit
whats beautiful is you can probably see on the limb there some faint sort of wisps of almost smoke rising up from the limb
this is how we visualize that in wonders of the solar system
its a beautiful graphic
what we found out were that those faint wisps are actually fountains of ice rising up from the surface of this tiny moon
thats fascinating and beautiful in itself but we think that the mechanism for powering those fountains requires there to be lakes of liquid water beneath the surface of this moon
and whats important about that is that on our planet on earth wherever we find liquid water we find life
so to find strong evidence of liquid pools of liquid beneath the surface of a moon million miles away from the earth is really quite astounding
so what were saying essentially is maybe thats a habitat for life in the solar system
well let me just say that was a graphic i just want to show this picture
thats one more picture of enceladus
this is when cassini flew beneath enceladus
so it made a very low pass just a few hundred kilometers above the surface
and so this again a real picture of the ice fountains rising up into space absolutely beautiful
but thats not the prime candidate for life in the solar system
thats probably this place which is a moon of jupiter europa
and again we had to fly to the jovian system to get any sense that this moon as most moons was anything other than a dead ball of rock
its actually an ice moon
so what youre looking at is the surface of the moon europa which is a thick sheet of ice probably a hundred kilometers thick
but by measuring the way that europa interacts with the magnetic field of jupiter and looking at how those cracks in the ice that you can see there on that graphic move around weve inferred very strongly that theres an ocean of liquid surrounding the entire surface of europa
so below the ice theres an ocean of liquid around the whole moon
it could be hundreds of kilometers deep we think
we think its saltwater and that would mean that theres more water on that moon of jupiter than there is in all the oceans of the earth combined
so that place a little moon around jupiter is probably the prime candidate for finding life on a moon or a body outside the earth that we know of
tremendous and beautiful discovery
our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful
it may also have pointed the way to answering one of the most profound questions that you can possibly ask which is are we alone in the universe
is there any other use to exploration and science other than just a sense of wonder
well there is
this is a very famous picture taken actually on my first christmas eve december when i was about eight months old
it was taken by apollo as it went around the back of the moon
earthrise from apollo
a famous picture many people have said that its the picture that saved which was a turbulent year the student riots in paris the height of the vietnam war
the reason many people think that about this picture and al gore has said it many times actually on the stage at ted is that this picture arguably was the beginning of the environmental movement
because for the first time we saw our world not as a solid immovable but as a very small fragile looking world just hanging against the blackness of space
whats also not often said about the space exploration about the apollo program is the economic contribution it made
i mean while you can make arguments that it was wonderful and a tremendous achievement and delivered pictures like this it cost a lot didnt it
well actually many studies have been done about the economic effectiveness the economic impact of apollo
the biggest one was in by chase econometrics
and it showed that for every spent on apollo came back into the u s economy
so the apollo program paid for itself in inspiration in engineering achievement and i think in inspiring young scientists and engineers times over
so exploration can pay for itself
what about scientific discovery
what about driving innovation
well this looks like a picture of virtually nothing
what it is is a picture of the spectrum of hydrogen
see back in the many scientists many observers looked at the light given off from atoms
and they saw strange pictures like this
what youre seeing when you put it through a prism is that you heat hydrogen up and it doesnt just glow like a white light it just emits light at particular colors a red one a light blue one some dark blue ones
now that led to an understanding of atomic structure because the way thats explained is atoms are a single nucleus with electrons going around them
and the electrons can only be in particular places
and when they jump up to the next place they can be and fall back down again they emit light at particular colors
and so the fact that atoms when you heat them up only emit light at very specific colors was one of the key drivers that led to the development of the quantum theory the theory of the structure of atoms
i just wanted to show this picture because this is remarkable
this is actually a picture of the spectrum of the sun
and now this is a picture of atoms in the suns atmosphere absorbing light
and again they only absorb light at particular colors when electrons jump up and fall down jump up and fall down
but look at the number of black lines in that spectrum
and the element helium was discovered just by staring at the light from the sun because some of those black lines were found that corresponded to no known element
and thats why heliums called helium
its called helios helios from the sun
now that sounds esoteric and indeed it was an esoteric pursuit but the quantum theory quickly led to an understanding of the behaviors of electrons in materials like silicon for example
the way that silicon behaves the fact that you can build transistors is a purely quantum phenomenon
so without that curiosity driven understanding of the structure of atoms which led to this rather esoteric theory quantum mechanics then we wouldnt have transistors we wouldnt have silicon chips we wouldnt have pretty much the basis of our modern economy
theres one more i think wonderful twist to that tale
in wonders of the solar system we kept emphasizing the laws of physics are universal
its one of the most incredible things about the physics and the understanding of nature that you get on earth is you can transport it not only to the planets but to the most distant stars and galaxies
and one of the astonishing predictions of quantum mechanics just by looking at the structure of atoms the same theory that describes transistors is that there can be no stars in the universe that have reached the end of their life that are bigger than quite specifically times the mass of the sun
thats a limit imposed on the mass of stars
you can work it out on a piece of paper in a laboratory get a telescope swing it to the sky and you find that there are no dead stars bigger than times the mass of the sun
thats quite an incredible prediction
what happens when you have a star thats right on the edge of that mass
well this is a picture of it
this is the picture of a galaxy a common our garden galaxy with what billion stars like our sun in it
its just one of billions of galaxies in the universe
there are a billion stars in the galactic core which is why its shining out so brightly
this is about million light years away so one of our neighboring galaxies
but that bright star there is actually one of the stars in the galaxy
so that star is also million light years away
its part of that galaxy and its shining as brightly as the center of the galaxy with a billion suns in it
thats a type ia supernova explosion
now thats an incredible phenomena because its a star that sits there
its called a carbon oxygen dwarf
it sits there about say times the mass of the sun
and it has a binary companion that goes around it so a big star a big ball of gas
and what it does is it sucks gas off its companion star until it gets to this limit called the chandrasekhar limit and then it explodes
and it explodes and it shines as brightly as a billion suns for about two weeks and releases not only energy but a huge amount of chemical elements into the universe
in fact that one is a carbon oxygen dwarf
now there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe at the big bang
and there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe throughout the first generation of stars
it was made in stars like that locked away and then returned to the universe in explosions like that in order to recondense into planets stars new solar systems and indeed people like us
i think thats a remarkable demonstration of the power and beauty and universality of the laws of physics because we understand that process because we understand the structure of atoms here on earth
this is a beautiful quote that i found were talking about serendipity there from alexander fleming when i woke up just after dawn on september i certainly didnt plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the worlds first antibiotic
now the explorers of the world of the atom did not intend to invent the transistor
and they certainly didnt intend to describe the mechanics of supernova explosions which eventually told us where the building blocks of life were synthesized in the universe
so i think science can be serendipity is important
it can be beautiful it can reveal quite astonishing things
it can also i think finally reveal the most profound ideas to us about our place in the universe and really the value of our home planet
this is a spectacular picture of our home planet
now it doesnt look like our home planet
it looks like saturn because of course it is
it was taken by the cassini space probe
but its a famous picture not because of the beauty and majesty of saturns rings but actually because of a tiny faint blob just hanging underneath one of the rings
and if i blow it up there you see it
it looks like a moon but in fact its a picture of earth
it was a picture of earth captured in that frame of saturn
thats our planet from million miles away
i think the earth has got a strange property that the farther away you get from it the more beautiful it seems
but that is not the most distant or most famous picture of our planet
it was taken by this thing which is called the voyager spacecraft
and thats a picture of me in front of it for scale
the voyager is a tiny machine
its currently billion miles away from earth transmitting with that dish with the power of watts and were still in contact with it
but it visited jupiter saturn uranus and neptune
and after it visited all four of those planets carl sagan whos one of my great heroes had the wonderful idea of turning voyager around and taking a picture of every planet it had visited
and it took this picture of earth
now its very hard to see the earth there its called the pale blue dot picture but earth is suspended in that red shaft of light
thats earth from four billion miles away
and id like to read you what sagan wrote about it just to finish because i cannot say words as beautiful as this to describe what he saw in that picture that he had taken
he said consider again that dot
thats here thats home thats us
on it everyone you love everyone you know everyone youve ever heard of every human being who ever was lived out their lives
the aggregates of joy and suffering thousands of confident religions ideologies and economic doctrines every hunter and forager every hero and coward every creator and destroyer of civilization every king and peasant every young couple in love every mother and father hopeful child inventor and explorer every teacher of morals every corrupt politician every superstar every supreme leader every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam
its been said that astronomys a humbling and character building experience
there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world
to me it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot the only home weve ever known
beautiful words about the power of science and exploration
the argument has always been made and it will always be made that we know enough about the universe
you could have made it in the you wouldnt have had penicillin
you could have made it in the you wouldnt have the transistor
and its made today in these difficult economic times
surely we know enough
we dont need to discover anything else about our universe
let me leave the last words to someone whos rapidly becoming a hero of mine humphrey davy who did his science at the turn of the century
he was clearly under assault all the time
we know enough at the turn of the century
just exploit it just build things
he said this he said nothing is more fatal to the progress of the human mind than to presume that our views of science are ultimate that our triumphs are complete that there are no mysteries in nature and that there are no new worlds to conquer
thank you

title jonathan trent energy from floating algae pods title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript call it fuel without fossils jonathan trent is working on a plan to grow new biofuel by farming micro algae in floating offshore pods that eat wastewater from cities hear his teams bold vision for project omega and how it might power the future description
some years ago i set out to try to understand if there was a possibility to develop biofuels on a scale that would actually compete with fossil fuels but not compete with agriculture for water fertilizer or land
so heres what i came up with
imagine that we build an enclosure where we put it just underwater and we fill it with wastewater and some form of microalgae that produces oil and we make it out of some kind of flexible material that moves with waves underwater and the system that were going to build of course will use solar energy to grow the algae and they use which is good and they produce oxygen as they grow
the algae that grow are in a container that distributes the heat to the surrounding water and you can harvest them and make biofuels and cosmetics and fertilizer and animal feed and of course youd have to make a large area of this so youd have to worry about other stakeholders like fishermen and ships and such things but hey were talking about biofuels and we know the importance of potentially getting an alternative liquid fuel
why are we talking about microalgae
here you see a graph showing you the different types of crops that are being considered for making biofuels so you can see some things like soybean which makes gallons per acre per year or sunflower or canola or jatropha or palm and that tall graph there shows what microalgae can contribute
that is to say microalgae contributes between and gallons per acre per year compared to the gallons per acre per year from soy
so what are microalgae microalgae are micro that is theyre extremely small as you can see here a picture of those single celled organisms compared to a human hair
those small organisms have been around for millions of years and theres thousands of different species of microalgae in the world some of which are the fastest growing plants on the planet and produce as i just showed you lots and lots of oil
now why do we want to do this offshore
well the reason were doing this offshore is because if you look at our coastal cities there isnt a choice because were going to use waste water as i suggested and if you look at where most of the waste water treatment plants are theyre embedded in the cities
this is the city of san francisco which has miles of sewer pipes under the city already and it releases its waste water offshore
so different cities around the world treat their waste water differently some cities process it
some cities just release the water
but in all cases the water thats released is perfectly adequate for growing microalgae
so lets envision what the system might look like
we call it omega which is an acronym for offshore membrane enclosures for growing algae
at nasa you have to have good acronyms
so how does it work i sort of showed you how it works already
we put waste water and some source of into our floating structure and the waste water provides nutrients for the algae to grow and they sequester that would otherwise go off into the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas
they of course use solar energy to grow and the wave energy on the surface provides energy for mixing the algae and the temperature is controlled by the surrounding water temperature
the algae that grow produce oxygen as ive mentioned and they also produce biofuels and fertilizer and food and other bi algal products of interest
and the system is contained what do i mean by that
its modular lets say something happens thats totally unexpected to one of the modules
it leaks its struck by lightning
the waste water that leaks out is water that already now goes into that coastal environment and the algae that leak out are biodegradable and because theyre living in waste water theyre fresh water algae which means they cant live in salt water so they die
the plastic well build it out of is some kind of well known plastic that we have good experience with and well rebuild our modules to be able to reuse them again
so we may be able to go beyond that when thinking about this system that im showing you and that is to say we need to think in terms of the water the fresh water which is also going to be an issue in the future and were working on methods now for recovering the waste water
the other thing to consider is the structure itself
it provides a surface for things in the ocean and this surface which is covered by seaweeds and other organisms in the ocean will become enhanced marine habitat so it increases biodiversity
and finally because its an offshore structure we can think in terms of how it might contribute to an aquaculture activity offshore
so youre probably thinking gee this sounds like a good idea what can we do to try to see if its real
well i set up laboratories in santa cruz at the california fish and game facility and that facility allowed us to have big seawater tanks to test some of these ideas
we also set up experiments in san francisco at one of the three waste water treatment plants again a facility to test ideas
and finally we wanted to see where we could look at what the impact of this structure would be in the marine environment and we set up a field site at a place called moss landing marine lab in monterey bay where we worked in a harbor to see what impact this would have on marine organisms
the laboratory that we set up in santa cruz was our skunkworks
it was a place where we were growing algae and welding plastic and building tools and making a lot of mistakes or as edison said we were finding the ways that the system wouldnt work
now we grew algae in waste water and we built tools that allowed us to get into the lives of algae so that we could monitor the way they grow what makes them happy how do we make sure that were going to have a culture that will survive and thrive
so the most important feature that we needed to develop were these so called photobioreactors or pbrs
these were the structures that would be floating at the surface made out of some inexpensive plastic material thatll allow the algae to grow and we had built lots and lots of designs most of which were horrible failures and when we finally got to a design that worked at about gallons we scaled it up to gallons in san francisco
so let me show you how the system works
we basically take waste water with algae of our choice in it and we circulate it through this floating structure this tubular flexible plastic structure and it circulates through this thing and theres sunlight of course its at the surface and the algae grow on the nutrients
but this is a bit like putting your head in a plastic bag
the algae are not going to suffocate because of as we would
they suffocate because they produce oxygen and they dont really suffocate but the oxygen that they produce is problematic and they use up all the
so the next thing we had to figure out was how we could remove the oxygen which we did by building this column which circulated some of the water and put back which we did by bubbling the system before we recirculated the water
and what you see here is the prototype which was the first attempt at building this type of column
the larger column that we then installed in san francisco in the installed system
so the column actually had another very nice feature and that is the algae settle in the column and this allowed us to accumulate the algal biomass in a context where we could easily harvest it
so we would remove the algaes that concentrated in the bottom of this column and then we could harvest that by a procedure where you float the algae to the surface and can skim it off with a net
so we wanted to also investigate what would be the impact of this system in the marine environment and i mentioned we set up this experiment at a field site in moss landing marine lab
well we found of course that this material became overgrown with algae and we needed then to develop a cleaning procedure and we also looked at how seabirds and marine mammals interacted and in fact you see here a sea otter that found this incredibly interesting and would periodically work its way across this little floating water bed and we wanted to hire this guy or train him to be able to clean the surface of these things but thats for the future
now really what we were doing we were working in four areas
our research covered the biology of the system which included studying the way algae grew but also what eats the algae and what kills the algae
we did engineering to understand what we would need to be able to do to build this structure not only on the small scale but how we would build it on this enormous scale that will ultimately be required
i mentioned we looked at birds and marine mammals and looked at basically the environmental impact of the system and finally we looked at the economics and what i mean by economics is what is the energy required to run the system
do you get more energy out of the system than you have to put into the system to be able to make the system run
and what about operating costs
and what about capital costs
and what about just the whole economic structure
so let me tell you that its not going to be easy and theres lots more work to do in all four of those areas to be able to really make the system work
but we dont have a lot of time and id like to show you the artists conception of how this system might look if we find ourselves in a protected bay somewhere in the world and we have in the background in this image the waste water treatment plant and a source of flue gas for the but when you do the economics of this system you find that in fact it will be difficult to make it work
unless you look at the system as a way to treat waste water sequester carbon and potentially for photovoltaic panels or wave energy or even wind energy and if you start thinking in terms of integrating all of these different activities you could also include in such a facility aquaculture
so we would have under this system a shellfish aquaculture where were growing mussels or scallops
wed be growing oysters and things that would be producing high value products and food and this would be a market driver as we build the system to larger and larger scales so that it becomes ultimately competitive with the idea of doing it for fuels
so theres always a big question that comes up because plastic in the ocean has got a really bad reputation right now and so weve been thinking cradle to cradle
what are we going to do with all this plastic that were going to need to use in our marine environment
well i dont know if you know about this but in california theres a huge amount of plastic thats used in fields right now as plastic mulch and this is plastic thats making these tiny little greenhouses right along the surface of the soil and this provides warming the soil to increase the growing season it allows us to control weeds and of course it makes the watering much more efficient
so the omega system will be part of this type of an outcome and that when were finished using it in the marine environment well be using it hopefully on fields
where are we going to put this and what will it look like offshore
heres an image of what we could do in san francisco bay
san francisco produces million gallons a day of waste water if we imagine a five day retention time for this system wed need million gallons to accomodate and that would be about acres of these omega modules floating in san francisco bay
well thats less than one percent of the surface area of the bay
it would produce at gallons per acre per year it would produce over million gallons of fuel which is about percent of the biodiesel or of the diesel that would be required in san francisco and thats without doing anything about efficiency
where else could we potentially put this system
theres lots of possibilities
theres of course san francisco bay as i mentioned
san diego bay is another example mobile bay or chesapeake bay but the reality is as sea level rises theres going to be lots and lots of new opportunities to consider
so what im telling you about is a system of integrated activities
biofuels production is integrated with alternative energy is integrated with aquaculture
i set out to find a pathway to innovative production of sustainable biofuels and en route i discovered that whats really required for sustainability is integration more than innovation
long term i have great faith in our collective and connected ingenuity
i think there is almost no limit to what we can accomplish if we are radically open and we dont care who gets the credit
sustainable solutions for our future problems are going to be diverse and are going to be many
i think we need to consider everything everything from alpha to omega
thank you
chris anderson just a quick question for you jonathan
can this project continue to move forward within nasa or do you need some very ambitious green energy fund to come and take it by the throat
jonathan trent so its really gotten to a stage now in nasa where they would like to spin it out into something which would go offshore and there are a lot of issues with doing it in the united states because of limited permitting issues and the time required to get permits to do things offshore
it really requires at this point people on the outside and were being radically open with this technology in which were going to launch it out there for anybody and everybody whos interested to take it on and try to make it real
ca so thats interesting youre not patenting it
youre publishing it
jt absolutely
ca all right thank you so much
jt thank you

title billy collins everyday moments caught in time title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript combining dry wit with artistic depth billy collins shares a project in which several of his poems were turned into delightful animated films in a collaboration with sundance channel five of them are included in this wonderfully entertaining and moving talk and dont miss the hilarious final poem description
im here to give you your recommended dietary allowance of poetry
and the way im going to do that is present to you five animations of five of my poems
and let me just tell you a little bit of how that came about
because the mixing of those two media is a sort of unnatural or unnecessary act
but when i was united states poet laureate and i love saying that
its a great way to start sentences
when i was him back then i was approached by j walter thompson the ad company and they were hired sort of by the sundance channel
and the idea was to have me record some of my poems and then they would find animators to animate them
and i was initially resistant because i always think poetry can stand alone by itself
attempts to put my poems to music have had disastrous results in all cases
and the poem if its written with the ear already has been set to its own verbal music as it was composed
and surely if youre reading a poem that mentions a cow you dont need on the facing page a drawing of a cow
i mean lets let the reader do a little work
but i relented because it seemed like an interesting possibility and also im like a total cartoon junkie since childhood
i think more influential than emily dickinson or coleridge or wordsworth on my imagination were warner brothers merrie melodies and loony tunes cartoons
bugs bunny is my muse
and this way poetry could find its way onto television of all places
and im pretty much all for poetry in public places poetry on buses poetry on subways on billboards on cereal boxes
when i was poet laureate there i go again i cant help it its true i created a poetry channel on delta airlines that lasted for a couple of years
so you could tune into poetry as you were flying
and my sense is its a good thing to get poetry off the shelves and more into public life
start a meeting with a poem that would be an idea you might take with you
when you get a poem on a billboard or on the radio or on a cereal box or whatever it happens to you so suddenly that you dont have time to deploy your anti poetry deflector shields that were installed in high school
so let us start with the first one
its a little poem called budapest and in it i reveal or pretend to reveal the secrets of the creative process
narration budapest
my pen moves along the page like the snout of a strange animal shaped like a human arm and dressed in the sleeve of a loose green sweater
i watch it sniffing the paper ceaselessly intent as any forager that has nothing on its mind but the grubs and insects that will allow it to live another day
it wants only to be here tomorrow dressed perhaps in the sleeve of a plaid shirt nose pressed against the page writing a few more dutiful lines while i gaze out the window and imagine budapest or some other city where i have never been
bc so that makes it seem a little easier
writing is not actually as easy as that for me
but i like to pretend that it comes with ease
one of my students came up after class an introductory class and she said you know poetry is harder than writing which i found both erroneous and profound
so i like to at least pretend it just flows out
a friend of mine has a slogan hes another poet
he says that if at first you dont succeed hide all evidence you ever tried
the next poem is also rather short
poetry just says a few things in different ways
and i think you could boil this poem down to saying some days you eat the bear other days the bear eats you
and it uses the imagery of dollhouse furniture
narration some days
some days i put the people in their places at the table bend their legs at the knees if they come with that feature and fix them into the tiny wooden chairs
all afternoon they face one another the man in the brown suit the woman in the blue dress perfectly motionless perfectly behaved
but other days i am the one who is lifted up by the ribs then lowered into the dining room of a dollhouse to sit with the others at the long table
very funny
but how would you like it if you never knew from one day to the next if you were going to spend it striding around like a vivid god your shoulders in the clouds or sitting down there amidst the wallpaper staring straight ahead with your little plastic face
bc theres a horror movie in there somewhere
the next poem is called forgetfulness and its really just a kind of poetic essay on the subject of mental slippage
and the poem begins with a certain species of forgetfulness that someone called literary amnesia in other words forgetting the things that you have read
narration forgetfulness
the name of the author is the first to go followed obediently by the title the plot the heartbreaking conclusion the entire novel which suddenly becomes one you have never read never even heard of
it is as if one by one the memories you used to harbor decided to retire to the southern hemisphere of the brain to a little fishing village where there are no phones
long ago you kissed the names of the nine muses good bye and you watched the quadratic equation pack its bag
and even now as you memorize the order of the planets something else is slipping away a state flower perhaps the address of an uncle the capital of paraguay
whatever it is you are struggling to remember it is not poised on the tip of your tongue not even lurking in some obscure corner of your spleen
it has floated away down a dark mythological river whose name begins with an l as far as you can recall well on your own way to oblivion where you will join those who have forgotten even how to swim and how to ride a bicycle
no wonder you rise in the middle of the night to look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war
no wonder the moon in the window seems to have drifted out of a love poem that you used to know by heart
bc the next poem is called the country and its based on when i was in college i met a classmate who remains to be a friend of mine
he lived and still does in rural vermont
i lived in new york city
and we would visit each other
and when i would go up to the country he would teach me things like deer hunting which meant getting lost with a gun basically and trout fishing and stuff like that
and then hed come down to new york city and id teach him what i knew which was largely smoking and drinking
and in that way we traded lore with each other
the poem thats coming up is based on him trying to tell me a little something about a domestic point of etiquette in country living that i had a very hard time at first processing
its called the country
narration the country
i wondered about you when you told me never to leave a box of wooden strike anywhere matches just lying around the house because the mice might get into them and start a fire
but your face was absolutely straight when you twisted the lid down on the round tin where the matches you said are always stowed
who could sleep that night
who could whisk away the thought of the one unlikely mouse padding along a cold water pipe behind the floral wallpaper gripping a single wooden match between the needles of his teeth
who could not see him rounding a corner the blue tip scratching against rough hewn beam the sudden flare and the creature for one bright shining moment suddenly thrust ahead of his time now a fire starter now a torch bearer in a forgotten ritual little brown druid illuminating some ancient night
and who could fail to notice lit up in the blazing insulation the tiny looks of wonderment on the faces of his fellow mice one time inhabitants of what once was your house in the country
bc thank you
thank you and the last poem is called the dead
i wrote this after a friends funeral but not so much about the friend as something the eulogist kept saying as all eulogists tend to do which is how happy the deceased would be to look down and see all of us assembled
and that to me was a bad start to the afterlife having to witness your own funeral and feel gratified
so the little poem is called the dead
narration the dead
the dead are always looking down on us they say
while we are putting on our shoes or making a sandwich they are looking down through the glass bottom boats of heaven as they row themselves slowly through eternity
they watch the tops of our heads moving below on earth
and when we lie down in a field or on a couch drugged perhaps by the hum of a warm afternoon they think we are looking back at them which makes them lift their oars and fall silent and wait like parents for us to close our eyes
bc im not sure if other poems will be animated
it took a long time i mean its rather uncommon to have this marriage a long time to put those two together
but then again it took us a long time to put the wheel and the suitcase together
i mean we had the wheel for some time
and schlepping is an ancient and honorable art
i just have time to read a more recent poem to you
if it has a subject the subject is adolescence
and its addressed to a certain person
its called to my favorite year old high school girl
do you realize that if you had started building the parthenon on the day you were born you would be all done in only one more year
of course you couldnt have done that all alone
so never mind youre fine just being yourself
youre loved for just being you
but did you know that at your age judy garland was pulling down dollars a picture joan of arc was leading the french army to victory and blaise pascal had cleaned up his room no wait i mean he had invented the calculator
of course there will be time for all that later in your life after you come out of your room and begin to blossom or at least pick up all your socks
for some reason i keep remembering that lady jane grey was queen of england when she was only
but then she was beheaded so never mind her as a role model
a few centuries later when he was your age franz schubert was doing the dishes for his family but that did not keep him from composing two symphonies four operas and two complete masses as a youngster
but of course that was in austria at the height of romantic lyricism not here in the suburbs of cleveland
frankly who cares if annie oakley was a crack shot at or if maria callas debuted as tosca at
we think youre special just being you playing with your food and staring into space
by the way i lied about schubert doing the dishes but that doesnt mean he never helped out around the house
thank you thank you
thanks

title janna levin the sound the universe makes title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript we think of space as a silent place but physicist janna levin says the universe has a soundtrack a sonic composition that records some of the most dramatic events in outer space an accessible and mind expanding soundwalk through the universe description
i want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that by far most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light
we can stand on the earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes
the sun burns our peripheral vision
we see light reflected off the moon
and in the time since galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies the known universe has come to us through light across vast eras in cosmic history
and with all of our modern telescopes weve been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe these series of snapshots that go all the way back to the big bang
and yet the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isnt silent
id like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on space itself because space can wobble like a drum
it can ring out a kind of recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold
now wed like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe a sonic composition
and while weve never heard the sounds from space we really should in the next few years start to turn up the volume on whats going on out there
so in this ambition to capture songs from the universe we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have because black holes can bang on space time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song which id like to play for you some of our predictions for what that song will be like
now black holes are dark against a dark sky
we cant see them directly
theyre not brought to us with light at least not directly
we can see them indirectly because black holes wreak havoc on their environment
they destroy stars around them
they churn up debris in their surroundings
but they wont come to us directly through light
we might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background but we havent yet
and yet black holes may be heard even if theyre not seen and thats because they bang on space time like a drum
now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to albert einstein to whom we owe so much
einstein realized that if space were empty if the universe were empty it would be like this picture except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it
but if we were freely falling through the space even without this helpful grid we might be able to paint it ourselves because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines undeflected straight paths through the universe
einstein also realized and this is the real meat of the matter that if you put energy or mass in the universe it would curve space and a freely falling object would pass by lets say the sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in the space
it was einsteins great general theory of relativity
now even light will be bent by those paths
and you can be bent so much that youre caught in orbit around the sun as the earth is or the moon around the earth
these are the natural curves in space
what einstein did not realize was that if you took our sun and you crushed it down to six kilometers so you took a million times the mass of the earth and you crushed it to six kilometers across you would make a black hole an object so dense that if light veered too close it would never escape a dark shadow against the universe
it wasnt einstein who realized this it was karl schwarzschild who was a german jew in world war i joined the german army already an accomplished scientist working on the russian front
i like to imagine schwarzschild in the war in the trenches calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire and then in between calculating einsteins equations as you do in the trenches
and he was reading einsteins recently published general theory of relativity and he was thrilled by this theory
and he quickly surmised an exact mathematical solution that described something very extraordinary curves so strong that space would rain down into them space itself would curve like a waterfall flowing down the throat of a hole
and even light could not escape this current
light would be dragged down the hole as everything else would be and all that would be left would be a shadow
now he wrote to einstein and he said as you will see the war has been kind to me enough
despite the heavy gunfire ive been able to get away from it all and walk through the land of your ideas
and einstein was very impressed with his exact solution and i should hope also the dedication of the scientist
this is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions
and he took schwarzschilds idea to the prussian academy of sciences the next week
but einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity
he did not believe they existed in nature
he thought nature would protect us from their formation
it was decades before the term black hole was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects in fact theyre the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime
now our sun will not collapse to a black hole
its actually not massive enough
but if we did a little thought experiment as einstein was very fond of doing we could imagine putting the sun crushed down to six kilometers and putting a tiny little earth around it in orbit maybe kilometers outside of the black hole sun
and it would be self illuminated because now the suns gone we have no other source of light so lets make our little earth self illuminated
and you would realize you could put the earth in a happy orbit even km outside of this crushed black hole
this crushed black hole actually would fit inside manhattan more or less
it might spill off into the hudson a little bit before it destroyed the earth
but basically thats what were talking about
were talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of manhattan
so we move this earth very close kilometers outside and we notice its perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole
theres a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe but you actually have to get very close to fall in
but whats very impressive is that from our vantage point we can always see the earth
it cannot hide behind the black hole
the light from the earth some of it falls in but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us
so you cant hide anything behind a black hole
if this were battlestar galactica and youre fighting the cylons dont hide behind the black hole
they can see you
now our sun will not collapse to a black hole its not massive enough but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy
and if one were to eclipse the milky way this is what it would look like
we would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the milky way galaxy and its luminous dust lanes
and if we were to fall towards this black hole we would see all of that light lensed around it and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened
it would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldnt anymore than light can escape
but even though the black hole is dark from the outside its not dark on the inside because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us
and even though due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us right before we were crushed to death by the black hole
it would be like a near death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel but its a total death experience
and theres no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel
now weve never seen a shadow like this of a black hole but black holes can be heard even if theyre not seen
imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together
maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes each one times the mass of the sun
so now were going to crush them down to kilometers across
they can be spinning hundreds of times a second
at the end of their lives theyre going around each other very near the speed of light
so theyre crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second and as they do so they not only curve space but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space an actual wave on space time
space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe
and they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light
this computer simulation is due to a relativity group at nasa goddard
it took almost years for anyone in the world to crack this problem
this was one of the groups
it shows two black holes in orbit around each other again with these helpfully painted curves
and if you can see its kind of faint but if you can see the red waves emanating out those are the gravitational waves
theyre literally the sounds of space ringing and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coalesce to one spinning quiet black hole at the end of the day
if you were standing near enough your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space
you would literally hear the sound
now of course your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully so you might have trouble understanding whats going on
but id like to play for you the sound that we predict
this is from my group a slightly less glamorous computer modeling
imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole
the sound youre hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close
if it gets far away its a little too quiet
but it comes in like a mallet and it literally cracks space wobbling it like a drum
and we can predict what the sound will be
we know that as it falls in it gets faster and it gets louder
and eventually were going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy
then its gone
now ive never heard it that loud its actually more dramatic
at home it sounds kind of anticlimactic
its sort of like ding ding ding
this is another sound from my group
no im not showing you any images because black holes dont leave behind helpful trails of ink and space is not painted showing you the curves
but if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this you want to get moving
want to get away from the sound
both black holes are moving
both black holes are getting closer together
in this case theyre both wobbling quite a lot
and then theyre going to merge
now its gone
now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging that it chirps up at the end
now thats our prediction for what well see
luckily were at this safe distance in long beach california
and surely somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged
and surely the space around us is ringing after traveling maybe a million light years or a million years at the speed of light to get to us
but the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear
there are very industrious experiments being built on earth one called ligo which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers
its a remarkably ambitious experiment and its going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years to pick this up
theres also a mission proposed for space which hopefully will launch in the next ten years called lisa
and lisa will be able to see super massive black holes black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the sun
in this hubble image we see two galaxies
they look like theyre frozen in some embrace
and each one probably harbors a super massive black hole at its core
but theyre not frozen theyre actually merging
these two black holes are colliding and they will merge over a billion year time scale
its beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration
but lisa could see the final stages of two super massive black holes earlier in the universes history the last minutes before they fall together
and its not just black holes but its also any big disturbance in the universe and the biggest of them all is the big bang
when that expression was coined it was derisive like oh who would believe in a big bang
but now it actually might be more technically accurate because it might bang
it might make a sound
this animation from my friends at proton studios shows looking at the big bang from the outside
we dont ever want to do that actually we want to be inside the universe because theres no such thing as standing outside the universe
so imagine youre inside the big bang
its everywhere its all around you and the space is wobbling chaotically
fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us
galaxies form and generations of stars form in those galaxies and around one star at least one star is a habitable planet
and here we are frantically building these experiments doing these calculations writing these computer codes
imagine a billion years ago two black holes collided
that song has been ringing through space for all that time
we werent even here
it gets closer and closer years ago were still doing cave paintings
its like hurry build your instruments
its getting closer and closer and in
whatever year it will be when our detectors are finally at advanced sensitivity well build them well turn on the machines and bang well catch it the first song from space
if it was the big bang we were going to pick up it would sound like this
its a terrible sound
its literally the definition of noise
its white noise its such a chaotic ringing
but its around us everywhere presumably if it hasnt been wiped out by some other process in the universe
and if we pick it up it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation of our observable universe
so within the next few years well be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit render the universe in audio
but if we detect those earliest moments itll bring us that much closer to an understanding of the big bang which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest most elusive questions
if we run the movie of our universe backwards we know that there was a big bang in our past and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it but was our big bang the only big bang
i mean we have to ask has it happened before
will it happen again
i mean in the spirit of rising to teds challenge to reignite wonder we can ask questions at least for this last minute that honestly might evade us forever
but we have to ask is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history
or is it possible that were just a branch off of a multiverse each branch with its own big bang in its past maybe some of them with black holes playing drums maybe some without maybe some with sentient life and maybe some without not in our past not in our future but somehow fundamentally connected to us
so we have to wonder if there is a multiverse in some other patch of that multiverse are there creatures
heres my multiverse creatures
are there other creatures in the multiverse wondering about us and wondering about their own origins
and if they are i can imagine them as we are calculating writing computer code building instruments trying to detect that faintest sound of their origins and wondering who else is out there

chris anderson you guys were amazing
thats amazing
you just dont hear that every day
usman the official story is that you learned to play the guitar by watching jimmy page on youtube
usman riaz yes that was the first one and then i that was the first thing i learned and then i started progressing to other things
and i started watching kaki king a lot and she would always cite preston reed as a big influence so then i started watching his videos and its very surreal right now to be ca was that piece just now that was one of his songs that you learned or how did that happen
ur id never learned it before but he told me that we would be playing that on stage so i was familiar with it so thats why i had so much more fun learning it
and it finally happened so
ca preston from your point of view i mean you invented this like years ago right
how does it feel to see someone like this come along taking your art and doing so much with it
preston reed its mind blowing and i feel really proud really honored
and hes a wonderful musician so its cool
ca i guess i dont think there is like a one minute other piece you guys can do
can you do you jam do you have anything else
pr we havent prepared anything
ca there isnt ill tell you what
if you have another or seconds and you have another or seconds and we just see that i just think i can feel it we want to hear a little more
and if it goes horribly wrong no worries

title joe kowan how i beat stage fright title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript humanitys fine tuned sense of fear served us well as a young species giving us laser focus to avoid being eaten by competing beasts but its less wonderful when that same visceral body hijacking sense of fear kicks in in front of folk music fans at a tuesday night open mic palms sweat hands shake vision blurs and the brain says run its stage fright in this charming tuneful little talk joe kowan talks about how he conquered it description
joe kowan i have stage fright
ive always had stage fright and not just a little bit its a big bit
and it didnt even matter until i was
thats when i started writing songs and even then i only played them for myself
just knowing my roommates were in the same house made me uncomfortable
but after a couple of years just writing songs wasnt enough
i had all these stories and ideas and i wanted to share them with people but physiologically i couldnt do it
i had this irrational fear
but the more i wrote and the more i practiced the more i wanted to perform
so on the week of my birthday i decided i was going to go to this local open mic and put this fear behind me
well when i got there it was packed
there were like people there
and they all looked angry
but i took a deep breath and i signed up to play and i felt pretty good
pretty good until about minutes before my turn when my whole body rebelled and this wave of anxiety just washed over me
now when you experience fear your sympathetic nervous system kicks in
so you have a rush of adrenaline your heart rate increases your breathing gets faster
next your non essential systems start to shut down like digestion
so your mouth gets dry and blood is routed away from your extremities so your fingers dont work anymore
your pupils dilate your muscles contract your spidey sense tingles basically your whole body is trigger happy
that condition is not conducive to performing folk music
i mean your nervous system is an idiot
really two hundred thousand years of human evolution and it still cant tell the difference between a saber tooth tiger and folksingers on a tuesday night open mic
i have never been more terrified until now
so then it was my turn and somehow i get myself onto the stage i start my song i open my mouth to sing the first line and this completely horrible vibrato you know when your voice wavers comes streaming out
and this is not the good kind of vibrato like an opera singer has this is my whole body just convulsing with fear
i mean its a nightmare
im embarrassed the audience is clearly uncomfortable theyre focused on my discomfort
it was so bad
but that was my first real experience as a solo singer songwriter
and something good did happen i had the tiniest little glimpse of that audience connection that i was hoping for
and i wanted more but i knew i had to get past this nervousness
that night i promised myself i would go back every week until i wasnt nervous anymore
and i did i went back every single week and sure enough week after week it didnt get any better the same thing happened every week
i couldnt shake it
and thats when i had an epiphany
and i remember it really well because i dont have a lot of epiphanies
all i had to do was write a song that exploits my nervousness
that only seems authentic when i have stage fright and the more nervous i was the better the song would be easy
so i started writing a song about having stage fright
first fessing up to the problem the physical manifestations how i would feel how the listener might feel
and then accounting for things like my shaky voice and i knew i would be singing about a half octave higher than normal because i was nervous
by having a song that explained what was happening to me while it was happening that gave the audience permission to think about it
they didnt have to feel bad for me because i was nervous they could experience that with me and we were all one big happy nervous uncomfortable family
by thinking about my audience by embracing and exploiting my problem i was able to take something that was blocking my progress and turn it into something that was essential for my success
and having the stage fright song let me get past that biggest issue right in the beginning of a performance
and then i could move on and play the rest of my songs with just a little bit more ease
and eventually over time i didnt have to play the stage fright song at all
except for when i was really nervous like now
would it be okay if i played the stage fright song for you
can i have a sip of water
thank you

title wolfgang kessling how to air condition outdoor spaces title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript during the hot summer months watching an outdoor sports match or concert can be tantamount to baking uncomfortably in the sun but it doesn t have to be at the tedxsummit in doha physicist wolfgang kessling reveals sustainable design innovations that cool us from above and below and even collects solar energy for later use description
good evening
we are in this wonderful open air amphitheater and we are enjoying ourselves in that mild evening temperature tonight but when qatar will host the football world cup years from now we already heard it will be in the hot very hot and sunny summer months of june and july
and when qatar has been assigned to the world cup all many people around the world have been wondering how would it be possible that football players show spectacular football run around in this desert climate how would it be possible that spectators sit enjoy themselves in open air stadia in this hot environment
together with the architects of albert speer amp partner our engineers from transsolar have been supporting have been developing open air stadia based on percent solar power on percent solar cooling
let me tell you about that but let me start with comfort
let me start with the aspect of comfort because many people are confusing ambient temperature with thermal comfort
we are used to looking at charts like that and you see this red line showing the air temperature in june and july and yes thats right its picking up to degrees c
its actually very hot
but air temperature is not the full set of climatic parameters which define comfort
let me show you analysis a colleague of mine did looking on different football world cups olympic games around the world looking on the comfort and analyzing the comfort people have perceived at these different sport activities and let me start with mexico
mexico temperature has been air temperature has been something between up to degrees c and people enjoyed themselves
it was a very comfortable game in mexico city have a look
orlando same kind of stadium open air stadium people have been sitting in the strong sun in the very high humidity in the afternoon and they did not enjoy it was not comfortable
the air temperature was not too high but it was not comfortable during these games
what about seoul seoul because of broadcast rights all the games have been in the late afternoon sun has already been set so the games have been perceived as comfortable
what about athens mediterranean climate but in the sun it was not comfortable they didnt perceive comfort
and we know that from spain we know that sol y sombra
if you have a ticket and you get a ticket for the shade you pay more because youre in a more comfortable environment
what about beijing
its again sun in the day and high humidity and it was not comfortable
so if i overlay and if you overlay all these comfort envelopes what we see is in all these places air temperature has been ranging something from to and if you go on the line of degrees c ambient temperatures if you go along that line you see there has been all kind of comfort all kinds of perceived outdoor comfort ranging from very comfortable to very uncomfortable
so why is that
this is because there are more parameters influencing our thermal comfort which is the sun the direct sun the diffuse sun which is wind strong wind mild wind which is air humidity which is the radiant temperature of the surroundings where we are in
and this is air temperature
all these parameters go into the comfort feeling of our human body and scientists have developed a parameter which is the perceived temperature where all these parameters go in and help designers to understand which is the driving parameter that i feel comfort or that i dont feel comfort
which is the driving parameter which gives me a perceived temperature and these parameters these climatic parameters are related to the human metabolism
because of our metabolism we as human beings we produce heat
im excited im talking to you im probably producing watts at the moment you are sitting you are relaxed youre looking at me its probably watts each person is producing and we need to get rid of that energy i need with my body to get rid of the energy and the harder it is for myself for my body to get rid of the energy the less comfort i feel
thats it and if i dont get rid of the energy i will die
if we overlay what happens during the football world cup what will happen in june july we will see yes air temperature will be much higher but because the games and the plays will be in the afternoon its probably the same comfort rating weve found in other places which has perceived as non comfortable
so we sat together with a team which prepared the bid book or goal that we said lets aim for perceived temperature for outdoor comfort in this range which is perceived with a temperature of degrees celsius perceived temperature which is extremely comfortable
people would feel really fine in an open outdoor environment
but what does it mean
if we just look on what happens we see temperatures too high
if we apply the best architectural design climate engineering design we wont get much better
so we need to do something active
we need for instance to bring in radiant cooling technology and we need to combine this with so called soft conditioning
and how does it look like in a stadium
so the stadium has a few elements which create that outdoor comfort first of all its shading it needs to protect where the people are sitting against strong and warm wind
but thats not all what we need to do we need to use active systems
instead of blowing a hurricane of chilled air through the stadium we can use radiant cooling technologies like a floor heating system where water pipes are embedded in the floor
and just by using cold water going through the water pipes you can release the heat which is absorbed during the day in the stadium so you can create that comfort and then by adding dry air instead of down chilled air the spectators and the football players can adjust to their individual comfort needs to their individual energy balance
they can adjust and find their comfort they need to find
there are stadia probably to come but there are training pitches where all the individual countries are going to train
we applied the same concept shading of the training pitch using a shelter against wind then using the grass
natural watered lawn is a very good cooling source stabilizing temperature and using dehumidified air to create comfort
but even the best passive design wouldnt help
we need active system
and how do we do that
our idea for the bid was percent solar cooling based on the idea that we use the roof of the stadia we cover the roofs of the stadia with pv systems
we dont borrow any energy from history
we are not using fossil energies
we are not borrowing energy from our neighbors
were using energy we can harvest on our roofs and also on the training pitches which will be covered with large flexible membranes and we will see in the next years an industry coming up with flexible photovoltaics giving the possibilities of shading against strong sun and producing electric energy in the same time
and this energy now is harvested throughout the year sent into the grid is replacing fossils in the grid and when i need it for the cooling i take it back from the grid and i use the solar energy which i have brought to the grid back when i need it for the solar cooling
and i can do that in the first year and i can balance that in the next and the next years this energy which is necessary to condition a world cup in qatar the next years this energy goes into the grid of qatar
so this thank you very much
this is not only useful for stadia we can use that also in open air places and streets and weve been working on the city of the future in masdar which is in the united emirates abu dhabi
and i had the pleasure to work on the central plaza
and the same idea to use there to create outdoor conditions which are perceived as comfortable people enjoy going there instead of going into a shopping mall which is chilled down and which is cooled we wanted to create an outdoor space which is so comfortable that people can go there in the early afternoon even in these sunny and hot summer months and they can enjoy and meet there with their families
and the same concept shade against the sun shade against the wind and use use and take advantage of the sun you can harvest on your footprint
and these beautiful umbrellas
so id like to encourage you to pay attention to your thermal comfort to your thermal environment tonight and tomorrow and if youd like to learn more about that i invite you to go to our website
we uploaded a very simple perceived temperature calculator where you can check out about your outdoor comfort
and i also hope that you share the idea that if engineers and designers can use all these different climatic parameters it will be possible to create really good and comfortable outdoor conditions to change our thermal perception that we feel comfortable in an outdoor environment and we can do that with the best passive design but also using the energy source of the site in qatar which is the sun
thank you very much

title alan kay a powerful idea about ideas title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript with all the intensity and brilliance for which he is known alan kay envisions better techniques for teaching kids by using computers to illustrate experience in ways – mathematically and scientifically that only computers can description
a great way to start i think with my view of simplicity is to take a look at ted here you are understanding why were here whats going on with no difficulty at all
the best a i in the planet would find it complex and confusing and my little dog watson would find it simple and understandable but would miss the point
he would have a great time
and of course if youre a speaker here like hans rosling a speaker finds this complex tricky but in hans roslings case he had a secret weapon yesterday literally in his sword swallowing act
and i must say i thought of quite a few objects that i might try to swallow today and finally gave up on but he just did it and that was a wonderful thing
so puck meant not only are we fools in the pejorative sense but that were easily fooled in fact what shakespeare was pointing out is we go to the theater in order to be fooled so were actually looking forward to it
we go to magic shows in order to be fooled
and this makes many things fun but it makes it difficult to actually get any kind of picture on the world we live in or on ourselves
and our friend betty edwards the drawing on the right side of the brain lady shows these two tables to her drawing class and says the problem you have with learning to draw is not that you cant move your hand but that the way your brain perceives images is faulty
its trying to perceive images into objects rather than seeing whats there
and to prove it she says the exact size and shape of these tabletops is the same and im going to prove it to you
she does this with cardboard but since i have an expensive computer here ill just rotate this little guy around and
now having seen that and ive seen it hundreds of times because i use this in every talk i give i still cant see that theyre the same size and shape and i doubt that you can either
so what do artists do well what artists do is to measure
they measure very very carefully
and if you measure very very carefully with a stiff arm and a straight edge youll see that those two shapes are exactly the same size
and the talmud saw this a long time ago saying we see things not as they are but as we are
i certainly would like to know what happened to the person who had that insight back then if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion
so if the world is not as it seems and we see things as we are then what we call reality is a kind of hallucination happening inside here its a waking dream and understanding that that is what we actually exist in is one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history
and what that means simple and understandable might not be actually simple or understandable and things we think are complex might be made simple and understandable
somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our flaws
we can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel
the way i think of it is we cant learn to see until we admit were blind
once you start down at this very humble level then you can start finding ways to see things
and whats happened over the last years in particular is that human beings have invented brainlets little additional parts for our brain made out of powerful ideas that help us see the world in different ways
and these are in the form of sensory apparatus telescopes microscopes reasoning apparatus various ways of thinking and most importantly in the ability to change perspective on things
ill talk about that a little bit
its this change in perspective on what it is we think were perceiving that has helped us make more progress in the last years than we have in the rest of human history
and yet it is not taught in any k through curriculum in america that im aware of
so one of the things that goes from simple to complex is when we do more we like more
if we do more in a kind of a stupid way the simplicity gets complex and in fact we can keep on doing it for a very long time
but murray gell mann yesterday talked about emergent properties another name for them could be architecture as a metaphor for taking the same old material and thinking about non obvious non simple ways of combining it
and in fact what murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature of having the descriptions at various levels be rather similar all goes down to the idea that the elementary particles are both sticky and standoffish and theyre in violent motion
those three things give rise to all the different levels of what seem to be complexity in our world
but how simple
so when i saw roslings gapminder stuff a few years ago i just thought it was the greatest thing id seen in conveying complex ideas simply
but then i had a thought of boy maybe its too simple
and i put some effort in to try and check to see how well these simple portrayals of trends over time actually matched up with some ideas and investigations from the side and i found that they matched up very well
so the roslings have been able to do simplicity without removing whats important about the data
whereas the film yesterday that we saw of the simulation of the inside of a cell as a former molecular biologist i didnt like that at all
not because it wasnt beautiful or anything but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand about molecular biology and that is why is there any probability at all of two complex shapes finding each other just the right way so they combine together and be catalyzed
and what we saw yesterday was every reaction was fortuitous they just swooped in the air and bound and something happened
but in fact those molecules are spinning at the rate of about a million revolutions per second theyre agitating back and forth their size every two nanoseconds theyre completely crowded together theyre jammed theyre bashing up against each other
and if you dont understand that in your mental model of this stuff what happens inside of a cell seems completely mysterious and fortuitous and i think thats exactly the wrong image for when youre trying to teach science
so another thing that we do is to confuse adult sophistication with the actual understanding of some principle
so a kid whos in high school gets this version of the pythagorean theorem which is a truly subtle and interesting proof but in fact its not a good way to start learning about mathematics
so a more direct one one that gives you more of the feeling of math is something closer to pythagoras own proof which goes like this so here we have this triangle and if we surround that c square with three more triangles and we copy that notice that we can move those triangles down like this
and that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious
and bingo that is all you have to do
and this kind of proof is the kind of proof that you need to learn when youre learning mathematics in order to get an idea of what it means before you look into the literally or proofs of pythagoras theorem that have been discovered
now lets go to young children
this is a very unusual teacher who was a kindergarten and first grade teacher but was a natural mathematician
so she was like that jazz musician friend you have who never studied music but is a terrific musician she just had a feeling for math
and here are her six year olds and shes got them making shapes out of a shape
so they pick a shape they like like a diamond or a square or a triangle or a trapezoid and then they try and make the next larger shape of that same shape and the next larger shape
you can see the trapezoids are a little challenging there
and what this teacher did on every project was to have the children act like first it was a creative arts project and then something like science
so they had created these artifacts
now she had them look at them and do this laborious which i thought for a long time until she explained to me was to slow them down so theyll think
so theyre cutting out the little pieces of cardboard here and pasting them up
but the whole point of this thing is for them to look at this chart and fill it out
what have you noticed about what you did
and so six year old lauren there noticed that the first one took one and the second one took three more and the total was four on that one the third one took five more and the total was nine on that one and then the next one
she saw right away that the additional tiles that you had to add around the edges was always going to grow by two so she was very confident about how she made those numbers there
and she could see that these were the square numbers up until about six where she wasnt sure what six times six was and what seven times seven was but then she was confident again
so thats what lauren did
and then the teacher gillian ishijima had the kids bring all of their projects up to the front of the room and put them on the floor and everybody went batshit holy shit theyre the same
no matter what the shapes were the growth law is the same
and the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd will recognize these two progressions as a first order discrete differential equation and a second order discrete differential equation derived by six year olds
well thats pretty amazing
that isnt what we usually try to teach six year olds
so lets take a look now at how we might use the computer for some of this
and so the first idea here is just to show you the kind of things that children do
im using the software that were putting on the laptop
so id like to draw a little car here ill just do this very quickly and put a big tire on him
and i get a little object here and i can look inside this object ill call it a car and heres a little behavior car forward
each time i click it car turn
if i want to make a little script to do this over and over again i just drag these guys out and set them going
and i can try steering the car here by
see the car turn by five here
so what if i click this down to zero
it goes straight thats a big revelation for nine year olds
make it go in the other direction
but of course thats a little bit like kissing your sister as far as driving a car so the kids want to do a steering wheel so they draw a steering wheel
and well call this a wheel
see this wheels heading here
if i turn this wheel you can see that number over there going minus and positive
thats kind of an invitation to pick up this name of those numbers coming out there and to just drop it into the script here and now i can steer the car with the steering wheel
and its interesting
you know how much trouble the children have with variables but by learning it this way in a situated fashion they never forget from this single trial what a variable is and how to use it
and we can reflect here the way gillian ishijima did
so if you look at the little script here the speed is always going to be
were going to move the car according to that over and over again
and im dropping a little dot for each one of these things theyre evenly spaced because theyre apart
and what if i do this progression that the six year olds did of saying ok im going to increase the speed by two each time and then im going to increase the distance by the speed each time
what do i get there
we get a visual pattern of what these nine year olds called acceleration
so how do the children do science
teacher objects that you think will fall to the earth at the same time
student ooh this is nice
teacher do not pay any attention to what anybody else is doing
whos got the apple
alan kay theyve got little stopwatches
student what did you get what did you get
ak stopwatches arent accurate enough
student seconds
teacher so put sponge ball
student do the shot put and the sponge ball because theyre two totally different weights and if you drop them at the same time maybe theyll drop at the same speed
teacher drop class whoa
ak so obviously aristotle never asked a child about this particular point because of course he didnt bother doing the experiment and neither did st thomas aquinas
and it was not until galileo actually did it that an adult thought like a child only years ago
we get one child like that about every classroom of kids who will actually cut straight to the chase
now what if we want to look at this more closely
we can take a movie of whats going on but even if we single stepped this movie its tricky to see whats going on
and so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side or stack them up
so when the children see this they say ah acceleration remembering back four months when they did their cars sideways and they start measuring to find out what kind of acceleration it is
so what im doing is measuring from the bottom of one image to the bottom of the next image about a fifth of a second later like that and theyre getting faster and faster each time and if i stack these guys up then we see the differences the increase in the speed is constant
and they say oh yeah constant acceleration
weve done that already
and how shall we look and verify that we actually have it
so you cant tell much from just making the ball drop there but if we drop the ball and run the movie at the same time we can see that we have come up with an accurate physical model
galileo by the way did this very cleverly by running a ball backwards down the strings of his lute
i pulled out those apples to remind myself to tell you that this is actually probably a newton and the apple type story but its a great story
and i thought i would do just one thing on the laptop here just to prove that this stuff works here
so once you have gravity heres this increase the speed by something increase the ships speed
if i start the little game here that the kids have done itll crash the space ship
but if i oppose gravity here we go oops
one more
yeah there we go yeah ok
i guess the best way to end this is with two quotes marshall mcluhan said children are the messages that we send to the future but in fact if you think of it children are the future we send to the future
forget about messages children are the future and children in the first and second world and most especially in the third world need mentors
and this summer were going to build five million of these laptops and maybe million next year
but we couldnt create new teachers this summer to save our life
that means that we once again have a thing where we can put technology out but the mentoring that is required to go from a simple new ichat instant messaging system to something with depth is missing
i believe this has to be done with a new kind of user interface and this new kind of user interface could be done with an expenditure of about million dollars
it sounds like a lot but it is literally minutes of what were spending in iraq were spending billion dollars a month minutes is million dollars so this is actually cheap
and einstein said things should be as simple as possible but not simpler

title emma teeling the secret of the bat genome title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript in western society bats are often characterized as creepy even evil zoologist emma teeling encourages us to rethink our attitude toward bats whose unique and fascinating biology gives us insight into our own genetic makeup description
what i want you all to do right now is to think of this mammal that im going to describe to you
the first thing im going to tell you about this mammal is that it is essential for our ecosystems to function correctly
if we remove this mammal from our ecosystems they simply will not work
thats the first thing
the second thing is that due to the unique sensory abilities of this mammal if we study this mammal were going to get great insight into our diseases of the senses such as blindness and deafness
and the third really intriguing aspect of this mammal is that i fully believe that the secret of everlasting youth lies deep within its dna
so are you all thinking
so magnificent creature isnt it
who here thought of a bat
ah i can see half the audience agrees with me and i have a lot of work to do to convince the rest of you
so i have had the good fortune for the past years to study these fascinating and beautiful mammals
one fifth of all living mammals is a bat and they have very unique attributes
bats as we know them have been around on this planet for about million years
one of the most unique things that bats do as a mammal is that they fly
now flight is an inherently difficult thing
flight within vertebrates has only evolved three times once in the bats once in the birds and once in the pterodactyls
and so with flight its very metabolically costly
bats have learned and evolved how to deal with this
but one other extremely unique thing about bats is that they are able to use sound to perceive their environment they use echolocation
now what i mean by echolocation they emit a sound from their larynx out through their mouth or through their nose this sound wave comes out and it reflects and echoes back off objects in their environment and the bats then hear these echoes and they turn this information into an acoustic image
and this enables them to orient in complete darkness
indeed they do look very strange were humans
were a visual species when scientists first realized that bats were actually using sound to be able to fly and orient and move at night we didnt believe it
for a hundred years despite evidence to show that this is what they were doing we didnt believe it
now if you look at this bat it looks a little bit alien
indeed the very famous philosopher thomas nagel once said to truly experience an alien life form on this planet you should lock yourself inside a room with a flying echolocating bat in complete darkness
and if you look at the actual physical characteristics on the face of this beautiful horseshoe bat you see a lot of these characteristics are dedicated to be able to make sound and perceive it
very big ears strange nose leaves but teeny tiny eyes
so again if you just look at this bat you realize sound is very important for its survival
most bats look like the previous one
however there are a group that do not use echolocation
they do not perceive their environment using sound and these are the flying foxes
if anybody has ever been lucky enough to be in australia youve seen them coming out of the botanic gardens in sydney and if you just look at their face you can see they have much much larger eyes and much smaller ears
so among and within bats is a huge variation in their ability to use sensory perception
now this is going to be important for what im going to tell you later during the talk
now if the idea of bats in your belfry terrifies you and i know some people probably are feeling a little sick looking at very large images of bats thats probably not that surprising because here in western culture bats have been demonized
really of course the famous book dracula written by a fellow northside dubliner bram stoker probably is mainly responsible for this
however i also think its got to do with the fact that bats come out at night and we dont really understand them were a little frightened by things that can perceive the world slightly differently than us
bats are usually synonymous with some type of evil events
they are the perpetrators in horror movies such as this famous nightwing
also if you think about it demons always have bat wings whereas birds they typically or angels have bird wings
now this is western society and what i hope to do tonight is to convince you of the chinese traditional culture that they perceive bats as creatures that bring good luck and indeed if you walk into a chinese home you may see an image such as this
this is considered the five blessings
the chinese word for bat sounds like the chinese word for happiness and they believe that bats bring wealth health longevity virtue and serenity
and indeed in this image you have a picture of longevity surrounded by five bats
and what i want to do tonight is to talk to you and to show you that at least three of these blessings are definitely represented by a bat and that if we study bats we will get nearer to getting each of these blessings
so wealth how can a bat possibly bring us wealth
now as i said before bats are essential for our ecosystems to function correctly and why is this
bats in the tropics are major pollinators of many plants
they also feed on fruit and they disperse the seeds of these fruits bats are responsible for pollinating the tequila plant and this is a multi million dollar industry in mexico so indeed we need them for our ecosystems to function properly
without them its going to be a problem
but most bats are voracious insect predators
its been estimated in the u s in a tiny colony of big brown bats that they will feed on over a million insects a year and in the united states of america right now bats are being threatened by a disease known as white nose syndrome
its working its way slowly across the u s and wiping out populations of bats and scientists have estimated that metric tons of insects a year are now remaining in the ecosystems due to the loss of bats
bats are also threatened in the u s
by their attraction to wind farms again right now bats are looking at a little bit of a problem
theyre going to they are very threatened in the united states of america alone
now how can this help us
well it has been calculated that if we were to remove bats from the equation were going to have to then use insecticides to remove all those pest insects that feed on our agricultural crops
and for one year in the u s alone its estimated that its going to cost billion u s dollars if we remove bats so indeed bats then do bring us wealth
they maintain the health of our ecosystems and also they save us money
so again thats the first blessing bats are important for our ecosystems
and what about the second what about health
inside every cell in your body lies your genome
your genome is made up of your dna your dna codes for proteins that enable you to function and interact and be as you are
now since the new advancements in modern molecular technologies it is now possible for us to sequence our own genome in a very rapid time and at a very very reduced cost
now when weve been doing this weve realized that theres variations within our genome
so i want you to look at the person beside you
just have a quick look and what we need to realize is that every base pairs in your dna youre a little bit different
and one of the grand challenges right now in modern molecular medicine is to work out whether this variation makes you more susceptible to diseases or does this variation just make you different
again what does it mean here what does this variation actually mean so if we are to capitalize on all of this new molecular data and personalized genomic information that is coming online that we will be able to have in the next few years we have to be able to differentiate between the two so how do we do this
well i believe we just look at natures experiments
so through natural selection over time mutations variations that disrupt the function of a protein will not be tolerated over time
evolution acts as a sieve it sieves out the bad variation
and so therefore if you look at the same region of a genome in many mammals that have been evolutionarily distant from each other and are also ecologically divergent you will get a better understanding of what the evolutionary prior of that site is i e if it is important for the mammal to function for its survival it will be the same in all of those different lineages species taxa
so therefore if we were to do this what wed need to do is sequence that region in all these different mammals and ascertain if its the same or if its different so if it is the same this indicates that that site is important for a function so a disease mutation should fall within that site
so in this case here if all the mammals that we look at have a yellow type genome at that site it probably suggests that purple is bad
this could be even more powerful if you look at mammals that are doing things slightly differently
so say for example the region of the genome that i was looking at was a region thats important for vision
if we look at that region in mammals that dont see so well such as bats and we find that bats that dont see so well have the purple type we know that this is probably whats causing this disease
so in my lab weve been using bats to look at two different types of diseases of the senses
were looking at blindness now why would you do this
three hundred and fourteen million people are visually impaired and million of these are blind so blindness is a big problem and a lot of these blind disorders come from inherited diseases so we want to try and better understand which mutations in the gene cause the disease
also we look at deafness one in every newborn babies are deaf and when we reach over half of us will also have a hearing problem
again theres many underlying genetic causes for this
is looking at these unique sensory specialists the bats and we have looked at genes that cause blindness when theres a defect in them genes that cause deafness when theres a defect in them and now we can predict which sites are most likely to cause disease
so bats are also important for our health to enable us to better understand how our genome functions
so this is where we are right now but what about the future
what about longevity
this is where were going to go and as i said before i really believe that the secret of everlasting youth lies within the bat genome
so why should we be interested in aging at all
well really this is a picture drawn from the of the fountain of youth aging is considered one of the most familiar yet the least well understood aspects of all of biology and really since the dawn of civilization mankind has sought to avoid it
but we are going to have to understand it a bit better
in europe alone by there is going to be a percent increase of individuals over and percent increase in individuals over
as we age we deteriorate and this deterioration causes problems for our society so we have to address it
so how could the secret of everlasting youth actually lie within the bat genome does anybody want to hazard a guess over how long this bat could live for
who put up your hands who says two years
nobody one how about years
some how about
how about okay its a whole varied response
this bat is myotis brandtii its the longest living bat
it lived for up to years and this bats still alive in the wild today
but what would be so amazing about this
well typically in mammals there is a relationship between body size metabolic rate and how long you can live for and you can predict how long a mammal can live for given its body size
so typically small mammals live fast die young
think of a mouse but bats are very different
as you can see here on this graph in blue these are all other mammals but bats can live up to nine times longer than expected despite having a really really high metabolic rate and the question is how can they do that
there are species of mammal that live longer than expected given their body size than man and of those are bats
so therefore they must have something within their dna that ables them to deal with the metabolic stresses particularly of flight they expend three times more energy than a mammal of the same size but dont seem to suffer the consequences or the effects
so right now in my lab were combining state of the art bat field biology going out and catching the long lived bats with the most up to date modern molecular technology to understand better what it is that they do to stop aging as we do
and hopefully in the next five years ill be giving you a tedtalk on that
aging is a big problem for humanity and i believe that by studying bats we can uncover the molecular mechanisms that enable mammals to achieve extraordinary longevity if we find out what theyre doing perhaps through gene therapy we can enable us to do the same thing
potentially this means that we could halt aging or maybe even reverse it
just imagine what that would be like
so really i dont think we should be thinking of them as flying demons of the night but more as our superheroes
and the reality is that bats can bring us so much benefit if we just look in the right place theyre good for our ecosystem they allow us to understand how our genome functions and they potentially hold the secret to everlasting youth
so tonight when you walk out of here and you look up in the night skies and you see this beautiful flying mammal i want you to smile thank you

description ted talk subtitles and transcript how many poets could cram ebay friendster and monster com into minute poem worthy of a standing ovation enjoy rives unique talent description
i wrote this poem after hearing a pretty well known actress tell a very well known interviewer on television im really getting into the internet lately
i just wish it were more organized
so
if i controlled the internet you could auction your broken heart on ebay
take the money go to amazon buy a phonebook for a country youve never been to call folks at random until you find someone who flirts really well in a foreign language
if i were in charge of the internet you could mapquest your lovers mood swings
hang left at cranky right at preoccupied u turn on silent treatment all the way back to tongue kissing and good lovin
you could navigate and understand every emotional intersection
some days im as shallow as a baking pan but i still stretch miles in all directions
if i owned the internet napster monster and friendster com would be one big website
that way you could listen to cool music while you pretend to look for a job and youre really just chattin with your pals
heck if i ran the web you could email dead people
they would not email you back but youd get an automated reply
their name in your inbox its all you wanted anyway
and a message saying hey its me i miss you
listen youll see being dead is dandy
now you go back to raising kids and waging peace and craving candy
if i designed the internet childhood com would be a loop of a boy in an orchard with a ski pole for a sword trashcan lid for a shield shouting i am the emperor of oranges
i am the emperor of oranges i am the emperor of oranges
now follow me ok
grandma com would be a recipe for biscuits and spit bath instructions
one two three
that links with hotdiggitydog com
that is my grandfather
they take you to gruff ex cop on his fourth marriage dad
he forms an attachment to kind of ditzy but still sends ginger snaps for christmas mom who downloads the boy in the orchard the emperor of oranges who grows up to be me the guy who usually goes too far
so if i were emperor of the internet i guess id still be mortal huh
but at that point i would probably already have the lowest possible mortgage and the most enlarged possible penis so i would outlaw spam on my first day in office
i wouldnt need it
id be like some kind of internet genius and me id like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that pop id go wireless
huh maybe google would hire this
i could zip through your servers and firewalls like a virus until the world wide web is as wise as wild and as organized as i think a modern day miracle oracle can get but ooh eee you want to bet just how whack and un pc your mac or pc is going to be when im rocking hot shit hot shot god net
i guess its just like life
it is not a question of if you can its do ya
we can interfere with the interface
we can make youve got hallelujah the national anthem of cyberspace every lucky time we log on
you dont say a prayer
you dont write a psalm
you dont chant an om
you send one blessed email to whomever youre thinking of at dah da la dat da dah da la dat com

can geographic information make you healthy
in i got hit by a train
my train was a heart attack
i found myself in a hospital in an intensive care ward recuperating from emergency surgery
and i suddenly realized something that i was completely in the dark
i started asking my questions well why me
why now why here
could my doctor have warned me
so what i want to do here in the few minutes i have with you is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health
genetics lifestyle and environment
thats going to sort of contain our risks and if we manage those risks were going to live a good life and a good healthy life
well i understand the genetics and lifestyle part
and you know why i understand that
because my physicians constantly ask me questions about this
have you ever had to fill out those long legal size forms in your doctors office
i mean if youre lucky enough you get to do it more than once right
do it over and over again and they ask you questions about your lifestyle and your family history your medication history your surgical history your allergy history did i forget any history
but this part of the equation i didnt really get and i dont think my physicians really get this part of the equation
what does that mean my environment
well it can mean a lot of things
this is my life these are my life places
we all have these
while im talking id like you to also be thinking about how many places have you lived
just think about that you know wander through your life thinking about this
and you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places
you spend it at rest and you spend it at work
and if youre like me youre in an airplane a good portion of your time traveling some place
so its not really simple when somebody asks you where do you live where do you work and where do you spend all your time
and where do you expose yourselves to risks that maybe perhaps you dont even see
well when i have done this on myself i always come to the conclusion that i spend about percent of my time relatively in a small number of places
and i dont wander far from that place for a majority of my time even though im an extensive global trekker
now im going to take you on a little journey here
i started off in scranton pennsylvania
i dont know if anybody might hail from northeastern pennsylvania but this is where i spent my first years with my little young lungs
you know breathing high concentrations here of sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide and methane gas in unequal quantities years of this
and if youve been in that part of the country this is what those piles of burning smoldering coal waste look like
so then i decided to leave that part of the world and i was going to go to the mid west
ok so i ended up in louisville kentucky
well i decided to be neighbors to a place called rubbertown
they manufacture plastics they use large quantities chloroprene and benzene
okay i spent years in my middle age lungs now breathing various concentrations of that
and on a clear day it always looked like this so you never saw it
it was insidious and it was really happening
then i decided i had to get really smart i would take this job in the west coast
and i moved to redlands california
very nice and there my older senior lungs as i like to call them i filled with particulate matter carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone
okay almost like the highest in the nation
alright this is what it looks like on a good day
if youve been there you know what im talking about
so whats wrong with this picture
well the picture is there is a huge gap here
the one thing that never happens in my doctors office they never ask me about my place history
no doctor can i remember ever asking me where have you lived
they havent asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that i put in my mouth or the food that i ingest into my stomach
they really dont do that its missing
look at the kind of data thats available
this datas from all over the world countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research
now ive circled the places where ive been
well by design if i wanted to have a heart attack id been in the right places right
so how many people are in the white
how many people in the room have spent the majority of their life in the white space
anybody boy youre lucky
how many have spent it in the red places
oh not so lucky
there are thousands of these kinds of maps that are displayed in atlases all over the world
they give us some sense of whats going to be our train wreck
but none of thats in my medical record
and its not in yours either
so heres my friend paul
hes a colleague he allowed his cell phone to be tracked every two hours days out of the year for the last two years everywhere he went
and you can see hes been to a few places around the united states
and this is where he has spent most of his time
if you really studied that you might have some clues as to what paul likes to do
anybody got any clues ski right
we can zoom in here and we suddenly see that now we see where paul has really spent a majority of his time
and all of those black dots are all of the toxic release inventories that are monitored by the epa
did you know that data existed
for every community in the united states you could have your own personalized map of that
so our cell phones can now build a place history
this is how paul did it he did it with his iphone
this might be what we end up with
this is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room instead of just the pink slip that said i paid at the counter right
this could be my little assessment
and he looks at that and he says whoa bill i suggest that maybe you not decide just because youre out here in beautiful california and its warm every day that you get out and run at six oclock at night
id suggest that thats a bad idea bill because of this report
what id like to leave you for are two prescriptions
okay number one is we must teach physicians about the value of geographical information
its called geomedicine there are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now that are focused on this
and theyre in the early stages of development
these programs need to be supported and we need to teach our future doctors of the world the importance of some of the information ive shared here with you today
the second thing we need to do is while were spending billions and billions of dollars all over the world building an electronic health record we make sure we put a place history inside that medical record
it not only will be important for the physician it will be important for the researchers that now will have huge samples to draw upon
but it will also be useful for us
i could have made the decision if i had this information not to move to the ozone capital of the united states couldnt i i could make that decision
or i could negotiate with my employer to make that decision in the best interest of myself and my company
with that i would like to just say that jack lord said this almost years ago
just look at that for a minute
that was what the conclusion of the dartmouth atlas of healthcare was about was saying that we can explain the geographic variations that occur in disease in illness in wellness and how our healthcare system actually operates
that was what he was talking about on that quote
and i would say he got it right almost a decade ago
so id very much like to see us begin to really seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records
so with that ill leave you that in my particular view of view of health geography always matters
and i believe that geographic information can make both you and me very healthy thank you

title jamie heywood the big idea my brother inspired title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript when jamie heywoods brother was diagnosed with als he devoted his life to fighting the disease as well the heywood brothers built an ingenious website where people share and track data on their illnesses and they discovered that the collective data had enormous power to comfort explain and predict description
when my brother called me in december of he said the news does not look good
this is him on the screen
hed just been diagnosed with als which is a disease that the average lifespan is three years
it paralyzes you it starts by killing the motor neurons in your spinal cord
and you go from being a healthy robust year old male to someone that cannot breathe cannot move cannot speak
this has actually been to me a gift because we began a journey to learn a new way of thinking about life
and even though steven passed away three years ago we had an amazing journey as a family
we did not even i think adversity is not even the right word
we looked at this and we said were going to do something with this in an incredibly positive way
and i want to talk today about one of the things that we decided to do which was to think about a new way of approaching healthcare
because as we all know here today it doesnt work very well
i want to talk about it in the context of a story
this is the story of my brother
but its just a story and i want to go beyond the story and go to something more
given my status what is the best outcome i can hope to achieve and how do i get there
is what we are here to do in medicine is what everyone should do
and those questions all have variables to them
all of our statuses are different
all of our hopes and dreams what we want to accomplish is different and our paths will be different they are all stories
but its a story until we convert it to data and so what we do this concept we had was to take stevens status what is my status
and go from this concept of walking breathing and then his hands speak and ultimately happiness and function
so the first set of pathologies they end up in the stick man on his icon but the rest of them are really whats important here
because steven despite the fact that he was paralyzed as he was in that pool he could not walk he could not use his arms thats why he had the little floaty things on them did you see those he was happy we were at the beach he was raising his son and he was productive
and we took this and we converted it into data
but its not a data point at that one moment in time
it is a data point of steven in a context
here he is in the pool but here he is healthy as a builder taller stronger got all the women amazing guy
here he is walking down the aisle but he can barely walk now so its impaired
and he could still hold his wifes hand but he couldnt do buttons on his clothes cant feed himself
and here he is paralyzed completely unable to breathe and move over this time journey
these stories of his life converted to data
he renovated my carriage house when he was completely paralyzed and unable to speak and unable to breathe and he won an award for a historic restoration
so heres steven alone sharing this story in the world
and this is the insight the thing that we are excited about because we have gone away from the community that we are the fact that we really do love each other and want to care for each other
we need to give to others to be successful
so steven is sharing this story but he is not alone
there are so many other people sharing their stories
not stories in words but stories in data and words
and we convert that information into this structure this understanding this ability to convert those stories into something that is computable to which we can begin to change the way medicine is done and delivered
we did this for als we can do this for depression parkinsons disease hiv
these are not simple they are not internet scalable they require thought and processes to find the meaningful information about the disease
so this is what it looks like when you go to the website
and im going to show you what patients like me the company that myself my youngest brother and a good friend from mit started
here are the actual patients there are of them now sharing their stories as data
here is an m s patient
his name is mike and he is uniformly impaired on cognition vision walking sensation
those are things that are different for each m s patient
each of them can have a different characteristic
you can see fibromyalgia hiv als depression
look at this hiv patient down here zinny
its two years of this disease all of the symptoms are not there
but he is working to keep his count high and his viral level low so he can make his life better
but you can aggregate this and you can discover things about treatments
look at this people almost on copaxone
these are patients currently on drugs sharing data
i love some of these physical exercise prayer
anyone want to run a comparative effectiveness study on prayer against something lets look at prayer
what i love about this just sort of interesting design problems
these are why people pray
here is the schedule of how frequently they its a dose
so anyone want to see the patients that pray for minutes a day and see if theyre doing better they probably are
here they are its an open network everybody is sharing we can see it all
or i want to look at anxiety because people are praying for anxiety
and here is data on peoples current anxiety right now
how they treat it the drugs the components of it their side effects all of it in a rich environment and you can drill down and see the individuals
this amazing data allows us to drill down and see what this drug is for people on this drug i think yes
i want to talk to the patients down here who are taking four milligrams a day
and i want to talk to the ones of those that have been doing it for more than two years
so you can see the duration
all open all available
im going to log in
and this is my brothers profile
and this is a new version of our platform were launching right now
this is the second generation its going to be in flash
and you can see here as this animates over stevens actual data against the background of all other patients against this information
the blue band is the percentile steven is the percentile that he has non genetic als
you scroll down in this profile and you can see all of his prescription drugs but more than that in the new version i can look at this interactively
wait poor spinal capacity
doesnt this remind you of a great stock program
wouldnt it be great if the technology we used to take care of ourselves was as good as the technology we use to make money
detrol in the side effects for his drug integrated into that the stem cell transplant that he had the first in the world shared openly for anyone who wants to see it
i love here the cyberkinetics implant which was again the only patients data that was online and available
you can adjust the time scale you can adjust the symptoms
you can look at the interaction between how i treat my als
so you click down on the als tab there
im taking three drugs to manage it some of them are experimental
i can look at my constipation how to manage it
i can see magnesium citrate and the side effects from that drug all integrated in the time in which theyre meaningful
but i want more
i dont want to just look at this cool device i want to take this data and make something even better
i want my brothers center of the universe and his symptoms and his drugs and all of the things that interact among those the side effects to be in this beautiful data galaxy that we can look at in any way we want to understand it so that we can take this information and go beyond just this simple model of what a record is
i dont even know what a medical record is
i want to solve a problem i want an application
so can i take this data rearrange yourself put the symptoms in the left the drugs across the top tell me everything we know about steven and everyone else and what interacts
years after hes had these drugs i learned that everything he did to manage his excess saliva including some positive side effects that came from other drugs were making his constipation worse
and if anyones ever had severe constipation and you dont understand how much of an impact that has on your life yes that was a pun
youre trying to manage these and this grid is available here and we want to understand it
no ones ever had this kind of information
so patients have this were for patients
this is all about patient health care there was no doctors on our network
this is about the patients
so how can we take this and bring them a tool that they can go back and they can engage the medical system
and we worked hard and we thought about it and we said whats something we can use all the time that we can use in the medical care system that everyone will understand
so the patients print it out because hospitals usually block us because they believe we are a social network
its actually the most used feature on the website
doctors actually love this sheet and theyre actually really engaged
so we went from this story of steven and his history to data and then back to paper where we went back and engaged the medical care system
and heres another paper
this is a journal pnas i think its the proceedings of the national academy of science of the united states of america
youve seen multiple of these today when everyones bragging about the amazing things theyve done
this is a report about a drug called lithium
lithium that is a drug used to treat bipolar disorder that a group in italy found slowed als down in patients and published it
now well skip the critiques of the paper
but the short story is if youre a patient you want to be on the blue line
you dont want to be on the red line you want to be on the blue line
because the blue line is a better line the red line is way downhill the blue line is a good line
so you know we said we looked at this and what i love also is that people always accuse these internet sites of promoting bad medicine and having people do things irresponsibly
so this is what happened when pnas published this
ten percent of the people in our system took lithium
ten percent of the patients started taking lithium based on patients of data in a bad publication
and they call the internet irresponsible
heres the implication of what happens
theres this one guy named humberto from brazil who unfortunately passed away nine months ago who said hey listen can you help us answer this question
because i dont want to wait for the next trial its going to be years
i want to know now can you help us
so we launched some tools we let them track their blood levels
we let them share the data and exchange it
you know a data network
and they said you know jamie plm can you guys tell us whether this works or not
and we went around and we talked to people and they said you cant run a clinical trial like this you know
you dont have the blinding you dont have data it doesnt follow the scientific method
its never going to work you cant do it
so i said okay well we cant do that then we can do something harder
i cant say whether lithium works in all als patients but i can say whether it works in humberto
i bought a mac about two years ago i converted over and i was so excited about this new feature of the time machine that came in leopard and we said because its really cool you can go back and you can look at the entire history of your computer and find everything youve lost and i loved it
and i said what if we built a time machine for patients except instead of going backwards we go forwards
can we find out whats going to happen to you so that you can maybe change it
so we did we took all the patients like humberto thats the apple background we stole that because we didnt have time to build our own this is a real app by the way
this is not just graphics
and you take those data and we find the patients like him and we bring their data together and we bring their histories into it
and then we say well how do we line them all up
so we line them all up so they go together around the meaningful points integrated across everything we know about the patient
full information the entire course of their disease
and thats what is going to happen to humberto unless he does something
and he took lithium and he went down the line
and it works almost every time
now the ones that it doesnt work are interesting
but almost all the time it works
its actually scary its beautiful
so we couldnt run a clinical trial we couldnt figure it out
but we could see whether it was going to work for humberto
and yeah all the clinicians in the audience will talk about power and all the standard deviation well do that later
but here is the answer of the mean of the patients that actually decided to take lithium
these are all the patients that started lithium
its the intent to treat curve
you can see here the blue dots on the top the light ones those are the people in the study in pnas that you wanted to be on and the red ones are the ones the pink ones on the bottom are the ones you didnt want to be
and the ones in the middle are all of our patients from the start of lithium at time zero going forward and then going backward
so you can see we matched them perfectly perfectly
terrifyingly accurate matching
and going forward you actually dont want to be a lithium patient this time
youre actually doing slightly worse not significantly but slightly worse you dont want to be a lithium patient this time
but you know a lot of people dropped out the trial there is too much drop out
can we do the even harder thing can we go to the patients that actually decided to stay on lithium because they were so convinced they were getting better
we asked our control algorithm are those patients by the way youll notice thats four times the number of patients in the clinical trial can we look at those patients and say can we match them with our time machine to the other patients that are just like them and what happens
even the ones that believed they were getting better matched the controls exactly exactly
those little lines thats the power
so we i cant tell you lithium doesnt work i cant tell you that if you did it at a higher dose or if you run the study proper i can tell you that for those people that took lithium they didnt do any better than the people that were just like them just like me and that we had the power to detect that at about a quarter of the strengths reported in the initial study
we did that one year ahead of the time when the first clinical trial funded by the nih for millions of dollars failed for futility last week and announced it
so remember i told you about my brothers stem cell transplant
i never really knew whether it worked
and i put million cells in his cisterna magna in his lumbar cord and filled out the irbs and did all this work and i never really knew
how did i not know
i mean i didnt know what was going to happen to him
i actually asked tim who is the quant in our group we actually searched for about a year to find someone who could do the sort of math and statistics and modeling in healthcare couldnt find anybody so we went to the finance industry
and there are these guys who used to model the future of interest rates and all that kind of stuff
and some of them were available so we hired one
we hired them set them up assisting at lab
i i m him things thats the way i communicate with him is like a little guy in a box i i m ed tim i said tim can you tell me whether my brothers stem cell transplant worked or not
and he sent me this two days ago
it was that little outliers there you see that guy that lived a long time
we have to go talk to him because id like to know what happened
because something went different
but my brother didnt my brother went straight down the line
it only works about months
its the first version of the time machine
first time we ever tried it well try to get it better later but months so far
and you know i look at this and i get really emotional
you look at the patients you can drill in all the controls you can look at them you can ask them
and i found a woman that had we found her she was odd because she had data after she died
and her husband had come in and entered her last functional scores because he knew how much she cared
and i am thankful
i cant believe that these people years after my brother had died helped me answer the question about whether an operation i did and spent millions of dollars on years ago worked or not
i wished it had been there when id done it the first time and im really excited that its here now because the lab that i founded has some data on a drug that might work and id like to show it
id like to show it in real time now and i want to do that for all of the diseases that we can do that for
ive got to thank the people that are doing this social experiment with us
there is an amazing journey we are going on to become human again to be part of community again to share of ourselves to be vulnerable and its very exciting so thank you

title kirby ferguson embrace the remix title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript nothing is original says kirby ferguson creator of everything is a remix from bob dylan to steve jobs he says our most celebrated creators borrow steal and transform description
were going to begin in
bob dylan is years old and his career is just reaching its pinnacle
hes been christened the voice of a generation and hes churning out classic songs at a seemingly impossible rate but theres a small minority of dissenters and they claim that bob dylan is stealing other peoples songs
brian burton aka danger mouse takes the beatles white album combines it with jay zs the black album to create the grey album
the grey album becomes an immediate sensation online and the beatles record company sends out countless cease and desist letters for unfair competition and dilution of our valuable property
now the grey album is a remix
it is new media created from old media
it was made using these three techniques copy transform and combine
its how you remix you take existing songs you chop them up you transform the pieces you combine them back together again and youve got a new song but that new song is clearly comprised of old songs
but i think these arent just the components of remixing
i think these are the basic elements of all creativity
i think everything is a remix and i think this is a better way to conceive of creativity
all right lets head back to and lets hear where some of dylans early songs came from
well do some side by side comparisons here
all right this first song youre going to hear is nottamun town its a traditional folk tune
after that youll hear dylans masters of war
jean ritchie ♫ in nottamun town not a soul would look out ♫ ♫ not a soul would look up not a soul would look down ♫ bob dylan ♫ come you masters of war ♫ ♫ you that build the big guns you that build the death planes ♫ ♫ you that build all the bombs ♫ kirby ferguson okay so thats the same basic melody and overall structure this next one is the patriot game by dominic behan alongside that youre going to hear with god on our side by dylan
dominic behan ♫ come all ye young rebels ♫ ♫ and list while i sing ♫ ♫ for the love of ones land is a terrible thing ♫ bd ♫ oh my name it is nothin ♫ ♫ my age it means less ♫ ♫ the country i come from is called the midwest ♫ kf okay so in this case dylan admits he must have heard the patriot game he forgot about it then when the song kind of bubbled back up in his brain he just thought it was his song
last one this is whos going to buy you ribbons another traditional folk tune
alongside that is dont think twice its all right
this ones more about the lyric
paul clayton ♫ it aint no use to sit and sigh now ♫ ♫ darlin and it aint no use to sit and cry now ♫ bd ♫ it ain t no use to sit and wonder why babe ♫ ♫ if you dont know by now ♫ ♫ and it aint no use to sit and wonder why babe ♫ ♫ itll never do somehow ♫ kf okay now theres a lot of these
its been estimated that two thirds of the melodies dylan used in his early songs were borrowed
this is pretty typical among folk singers
heres the advice of dylans idol woody guthrie
the worlds are the important thing
dont worry about tunes take a tune sing high when they sing low sing fast when they sing slow and youve got a new tune
and thats thats what guthrie did right here and im sure you all recognize the results
we know this tune right we know it
actually you dont
that is when the worlds on fire a very old melody in this case performed by the carter family
guthrie adapted it into this land is your land
so bob dylan like all folk singers he copied melodies he transformed them he combined them with new lyrics which were frequently their own concoction of previous stuff
now american copyright and patent laws run counter to this notion that we build on the work of others
instead these laws and laws around the world use the rather awkward analogy of property
now creative works may indeed be kind of like property but its property that were all building on and creations can only take root and grow once that ground has been prepared
henry ford once said i invented nothing new
i simply assembled the discoveries of other men behind whom were centuries of work
progress happens when all the factors that make for it are ready and then it is inevitable
the iphone makes it debut
apple undoubtedly brings this innovation to us early but its time was approaching because its core technology had been evolving for decades
thats multi touch controlling a device by touching its display
here is steve jobs introducing multi touch and making a rather foreboding joke
steve jobs and we have invented a new technology called multi touch
you can do multi fingered gestures on it and boy have we patented it
kf yes and yet here is multi touch in action
this is at ted actually about a year earlier
this is jeff han and i mean thats multi touch
its the same animal at least
lets hear what jeff han has to say about this newfangled technology
jeff han multi touch sensing isnt anything isnt completely new i mean people like bill buxton have been playing around with it in the
the technology you know isnt the most exciting thing here right now other than probably its newfound accessibility
kf so hes pretty frank about it not being new
so its not multi touch as a whole thats patented
its the small parts of it that are and its in these small details where we can clearly see patent law contradicting its intent to promote the progress of useful arts
here is the first ever slide to unlock
that is all there is to it apple has patented this
its a page software patent but i will summarize what it covers spoiler alert unlocking your phone by sliding an icon with your finger
im only exaggerating a little bit its a broad patent
now can someone own this idea
now back in the there were no software patents and it was xerox that pioneered the graphical user interface
what if they had patented pop up menus scrollbars the desktop with icons that look like folders and sheets of paper
would a young and inexperienced apple have survived the legal assault from a much larger and more mature company like xerox
now this idea that everything is a remix might sound like common sense until youre the one getting remixed
for example
sj i mean picasso had a saying
he said good artists copy great artists steal
and we have you know always been shameless about stealing great ideas
kf okay so thats in heres in
im going to destroy android because its a stolen product
im willing to go thermonuclear war on this
okay so in other words great artists steal but not from me
now behavioral economists might refer to this sort of thing as loss aversion we have a strong predisposition towards protecting what we feel is ours
we have no such aversion towards copying what other people have because we do that nonstop
so heres the sort of equation were looking at
weve got laws that fundamentally treat creative works as property plus massive rewards or settlements in infringement cases plus huge legal fees to protect yourself in court plus cognitive biases against perceived loss
and the sum looks like this
that is the last four years of lawsuits in the realm of smartphones
is this promoting the progress of useful arts
bob dylan is years old and his time in the cultural spotlight is long since past
he records a song called blind willie mctell named after the blues singer and the song is a voyage through the past through a much darker time but a simpler one a time when musicians like willie mctell had few illusions about what they did
i jump em from other writers but i arrange em my own way
i think this is mostly what we do
our creativity comes from without not from within
we are not self made we are dependent on one another and admitting this to ourselves isnt an embrace of mediocrity and derivativeness
its a liberation from our misconceptions and its an incentive to not expect so much from ourselves and to simply begin
thank you so much it was an honor to be here
thank you
thank you thank you
thank you

title gary wolf the quantified self title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript at ted cannes gary wolf gives a min intro to an intriguing new pastime using mobile apps and always on gadgets to track and analyze your body mood diet spending just about everything in daily life you can measure in gloriously geeky detail description
i got up this morning at a m
after going to sleep at a m
i was awakened once during the night
my heart rate was beats per minute my blood pressure over
i had zero minutes of exercise yesterday so my maximum heart rate during exercise wasnt calculated
i had about milligrams of caffeine zero of alcohol
and my score on the narcissism personality index or the npi is a reassuring
we know that numbers are useful for us when we advertise manage govern search
im going to talk about how theyre useful when we reflect learn remember and want to improve
a few years ago kevin kelly my partner and i noticed that people were subjecting themselves to regimes of quantitative measurement and self tracking that went far beyond the ordinary familiar habits such as stepping on a scale every day
people were tracking their food via twitter their kids diapers on their iphone
they were making detailed journals of their spending their mood their symptoms their treatments
now we know some of the technological facts that are driving this change in our lifestyle the uptake and diffusion of mobile devices the exponential improvement in data storage and data processing and the remarkable improvement in human biometric sensors
this little black dot there is a accelerometer
it tracks your movement through space
it is as you can see very small and also very cheap
theyre now down to well under a dollar a piece and theyre going into all kinds of devices
but whats interesting is the incredible detailed information that you can get from just one sensor like this
this kind of sensor is in the hit biometric device among early adopters at the moment the fitbit
this tracks your activity and also your sleep
it has just that sensor in it
youre probably familiar with the nike system
i just put it up because that little blue dot is the sensor
its really just a pressure sensor like the kind thats in a doorbell
and nike knows how to get your pace and distance from just that sensor
this is the strap that people use to transmit heart rate data to their nike system
this is a beautiful new device that gives you detailed sleep tracking data not just whether youre asleep or awake but also your phase of sleep deep sleep light sleep rem sleep
the sensor is just a little strip of metal in that headband there
the rest of it is the bedside console just for reference this is a sleep tracking system from just a few years ago i mean really until now
and this is the sleep tracking system of today
this just was presented at a health care conference in d c
most of what you see there is an asthma inhaler but the top is a very small gps transceiver which gives you the date and location of an asthma incident giving you a new awareness of your vulnerability in relation to time and environmental factors
now we know that new tools are changing our sense of self in the world these tiny sensors that gather data in nature the ubiquitous computing that allows that data to be understood and used and of course the social networks that allow people to collaborate and contribute
but we think of these tools as pointing outward as windows and id just like to invite you to think of them as also turning inward and becoming mirrors
so that when we think about using them to get some systematic improvement we also think about how they can be useful for self improvement for self discovery self awareness self knowledge
heres a biometric device a pair of apple earbuds
last year apple filed some patents to get blood oxygenation heart rate and body temperature via the earbuds
what is this for
what should it be for
some people will say its for biometric security
some people will say its for public health research
some people will say its for avant garde marketing research
id like to tell you that its also for self knowledge
and the self isnt the only thing its not even most things
the self is just our operation center our consciousness our moral compass
so if we want to act more effectively in the world we have to get to know ourselves better
thank you

title jr my wish use art to turn the world inside out title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript jr a semi anonymous french street artist uses his camera to show the world its true face by pasting photos of the human face across massive canvases at he makes his audacious ted prize wish to use art to turn the world inside out learn more about his work and learn how you can join in at insideoutproject net description
two weeks ago i was in my studio in paris and the phone rang and i heard hey jr you won the ted prize
you have to make a wish to save the world
i was lost
i mean i cant save the world nobody can
the world is fucked up
come on you have dictators ruling the world population is growing by millions theres no more fish in the sea the north pole is melting and as the last ted prize winner said were all becoming fat
except maybe french people
whatever
so i called back and i told her look amy tell the ted guys i just wont show up
i cant do anything to save the world
she said hey jr your wish is not to save the world but to change the world
oh all right
thats cool
i mean technology politics business do change the world not always in a good way but they do
what about art
could art change the world
i started when i was years old
and at that time i was not thinking about changing the world
i was doing graffiti writing my name everywhere using the city as a canvas
i was going in the tunnels of paris on the rooftops with my friends
each trip was an excursion was an adventure
it was like leaving our mark on society to say i was here on the top of a building
so when i found a cheap camera on the subway i started documenting those adventures with my friends and gave them back as photocopies really small photos just that size
thats how at years old i started pasting them
and i did my first expo de rue which means sidewalk gallery
and i framed it with color so you would not confuse it with advertising
i mean the citys the best gallery i could imagine
i would never have to make a book and then present it to a gallery and let them decide if my work was nice enough to show it to people
i would control it directly with the public in the streets
so thats paris
i would change depending on the places i would go the title of the exhibition
thats on the champs elysees
i was quite proud of that one
because i was just and i was just up there on the top of the champs elysees
then when the photo left the frame was still there
november the streets are burning
a large wave of riots had broken into the first projects of paris
everyone was glued to the tv watching disturbing frightening images taken from the edge of the neighborhood
i mean these kids without control throwing molotov cocktails attacking the cops and the firemen looting everything they could in the shops
these were criminals thugs dangerous destroying their own environment
and then i saw it could it be possible my photo on a wall revealed by a burning car a pasting id done a year earlier an illegal one still there
i mean these were the faces of my friends
i know those guys
all of them are not angels but theyre not monsters either
so it was kind of weird to see those images and those eyes stare back at me through a television
so i went back there with a mm lens
it was the only one i had at that time
but with that lens you have to be as close as inches from the person
so you can do it only with their trust
so i took full portraits of people from le bosquet
they were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves
and then i pasted huge posters everywhere in the bourgeois area of paris with the name age even building number of these guys
a year later the exhibition was displayed in front of the city hall of paris
and we go from thug images whove been stolen and distorted by the media whos now proudly taking over his own image
thats where i realized the power of paper and glue
so could art change the world
a year later i was listening to all the noise about the middle east conflict
i mean at that time trust me they were only referring to the israeli and palestinian conflict
so with my friend marco we decided to go there and see who are the real palestinians and who are the real israelis
are they so different
when we got there we just went in the street started talking with people everywhere and we realized that things were a bit different from the rhetoric we heard in the media
so we decided to take portraits of palestinians and israelis doing the same jobs taxi driver lawyer cooks
asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment
not a smile that really doesnt tell about who you are and what you feel
they all accepted to be pasted next to the other
i decided to paste in eight israeli and palestinian cities and on both sides of the wall
we launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever
we called the project face face
the experts said no way
the people will not accept
the army will shoot you and hamas will kidnap you
we said okay lets try and push as far as we can
i love the way that people will ask me how big will my photo be
it will be as big as your house
when we did the wall we did the palestinian side
so we arrived with just our ladders and we realized that they were not high enough
and so palestinians guys say calm down no wait im going to find you a solution
so he went to the church of nativity and brought back an old ladder that was so old that it could have seen jesus being born
we did face face with only six friends two ladders two brushes a rented car a camera and square feet of paper
we had all sorts of help from all walks of life
okay for example thats palestine
were in ramallah right now
were pasting portraits so both portraits in the streets in a crowded market
people come around us and start asking what are you doing here
oh were actually doing an art project and we are pasting an israeli and a palestinian doing the same job
and those ones are actually two taxi drivers
and then there was always a silence
you mean youre pasting an israeli face doing a face right here
well yeah yeah thats part of the project
and i would always leave that moment and we would ask them so can you tell me who is who
and most of them couldnt say
we even pasted on israeli military towers and nothing happened
when you paste an image its just paper and glue
people can tear it tag on it or even pee on it some are a bit high for that i agree but the people in the street they are the curator
the rain and the wind will take them off anyway
they are not meant to stay
but exactly four years after the photos most of them are still there
face face demonstrated that what we thought impossible was possible and you know what even easy
we didnt push the limit we just showed that they were further than anyone thought
in the middle east i experienced my work in places without museums
so the reactions in the street were kind of interesting
so i decided to go further in this direction and go in places where there were zero museums
when you go in these developing societies women are the pillars of their community but the men are still the ones holding the streets
so we were inspired to create a project where men will pay tribute to women by posting their photos
i called that project women are heroes
when i listened to all the stories everywhere i went on the continents i couldnt always understand the complicated circumstances of their conflict
i just observed
sometimes there was no words no sentence just tears
i just took their pictures and pasted them
women are heroes took me around the world
most of the places i went to i decided to go there because ive heard about it through the media
so for example in june i was watching tv in paris and then i heard about this terrible thing that happened in rio de janeiro the first favela of brazil named providencia
three kids that was three students were by the army because they were not carrying their papers
and the army took them and instead of bringing them to the police station they brought them to an enemy favela where they get chopped into pieces
i was shocked
all brazil was shocked
i heard it was one of the most violent favelas because the largest drug cartel controls it
so i decided to go there
when i arrived i mean i didnt have any contact with any ngo
there was none in place no association no ngos nothing no eyewitnesses
so we just walked around and we met a woman and i showed her my book
and she said you know what
were hungry for culture
we need culture out there
so i went out and i started with the kids
i just took a few photos of the kids and the next day i came with the posters and we pasted them
the day after i came back and they were already scratched
but thats okay
i wanted them to feel that this art belongs to them
then the next day i held a meeting on the main square and some women came
they were all linked to the three kids that got killed
there was the mother the grandmother the best friend they all wanted to shout the story
after that day everyone in the favela gave me the green light
i took more photos and we started the project
the drug lords were kind of worried about us filming in the place so i told them you know what
im not interested in filming the violence and the weapons
you see that enough in the media
what i want to show is the incredible life and energy
ive been seeing it around me the last few days
so thats a really symbolic pasting because thats the first one we did that you couldnt see from the city
and thats where the three kids got arrested and thats the grandmother of one of them
and on that stairs thats where the traffickers always stand and theres a lot of exchange of fire
everyone there understood the project
and then we pasted everywhere the whole hill
what was interesting is that the media couldnt get in
i mean you should see that
they would have to film us from a really long distance by helicopter and then have a really long lens and we would see ourselves on tv pasting
and they would put a number please call this number if you know whats going on in providencia
we just did a project and then left so the media wouldnt know
so how can we know about the project
so they had to go and find the women and get an explanation from them
so you create a bridge between the media and the anonymous women
we kept traveling
we went to africa sudan sierra leone liberia kenya
in war torn places like monrovia people come straight to you
i mean they want to know what youre up to
they kept asking me what is the purpose of your project
are you an ngo are you the media
art just doing art
some people question why is it in black and white
dont you have color in france
or they tell you are these people all dead
some who understood the project would explain it to others
and to a man who did not understand i heard someone say you know youve been here for a few hours trying to understand discussing with your fellows
during that time you havent thought about what youre going to eat tomorrow
this is art
i think its peoples curiosity that motivates them to come into the projects
and then it becomes more
it becomes a desire a need an armor
on this bridge thats in monrovia ex rebel soldiers helped us pasting a portrait of a woman that might have been raped during the war
women are always the first ones targeted during conflict
this is kibera kenya one of the largest slums of africa
you might have seen images about the post election violence that happened there in
this time we covered the roofs of the houses but we didnt use paper because paper doesnt prevent the rain from leaking inside the house vinyl does
then art becomes useful
so the people kept it
you know what i love is for example when you see the biggest eye there there are so houses inside
and i went there a few months ago photos are still there and it was missing a piece of the eye
so i asked the people what happened
oh that guy just moved
when the roofs were covered a woman said as a joke now god can see me
when you look at kibera now they look back
okay india
before i start that just so you know each time we go to a place we dont have authorization so we set up like commandos were a group of friends who arrive there and we try to paste on the walls
but there are places where you just cant paste on a wall
in india it was just impossible to paste
i heard culturally and because of the law they would just arrest us at the first pasting
so we decided to paste white white on the walls
so imagine white guys pasting white papers
so people would come to us and ask us hey what are you up to
oh you know were just doing art art
of course they were confused
but you know how india has a lot of dust in the streets and the more dust you would have going up in the air on the white paper you can almost see but there is this sticky part like when you reverse a sticker
so the more dust you have the more it will reveal the photo
so we could just walk in the street during the next days and the photos would get revealed by themselves
thank you
so we didnt get caught this time
each project thats a film from women are heroes
okay
for each project we do a film
and most of what you see thats a trailer from women are heroes its images photography taken one after the other
and the photos kept traveling even without us
hopefully youll see the film and youll understand the scope of the project and what the people felt when they saw those photos
because thats a big part of it theres layers behind each photo
behind each image is a story
women are heroes created a new dynamic in each of the communities and the women kept that dynamic after we left
for example we did books not for sale that all the community would get
but to get it they would have to it signed by one of the women
we did that in most of the places
we go back regularly
and so in providencia for example in the favela we have a cultural center running there
in kibera each year we cover more roofs
because of course when we left the people who were just at the edge of the project said hey what about my roof
so we decided to come the year after and keep doing the project
a really important point for me is that i dont use any brand or corporate sponsors
so i have no responsibility to anyone but myself and the subjects
and that is for me one of the more important things in the work
i think today as important as the result is the way you do things
and that has always been a central part of the work
and whats interesting is that fine line that i have with images and advertising
we just did some pasting in los angeles on another project in the last weeks
and i was even invited to cover the moca museum
but yesterday the city called them and said look youre going to have to tear it down
because this can be taken for advertising and because of the law it has to be taken down
but tell me advertising for what
the people i photograph were proud to participate in the project and to have their photo in the community
but they asked me for a promise basically
they asked me please make our story travel with you
so i did thats paris
thats rio
in each place we built exhibitions with a story and the story traveled
you understand the full scope of the project
thats london
new york
and today they are with you in long beach
all right recently i started a public art project where i dont use my artwork anymore
i use man ray helen levitt giacomelli other peoples artwork
it doesnt matter today if its your photo or not
the importance is what you do with the images the statement it makes where its pasted
so for example i pasted the photo of the minaret in switzerland a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country
this image of three men wearing gas masks was taken in chernobyl originally and i pasted it in southern italy where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground
in some ways art can change the world
art is not supposed to change the world to change practical things but to change perceptions
art can change the way we see the world
art can create an analogy
actually the fact that art cannot change things makes it a neutral place for exchanges and discussions and then enables you to change the world
when i do my work i have two kinds of reactions
people say oh why dont you go in iraq or afghanistan
they would be really useful
or how can we help
i presume that you belong to the second category and thats good because for that project im going to ask you to take the photos and paste them
so now my wish is i wish for you to stand up for what you care about by participating in a global art project and together well turn the world inside out
and this starts right now
yes everyone in the room
everyone watching
i wanted that wish to actually start now
so a subject youre passionate about a person who you want to tell their story or even your own photos tell me what you stand for
take the photos the portraits upload it ill give you all the details and ill send you back your poster join by groups and reveal things to the world
the full data is on the website insideoutproject net that is launching today
what we see changes who we are
when we act together the whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts
so i hope that together well create something that the world will remember
and this starts right now and depends on you
thank you
thank you

title suzanne lee grow your own clothes title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript designer suzanne lee shares her experiments in growing a kombucha based material that can be used like fabric or vegetable leather to make clothing the process is fascinating the results are beautiful and the potential is simply stunning description
so as a fashion designer ive always tended to think of materials something like this or this or maybe this
but then i met a biologist and now i think of materials like this green tea sugar a few microbes and a little time
im essentially using a kombucha recipe which is a symbiotic mix of bacteria yeasts and other micro organisms which spin cellulose in a fermentation process
over time these tiny threads form in the liquid into layers and produce a mat on the surface
so we start by brewing the tea
i brew up to about liters of tea at a time and then while its still hot add a couple of kilos of sugar
we stir this in until its completely dissolved and then pour it into a growth bath
we need to check that the temperature has cooled to below degrees c
and then were ready to add the living organism
and along with that some acetic acid
and once you get this process going you can actually recycle your previous fermented liquid
we need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth
and i use a heat mat to sit the bath on and a thermostat to regulate it
and actually in hot weather i can just grow it outside
so this is my mini fabric farm
after about three days the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid
so this is telling us that the fermentation is in full swing
and the bacteria are feeding on the sugar nutrients in the liquid
so theyre spinning these tiny nano fibers of pure cellulose
and theyre sticking together forming layers and giving us a sheet on the surface
after about two to three weeks were looking at something which is about an inch in thickness
so the bath on the left is after five days and on the right after
and this is a static culture
you dont have to do anything to it you just literally watch it grow
it doesnt need light
and when its ready to harvest you take it out of the bath and you wash it in cold soapy water
at this point its really heavy
its over percent water so we need to let that evaporate
so i spread it out onto a wooden sheet
again you can do that outside and just let it dry in the air
and as its drying its compressing so what youre left with depending on the recipe is something thats either like a really light weight transparent paper or something which is much more like a flexible vegetable leather
and then you can either cut that out and sew it conventionally or you can use the wet material to form it around a three dimensional shape
and as it evaporates it will knit itself together forming seams
so the color in this jacket is coming purely from green tea
i guess it also looks a little bit like human skin which intrigues me
since its organic im really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals
i can make it change color without using dye by a process of iron oxidation
using fruit and vegetable staining create organic patterning
and using indigo make it anti microbial
and in fact cotton would take up to dips in indigo to achieve a color this dark
and because of the super absorbency of this kind of cellulose it just takes one and a really short one at that
what i cant yet do is make it water resistant
so if i was to walk outside in the rain wearing this dress today i would immediately start to absorb huge amounts of water
the dress would get really heavy and eventually the seams would probably fall apart leaving me feeling rather naked
possibly a good performance piece but definitely not ideal for everyday wear
what im looking for is a way to give the material the qualities that i need
so what i want to do is say to a future bug spin me a thread
align it in this direction
make it hydrophobic
and while youre at it just form it around this shape
bacterial cellulose is actually already being used for wound healing and possibly in the future for biocompatible blood vessels possibly even replacement bone tissue
but with synthetic biology we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium to produce something that gives us the quality quantity and shape of material that we desire
obviously as a designer thats really exciting because then i start to think wow we could actually imagine growing consumable products
what excites me about using microbes is their efficiency
so we only grow what we need
theres no waste
and in fact we could make it from a waste stream so for example a waste sugar stream from a food processing plant
finally at the end of use we could biodegrade it naturally along with your vegetable peelings
what im not suggesting is that microbial cellulose is going to be a replacement for cotton leather or other textile materials
but i do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition to our increasingly precious natural resources
ultimately maybe it wont even be fashion where we see these microbes have their impact
we could for example imagine growing a lamp a chair a car or maybe even a house
so i guess what my question to you is in the future what would you choose to grow
thank you very much
bruno giussani suzanne just a curiosity what youre wearing is not random
this is one of the jackets you grew
sl yes it is
its probably part of the projects still in process because this one is actually biodegrading in front of your eyes
its absorbing my sweat and its feeding on it
bg okay so well let you go and save it and rescue it

title michael pollan a plants eye view title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript what if human consciousness isnt the end all and be all of darwinism what if we are all just pawns in corns clever strategy game to rule the earth author michael pollan asks us to see the world from a plants eye view description
its a simple idea about nature
i want to say a word for nature because we havent talked that much about it the last couple days
i want to say a word for the soil and the bees and the plants and the animals and tell you about a tool a very simple tool that i have found
although its really nothing more than a literary conceit its not a technology
its very powerful for i think changing our relationship to the natural world and to the other species on whom we depend
and that tool is very simply as chris suggested looking at us and the world from the plants or the animals point of view
its not my idea other people have hit on it but ive tried to take it to some new places
let me tell you where i got it
like a lot of my ideas like a lot of the tools i use i found it in the garden im a very devoted gardener
and there was a day about seven years ago i was planting potatoes it was the first week of may this is new england when the apple trees are just vibrating with bloom theyre just white clouds above
i was here planting my chunks cutting up potatoes and planting it and the bees were working on this tree bumblebees just making this thing vibrate
and one of the things i really like about gardening is that it doesnt take all your concentration you really cant get hurt its not like woodworking and you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation
and the question i asked myself that afternoon in the garden working alongside that bumblebee was what did i and that bumblebee have in common
how was our role in this garden similar and different
and i realized we actually had quite a bit in common both of us were disseminating the genes of one species and not another and both of us probably if i can imagine the bees point of view thought we were calling the shots
i had decided what kind of potato i wanted to plant i had picked my yukon gold or yellow finn or whatever it was and i had summoned those genes from a seed catalog across the country brought it and i was planting it
and that bee no doubt assumed that it had decided im going for that apple tree im going for that blossom im going to get the nectar and im going to leave
we have a grammar that suggests thats who we are that we are sovereign subjects in nature the bee as well as me
i plant the potatoes i weed the garden i domesticate the species
but that day it occurred to me what if that grammar is nothing more than a self serving conceit
because of course the bee thinks hes in charge or shes in charge but we know better
we know that whats going on between the bee and that flower is that bee has been cleverly manipulated by that flower
and when i say manipulated im talking about in a darwinian sense right
i mean it has evolved a very specific set of traits color scent flavor pattern that has lured that bee in
and the bee has been cleverly fooled into taking the nectar and also picking up some powder on its leg and going off to the next blossom
the bee is not calling the shots
and i realized then i wasnt either
i had been seduced by that potato and not another into planting its into spreading its genes giving it a little bit more habitat
and thats when i got the idea which was well what would happen if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who are working on us
and agriculture suddenly appeared to me not as an invention not as a human technology but as a co evolutionary development in which a group of very clever species mostly edible grasses had exploited us figured out how to get us to basically deforest the world
the competition of grasses right
and suddenly everything looked different
and suddenly mowing the lawn that day was a completely different experience
i had thought always and in fact had written this in my first book this was a book about gardening that lawns were nature under cultures boot that they were totalitarian landscapes and that when we mowed them we were cruelly suppressing the species and never letting it set seed or die or have sex
and thats what the lawn was
but then i realized no this is exactly what the grasses want us to do
im a dupe im a dupe of the lawns whose goal in life is to outcompete the trees who they compete with for sunlight
and so by getting us to mow the lawn we keep the trees from coming back which in new england happens very very quickly
so i started looking at things this way and wrote a whole book about it called the botany of desire
and i realized that in the same way you can look at a flower and deduce all sorts of interesting things about the taste and the desires of bees that they like sweetness that they like this color and not that color that they like symmetry what could we find out about ourselves by doing the same thing
that a certain kind of potato a certain kind of drug a sativa indica cannabis cross has something to say about us
and that wouldnt this be kind of an interesting way to look at the world
now the test of any idea i said it was a literary conceit is what does it get us
and when youre talking about nature which is really my subject as a writer how does it meet the aldo leopold test
which is does it make us better citizens of the biotic community
get us to do things that leads to the support and perpetuation of the biota rather than its destruction
and i would submit that this idea does this
so let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way besides some entertaining insights about human desire
as an intellectual matter looking at the world from other species points of view helps us deal with this weird anomaly which is and this is in the realm of intellectual history which is that we have this darwinian revolution years ago
ugh mini me
we have this intellectual this darwinian revolution in which thanks to darwin we figured out we are just one species among many evolution is working on us the same way its working on all the others we are acted upon as well as acting we are really in the fiber the fabric of life
but the weird thing is we have not absorbed this lesson years later none of us really believes this
we are still cartesians the children of descartes who believe that subjectivity consciousness sets us apart that the world is divided into subjects and objects that there is nature on one side culture on another
as soon as you start seeing things from the plants point of view or the animals point of view you realize that the real literary conceit is that is the idea that nature is opposed to culture the idea that consciousness is everything and thats another very important thing it does
looking at the world from other species points of view is a cure for the disease of human self importance
you suddenly realize that consciousness which we value and we consider the crowning achievement of nature human consciousness is really just another set of tools for getting along in the world
and its kind of natural that we would think it was the best tool
but you know theres a comedian who said well whos telling me that consciousness is so good and so important
well consciousness
so when you look at the plants you realize that there are other tools and theyre just as interesting
ill give you two examples also from the garden lima beans you know what a lima bean does when its attacked by spider mites
it releases this volatile chemical that goes out into the world and summons another species of mite that comes in and attacks the spider mite defending the lima bean
so what plants have while we have consciousness tool making language they have biochemistry
and they have perfected that to a degree far beyond what we can imagine
their complexity their sophistication is something to really marvel at and i think its really the scandal of the human genome project
you know we went into it thinking or human genes and we came out with only
just to give you grounds for comparison rice genes
so whos the more sophisticated species
well were all equally sophisticated
weve been evolving just as long just along different paths
so cure for self importance way to sort of make us feel the darwinian idea
and thats really what i do as a writer as a storyteller is try to make people feel what we know and tell stories that actually help us think ecologically
now the other use of this is practical
and im going to take you to a farm right now because i used this idea to develop my understanding of the food system and what i learned in fact is that we are all now being manipulated by corn
and the talk you heard about ethanol earlier today to me is the final triumph of corn over good sense
it is part of corns scheme for world domination
and you will see the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year and there will be that much more habitat because weve decided ethanol is going to help us
so it helped me understand industrial agriculture which of course is a cartesian system
its based on this idea that we bend other species to our will and that we are in charge and that we create these factories and we have these technological inputs and we get the food out of it or the fuel or whatever we want
let me take you to a very different kind of farm
this is a farm in the shenandoah valley of virginia
i went looking for a farm where these ideas about looking at things from the species point of view are actually implemented and i found it in a man the farmers name is joel salatin
and i spent a week as an apprentice on his farm and i took away from this some of the most hopeful news about our relationship to nature that ive ever come across in years of writing about nature
and that is this the farm is called polyface which means
the idea is hes got six different species of animals as well as some plants growing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement
its permaculture those of you who know a little bit about this such that the cows and the pigs and the sheep and the turkeys and the
what else does he have
all the six different species rabbits actually are all performing ecological services for one another such that the manure of one is the lunch for the other and they take care of pests for one another
its a very elaborate and beautiful dance but im going to just give you a close up on one piece of it and that is the relationship between his cattle and his chickens his laying hens
and ill show you if you take this approach what you get ok
and this is a lot more than growing food as youll see this is a different way to think about nature and a way to get away from the zero sum notion the cartesian idea that either natures winning or were winning and that for us to get what we want nature is diminished
so one day cattle in a pen
the only technology involved here is this cheap electric fencing relatively new hooked to a car battery even i could carry a quarter acre paddock set it up in minutes
cows graze one day they move ok
they graze everything down intensive grazing
he waits three days and then we towed in something called the eggmobile
the eggmobile is a very rickety contraption it looks like a prairie schooner made out of boards but it houses chickens
he tows this into the paddock three days later and opens the gangplank turns them down and hens come streaming down the gangplank clucking gossiping as chickens will and they make a beeline for the cow patties
and what theyre doing is very interesting theyre digging through the cow patties for the maggots the grubs the larvae of flies
and the reason hes waited three days is because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day those larvae will hatch and hell have a huge fly problem
but he waits that long to grow them as big and juicy and tasty as he can because they are the chickens favorite form of protein
so the chickens do their kind of little breakdance and theyre pushing around the manure to get at the grubs and in the process theyre spreading the manure out
very useful second ecosystem service
and third while theyre in this paddock they are of course defecating madly and their very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field
they then move out to the next one and in the course of just a few weeks the grass just enters this blaze of growth
and within four or five weeks he can do it again
he can graze again he can cut he can bring in another species like the lambs or he can make hay for the winter
now i want you to just look really close up onto whats happened there
so its a very productive system
and what i need to tell you is that on acres he gets pounds of beef pounds of pork dozen eggs broilers turkeys rabbits an immense amount of food
you know you hear can organic feed the world
well look how much food you can produce on acres if you do this kind of
again give each species what it wants let it realize its desires its physiological distinctiveness
put that in play
but look at it from the point of view of the grass now
what happens to the grass when you do this
when a ruminant grazes grass the grass is cut from this height to this height and it immediately does something very interesting
any one of you who gardens knows that there is something called the root shoot ratio and plants need to keep the root mass in some rough balance with the leaf mass to be happy
so when they lose a lot of leaf mass they shed roots they kind of cauterize them and the roots die
and the species in the soil go to work basically chewing through those roots decomposing them the earthworms the fungi the bacteria and the result is new soil
this is how soil is created
its created from the bottom up
this is how the prairies were built the relationship between bison and grasses
and what i realized when i understood this and if you ask joel salatin what he is hell tell you hes not a chicken farmer hes not a sheep farmer hes not a cattle rancher hes a grass farmer because grass is really the keystone species of such a system is that if you think about it this completely contradicts the tragic idea of nature we hold in our heads which is that for us to get what we want nature is diminished
more for us less for nature
here all this food comes off this farm and at the end of the season there is actually more soil more fertility and more biodiversity
its a remarkably hopeful thing to do
there are a lot of farmers doing this today
this is well beyond organic agriculture which is still a cartesian system more or less
and what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species take account of the soil that even with nothing more than this perspectival idea because there is no technology involved here except for those fences which are so cheap they could be all over africa in no time that we can take the food we need from the earth and actually heal the earth in the process
this is a way to reanimate the world and thats whats so exciting about this perspective
when we really begin to feel darwins insights in our bones the things we can do with nothing more than these ideas are something to be very hopeful about
thank you very much

i worked on forestry issues in wwf
i worked on development and agriculture issues in the u n system
about years in total and then three years ago i found myself talking to ikeas ceo about joining his team
like many people here well i want to maximize my personal impact in the world so im going to explain why i joined the team there
but first lets just take three numbers
the first number is three three billion people
this is the number of people joining the global middle class by coming out of poverty
its fantastic for them and their families but weve got two billion people in the global middle class today and this swells that number to five a big challenge when we already have resource scarcity
the second number is six this is six degrees centigrade what were heading towards in terms of global warming
were not heading towards one degree or three degrees or four degrees were heading toward six degrees
and if you think about it all of the weird weather weve been having the last few years much of that is due to just one degree warming and we need emissions to peak by the end of this decade globally and then come down
its not inevitable but we need to act decisively
the third number is thats the number of cities in the world that had a million or more people when my grandmother was born
you can see my grandmother there
that was in the beginning of the last century
so just cities she was born in manchester england the ninth largest city in the world
now there are cities nearly with a million people or more in them
and if you look at the century from to thats the century when we build all the worlds cities the century that were in the middle of right now
every other century was kind of practice and this lays down a blueprint for how we live
so think about it
were building cities like never before bringing people out of poverty like never before and changing the climate like never before
sustainability has gone from a nice to do to a must do
its about what we do right here right now and for the rest of our working lives
so im going to talk a little bit about what business can do and what a business like ikea can do and we have a sustainability strategy called people and planet positive to help guide our business to have a positive impact on the world
why would we not want to have a positive impact on the world as a business
other companies have sustainability strategies
im going to refer to some of those as well and im just going to mention a few of the commitments as illustrations that weve got
but first lets think of customers
we know from asking people from china to the u s
that the vast majority of people care about sustainability after the day to day issues the day to day issues of how do i get my kids to school
can i pay the bills at the end of the month
then they care about big issues like climate change
but they want it to be easy affordable and attractive and they expect business to help and theyre a little bit disappointed today
so take your mind back and think of the first sustainable products
we had detergents that could wash your whites grayer
we had the early energy efficient light bulbs that took five minutes to warm up and then you were left looking a kind of sickly color
and we had the rough recycled toilet paper
so every time you pulled on a t shirt or switched the light on or went to the bathroom or sometimes all three together you were reminded sustainability was about compromise
it wasnt a great start
today we have choices
we can make products that are beautiful or ugly sustainable or unsustainable affordable or expensive functional or useless
so lets make beautiful functional affordable sustainable products
lets take the led
the led is the next best thing to daylight
the old fashioned lightbulbs the incandescent bulbs im not going to ask for a show of hands of how many of you still have them in your homes wasting energy every time you switch them on change them after this or whether we have them on the stage here at ted or not but those old incandescent light bulbs really should have been sold as heaters
they were mis sold for more than a hundred years
they produced heat and a little bit of light on the side
now we have lights that produce light and a little bit of heat on the side
you save percent of the electricity with an led that you would have done in an old incandescent
and the best thing is theyll also last for more than years
so think about that
youll change your smartphone seven or eight times probably more if youre in this audience
youll change your car if you have one three or four times
your kids could go to school go to college go away and have kids of their own come back bring the grandkids youll have the same lightbulb saving you energy
so leds are fantastic
what we decided to do was not to sell leds on the side marked up high and continue to push all the old bulbs the halogens and the cfls
we decided over the next two years we will ban the halogens and the cfls ourselves
we will go all in
and this is what business needs to do go all in go percent because then you stop investing in the old stuff you invest in the new stuff you lower costs you use your supply chain and your creativity and you get the prices down so everybody can afford the best lights so they can save energy
its not just about products in peoples homes
weve got to think about the raw materials that produce our products
obviously theres fantastic opportunities with recycled materials and we can and will go zero waste
and theres opportunities in a circular economy
but were still dependent on natural raw materials
lets take cotton
cottons brilliant probably many people are wearing cotton right now
its a brilliant textile in use
its really dirty in production
it uses lots of pesticides lots of fertilizer lots of water
so weve worked with others with other businesses and ngos on the better cotton initiative working right back down to the farm and there you can halve the amount of water and halve the chemical inputs the yields increase and percent of the costs of running many of these farms with farmers with low incomes can be chemical imports
yields increase and you halve the input costs
farmers are coming out of poverty they love it
already hundreds of thousands of farmers have been reached and now weve got percent better cotton in our business
again were going all in
by well be percent better cotton
take the topic of percent targets actually
people sometimes think that percents going to be hard and weve had the conversation in the business
actually we found percent is easier to do than percent or percent
if you have a percent target everyone in the business finds a reason to be in the percent
when its percent its kind of clear and businesspeople like clarity because then you just get the job done
so wood we know with forestry its a choice
youve got illegal logging and deforestation still on a very large scale or you can have fantastic responsible forestry that we can be proud of
its a simple choice so weve worked for many years with the forest stewardship council with literally hundreds of other organizations and theres a point here about collaboration
so hundreds of others of ngos of forest workers unions and of businesses have helped create the forest stewardship council which sets standards for forestry and then checks the forestrys good on the ground
now together through our supply chain with partners weve managed to certify million hectares of forestry
thats about the size of germany
and weve decided in the next three years we will double the volume of certified material we put through our business
so be decisive on these issues
use your supply chain to drive good
but then it comes to your operations
some things are certain i think
we know well use electricity in or years time
we know the sun will be shining somewhere and the wind will still be blowing in or years time
so why not make our energy out of the sun and the wind
and why not take control of it ourselves
so were going percent renewable
by well produce more renewable energy than the energy we consume as a business
for all of our stores our own factories our distribution centers weve installed solar panels so far and weve got wind farms we own and operate in six countries and were not done yet
but think of a solar panel
a solar panel pays for itself in seven or eight years
the electricity is free
every time the sun comes out after that the electricity is free
so this is a good thing for the cfo not just the sustainability guy
every business can do things like this
but then weve got to look beyond our operations and i think everybody would agree that now business has to take full responsibility for the impacts of your supply chain
many businesses now fortunately have codes of conduct and audit their supply chains but not every business far from it
and this came in ikea actually in the
we found there was a risk of child labor in the supply chain and people in the business were shocked
and it was clearly totally unacceptable so then you have to act
so a code of conduct was developed and now we have auditors out in the world every day making sure all our factories secure good working conditions and protect human rights and make sure there is no child labor
but its not just as simple as making sure theres no child labor
youve got to say thats not enough today
i think wed all agree that children are the most important people in the world and the most vulnerable
so what can a business do today to actually use your total value chain to support a better quality of life and protect child rights
weve worked with unicef and save the children on developing some new business principles with childrens rights
increasing numbers of businesses are signing up to these but actually in a survey many business leaders said they thought their business had nothing to do with children
so what we decided to do was we will look and ask ourselves the tough questions with partners who know more than us what can we do to go beyond our business to help improve the lives of children
we also have a foundation thats committed to work through partners and help improve the lives and protect the rights of million children by
you know the phrase you can manage what you measure
well you should measure what you care about
if youre not measuring things you dont care and you dont know
so lets take an example measure the things that are important in your business
isnt it about time that businesses were led equally by men and women
so we know for our managers across ikea that percent are women today but its not enough and we want to close the gap and follow it all the way through to senior management
and we do not want to wait another hundred years
so weve launched a womens open network this week in ikea and well do whatever it takes to lead the change
so the message here is measure what you care about and lead the change and dont wait a hundred years
so weve gone from sustainability being a nice to do to a must do its a must do
its still nice to do but its a must do
and everybody can do something on this as an individual
be a discerning consumer
vote with your wallets
search out the companies that are acting on this
but also there are other businesses already acting
i mentioned renewable energy
you go to google or lego theyre going percent renewable too in the same way that we are
on having really good sustainability strategies there are companies like nike patagonia timberland marks amp spencer
but i dont think any of those businesses would say theyre perfect we certainly wouldnt
well make mistakes going forward but its about setting a clear direction being transparent having a dialogue with the right partners and choosing to lead on the issues that really count
so if youre a business leader if youre not already weaving sustainability right into the heart of your business model id urge you to do so
and together we can help create a sustainable world and if we get it right we can make sustainability affordable for the many people not a luxury for the few
thank you

title jon nguyen tour the solar system from home title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript want to navigate the solar system without having to buy that expensive spacecraft jon nguyen demos nasajpls eyes on the solar system free to use software for exploring the planets moons asteroids and spacecraft that rotate around our sun in real time description
as a kid i was fascinated with all things air and space
i would watch nova on pbs
our school would show bill nye the science guy
when i was in elementary school my next door neighbor he gave me a book for my birthday
it was an astronomy book and i poured over that thing for hours on end and it was a combination of all these things that inspired me to pursue space exploration as my own personal dream and part of that dream was i always wanted to just fly around the solar system and visit different planets and visit moons and spacecraft
well a number of years later i graduated from ucla and i found myself at nasa working for the jet propulsion laboratory and there our team was challenged to create a visualization of the solar system and today i want to show you what weve done so far
now the kicker is everything im about to do here you can do at home because we built this for the public for you guys to use
so what youre looking at right now is the earth
you can see the united states and california and san diego and you can use the mouse or the keyboard to spin things around
now this isnt new anyone whos used google earth has seen this before but one thing we like to say in our group is we do the opposite of google earth
google earth goes from this view down to your backyard
we go from this view out to the stars
so the earth is cool but what we really want to show are the spacecraft so im going to bring the interface back up and now youre looking at a number of satellites orbiting the earth
these are a number of our science space earth orbiters
we havent included military satellites and weather satellites and communication satellites and reconnaissance satellites
if we did it would be a complete mess because theres a lot of stuff out there
and the cool thing is we actually created models for a number of these spacecraft so if you want to visit any of these all you need to do is double click on them
so im going to find the international space station double click and it will take us all the way down to the iss
and now youre riding along with the iss where it is right now
and the other cool thing is not only can we move the camera around we can also control time so i can slide this jog dial here to shuttle time forward and now we can see what a sunset on the iss would look like and they get one every minutes
all right so what about the rest of it
well i can click on this home button over here and that will take us up to the inner solar system and now were looking at the rest of the solar system
you can see theres saturn theres jupiter and while were here i want to point out something
its actually pretty busy
here we have the mars science laboratory on its way to mars just launched last weekend
here we have juno on its cruise to jupiter there
we have dawn orbiting vesta and we have over here new horizons on a straight shot to pluto
and i mention this because theres this strange public perception that nasas dead that the space shuttles stopped flying and all of the sudden theres no more spacecraft out there
well a lot of what nasa does is robotic exploration and we have a lot of spacecraft out there
granted were not sending humans up at the moment well at least with our own launch vehicles but nasa is far from dead and one of the reasons why we write a program like this is so that people realize that theres so many other things that were doing
anyway while were here again if you want to visit anything all you need to do is double click
so im just going to double click on vesta and here we have dawn orbiting vesta and this is happening right now
im going to double click on uranus and we can see uranus rotating on its side along with its moons
you can see how its tilted at about degrees
and just being able to visit different places and go through different times we have data from to
granted we dont have everything in between because some of the data is hard to get
just being able to visit places in different times you can explore this for hours literally hours on end but i want to show you one thing in particular so im going to open up the destination tab spacecraft outer planet missions voyager and im going to bring up the titan flyby
so now weve gone back in time
were now riding along with voyager
the date here is november
now theres a funny thing going on here
it doesnt look like anythings going on
it looks like ive paused the program
its actually running at real rate right now one second per second and in fact voyager here is flying by titan at i think its miles per hour
it only looks like nothings moving because well saturn here is miles away and titan here is to miles away
its just the vastness of space makes it look like nothings happening
but to make it more interesting im going to speed up time and we can watch as voyager flies by titan which is a hazy moon of saturn
it actually has a very thick atmosphere
and im going to recenter the camera on saturn here
im going to pull out and i want to show you voyager as it flies by saturn
theres a point to be made here
with a visualization like this we can not only just say voyager flew by saturn
theres a whole story to tell here
and even better because its an interactive application you can tell the story for yourself
if you want to pause it you can pause it
if you want to keep going if you want to change the camera angle you can do that and because of that i can show you that voyager doesnt just fly by saturn
it actually flies underneath saturn
now what happens is as it flies underneath saturn saturn grabs it gravitationally and flings it up and out of the solar system so if i just keep letting this go you can see voyager fly up like that
and in fact im going to go back to the solar system
im going to go back to today now and i want to show you where voyager is
right there above way above the solar system way beyond our solar system
and heres the thing now you know how it got there
now you know why and to me thats the point of this program
you can manipulate it yourself
you can fly around yourself and you can learn for yourself
you know the theme today is the world in your grasp
well were trying to give you the solar system in your grasp and we hope once its there youll be able to learn for yourself what weve done out there and what were about to do
and my personal dream is for kids to take this and explore and see the wonders out there and be inspired as i was as a kid to pursue stem education and to pursue a dream in space exploration
thank you

title sebastian seung i am my connectome title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript sebastian seung is mapping a massively ambitious new model of the brain that focuses on the connections between each neuron he calls it our connectome and its as individual as our genome and understanding it could open a new way to understand our brains and our minds description
we live in in a remarkable time the age of genomics
your genome is the entire sequence of your dna
your sequence and mine are slightly different
thats why we look different
ive got brown eyes you might have blue or gray
but its not just skin deep
the headlines tell us that genes can give us scary diseases maybe even shape our personality or give us mental disorders
our genes seem to have awesome power over our destinies
and yet i would like to think that i am more than my genes
what do you guys think
are you more than your genes
yes
i think some people agree with me
i think we should make a statement
i think we should say it all together
all right im more than my genes all together
everybody i am more than my genes
sebastian seung what am i
i am my connectome
now since you guys are really great maybe you can humor me and say this all together too
right all together now
everybody i am my connectome
ss that sounded great
you know you guys are so great you dont even know what a connectome is and youre willing to play along with me
i could just go home now
well so far only one connectome is known that of this tiny worm
its modest nervous system consists of just neurons
and in the and a team of scientists mapped all connections between the neurons
in this diagram every node is a neuron and every line is a connection
this is the connectome of the worm c elegans
your connectome is far more complex than this because your brain contains billion neurons and times as many connections
theres a diagram like this for your brain but theres no way it would fit on this slide
your connectome contains one million times more connections than your genome has letters
thats a lot of information
whats in that information
we dont know for sure but there are theories
since the century neuroscientists have speculated that maybe your memories the information that makes you you maybe your memories are stored in the connections between your brains neurons
and perhaps other aspects of your personal identity maybe your personality and your intellect maybe theyre also encoded in the connections between your neurons
and so now you can see why i proposed this hypothesis i am my connectome
i didnt ask you to chant it because its true i just want you to remember it
and in fact we dont know if this hypothesis is correct because we have never had technologies powerful enough to test it
finding that worm connectome took over a dozen years of tedious labor
and to find the connectomes of brains more like our own we need more sophisticated technologies that are automated that will speed up the process of finding connectomes
and in the next few minutes ill tell you about some of these technologies which are currently under development in my lab and the labs of my collaborators
now youve probably seen pictures of neurons before
you can recognize them instantly by their fantastic shapes
they extend long and delicate branches and in short they look like trees
but this is just a single neuron
in order to find connectomes we have to see all the neurons at the same time
so lets meet bobby kasthuri who works in the laboratory of jeff lichtman at harvard university
bobby is holding fantastically thin slices of a mouse brain
and were zooming in by a factor of times to obtain the resolution so that we can see the branches of neurons all at the same time
except you still may not really recognize them and thats because we have to work in three dimensions
if we take many images of many slices of the brain and stack them up we get a three dimensional image
and still you may not see the branches
so we start at the top and we color in the cross section of one branch in red and we do that for the next slice and for the next slice
and we keep on doing that slice after slice
if we continue through the entire stack we can reconstruct the three dimensional shape of a small fragment of a branch of a neuron
and we can do that for another neuron in green
and you can see that the green neuron touches the red neuron at two locations and these are what are called synapses
lets zoom in on one synapse and keep your eyes on the interior of the green neuron
you should see small circles these are called vesicles
they contain a molecule know as a neurotransmitter
and so when the green neuron wants to communicate it wants to send a message to the red neuron it spits out neurotransmitter
at the synapse the two neurons are said to be connected like two friends talking on the telephone
so you see how to find a synapse
how can we find an entire connectome
well we take this three dimensional stack of images and treat it as a gigantic three dimensional coloring book
we color every neuron in in a different color and then we look through all of the images find the synapses and note the colors of the two neurons involved in each synapse
if we can do that throughout all the images we could find a connectome
now at this point youve learned the basics of neurons and synapses
and so i think were ready to tackle one of the most important questions in neuroscience how are the brains of men and women different
according to this self help book guys brains are like waffles they keep their lives compartmentalized in boxes
girls brains are like spaghetti everything in their life is connected to everything else
you guys are laughing but you know this book changed my life
but seriously whats wrong with this
you already know enough to tell me whats wrong with this statement
it doesnt matter whether youre a guy or girl everyones brains are like spaghetti
or maybe really really fine capellini with branches
just as one strand of spaghetti contacts many other strands on your plate one neuron touches many other neurons through their entangled branches
one neuron can be connected to so many other neurons because there can be synapses at these points of contact
by now you might have sort of lost perspective on how large this cube of brain tissue actually is
and so lets do a series of comparisons to show you
i assure you this is very tiny its just six microns on a side
so heres how it stacks up against an entire neuron
and you can tell that really only the smallest fragments of branches are contained inside this cube
and a neuron well thats smaller than brain
and thats just a mouse brain its a lot smaller than a human brain
so when show my friends this sometimes theyve told me you know sebastian you should just give up
neuroscience is hopeless
because if you look at a brain with your naked eye you dont really see how complex it is but when you use a microscope finally the hidden complexity is revealed
in the century the mathematician and philosopher blaise pascal wrote of his dread of the infinite his feeling of insignificance at contemplating the vast reaches of outer space
and as a scientist im not supposed to talk about my feelings too much information professor
but may i
i feel curiosity and i feel wonder but at times i have also felt despair
why did i choose to study this organ that is so awesome in its complexity that it might well be infinite
its absurd
how could we even dare to think that we might ever understand this
and yet i persist in this quixotic endeavor
and indeed these days i harbor new hopes
someday a fleet of microscopes will capture every neuron and every synapse in a vast database of images
and some day artificially intelligent supercomputers will analyze the images without human assistance to summarize them in a connectome
i do not know but i hope that i will live to see that day because finding an entire human connectome is one of the greatest technological challenges of all time
it will take the work of generations to succeed
at the present time my collaborators and i what were aiming for is much more modest just to find partial connectomes of tiny chunks of mouse and human brain
but even that will be enough for the first tests of this hypothesis that i am my connectome
for now let me try to convince you of the plausibility of this hypothesis that its actually worth taking seriously
as you grow during childhood and age during adulthood your personal identity changes slowly
likewise every connectome changes over time
what kinds of changes happen
well neurons like trees can grow new branches and they can lose old ones
synapses can be created and they can be eliminated
and synapses can grow larger and they can grow smaller
second question what causes these changes
well its true
to some extent they are programmed by your genes
but thats not the whole story because there are signals electrical signals that travel along the branches of neurons and chemical signals that jump across from branch to branch
these signals are called neural activity
and theres a lot of evidence that neural activity is encoding our thoughts feelings and perceptions our mental experiences
and theres a lot of evidence that neural activity can cause your connections to change
and if you put those two facts together it means that your experiences can change your connectome
and thats why every connectome is unique even those of genetically identical twins
the connectome is where nature meets nurture
and it might true that just the mere act of thinking can change your connectome an idea that you may find empowering
whats in this picture
a cool and refreshing stream of water you say
what else is in this picture
do not forget that groove in the earth called the stream bed
without it the water would not know in which direction to flow
and with the stream i would like to propose a metaphor for the relationship between neural activity and connectivity
neural activity is constantly changing
its like the water of the stream it never sits still
the connections of the brains neural network determines the pathways along which neural activity flows
and so the connectome is like bed of the stream but the metaphor is richer than that because its true that the stream bed guides the flow of the water but over long timescales the water also reshapes the bed of the stream
and as i told you just now neural activity can change the connectome
and if youll allow me to ascend to metaphorical heights i will remind you that neural activity is the physical basis or so neuroscientists think of thoughts feelings and perceptions
and so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness
neural activity is its water and the connectome is its bed
so lets return from the heights of metaphor and return to science
suppose our technologies for finding connectomes actually work
how will we go about testing the hypothesis i am my connectome
well i propose a direct test
let us attempt to read out memories from connectomes
consider the memory of long temporal sequences of movements like a pianist playing a beethoven sonata
according to a theory that dates back to the century such memories are stored as chains of synaptic connections inside your brain
because if the first neurons in the chain are activated through their synapses they send messages to the second neurons which are activated and so on down the line like a chain of falling dominoes
and this sequence of neural activation is hypothesized to be the neural basis of those sequence of movements
so one way of trying to test the theory is to look for such chains inside connectomes
but it wont be easy because theyre not going to look like this
theyre going to be scrambled up
so well have to use our computers to try to unscramble the chain
and if we can do that the sequence of the neurons we recover from that unscrambling will be a prediction of the pattern of neural activity that is replayed in the brain during memory recall
and if that were successful that would be the first example of reading a memory from a connectome
what a mess have you ever tried to wire up a system as complex as this
i hope not
but if you have you know its very easy to make a mistake
the branches of neurons are like the wires of the brain
can anyone guess whats the total length of wires in your brain
ill give you a hint its a big number
i estimate millions of miles all packed in your skull
and if you appreciate that number you can easily see there is huge potential for mis wiring of the brain
and indeed the popular press loves headlines like anorexic brains are wired differently or autistic brains are wired differently
these are plausible claims but in truth we cant see the brains wiring clearly enough to tell if these are really true
and so the technologies for seeing connectomes will allow us to finally read mis wiring of the brain to see mental disorders in connectomes
sometimes the best way to test a hypothesis is to consider its most extreme implication
philosophers know this game very well
if you believe that i am my connectome i think you must also accept the idea that death is the destruction of your connectome
i mention this because there are prophets today who claim that technology will fundamentally alter the human condition and perhaps even transform the human species
one of their most cherished dreams is to cheat death by that practice known as cryonics
if you pay dollars you can arrange to have your body frozen after death and stored in liquid nitrogen in one of these tanks in an arizona warehouse awaiting a future civilization that is advanced to resurrect you
should we ridicule the modern seekers of immortality calling them fools
or will they someday chuckle over our graves
i dont know i prefer to test their beliefs scientifically
i propose that we attempt to find a connectome of a frozen brain
we know that damage to the brain occurs after death and during freezing
the question is has that damage erased the connectome
if it has there is no way that any future civilization will be able to recover the memories of these frozen brains
resurrection might succeed for the body but not for the mind
on the other hand if the connectome is still intact we cannot ridicule the claims of cryonics so easily
ive described a quest that begins in the world of the very small and propels us to the world of the far future
connectomes will mark a turning point in human history
as we evolved from our ape like ancestors on the african savanna what distinguished us was our larger brains
we have used our brains to fashion ever more amazing technologies
eventually these technologies will become so powerful that we will use them to know ourselves by deconstructing and reconstructing our own brains
i believe that this voyage of self discovery is not just for scientists but for all of us
and im grateful for the opportunity to share this voyage with you today
thank you

title andreas raptopoulos no roads there s a drone for that title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript a billion people in the world lack access to all season roads could the structure of the internet provide a model for how to reach them andreas raptopoulos of matternet thinks so he introduces a new type of transportation system that uses electric autonomous flying machines to deliver medicine food goods and supplies wherever they are needed description
one billion people in the world today do not have access to all season roads
one billion people
one seventh of the earths population are totally cut off for some part of the year
we cannot get medicine to them reliably they cannot get critical supplies and they cannot get their goods to market in order to create a sustainable income
in sub saharan africa for instance percent of roads are unusable in the wet season
investments are being made but at the current level its estimated its going to take them years to catch up
in the u s alone theres more than four million miles of roads very expensive to build very expensive to maintain infrastructure with a huge ecological footprint and yet very often congested
so we saw this and we thought can there be a better way
can we create a system using todays most advanced technologies that can allow this part of the world to leapfrog in the same way theyve done with mobile telephones in the last years
many of those nations have excellent telecommunications today without ever putting copper lines in the ground
could we do the same for transportation
imagine this scenario
imagine you are in a maternity ward in mali and have a newborn in need of urgent medication
what would you do today
well you would place a request via mobile phone and someone would get the request immediately
thats the part that works
the medication may take days to arrive though because of bad roads
thats the part thats broken
we believe we can deliver it within hours with an electric autonomous flying vehicle such as this
this can transport a small payload today about two kilograms over a short distance about kilometers but its part of a wider network that may cover the entire country maybe even the entire continent
its an ultra flexible automated logistics network
its a network for a transportation of matter
we call it matternet
we use three key technologies
the first is electric autonomous flying vehicles
the second is automated ground stations that the vehicles fly in and out of to swap batteries and fly farther or pick up or deliver loads
and the third is the operating system that manages the whole network
lets look at each one of those technologies in a bit more detail
first of all the uavs
eventually were going to be using all sorts of vehicles for different payload capacities and different ranges
today were using small quads
these are able to transport two kilograms over kilometers in just about minutes
compare this with trying to trespass a bad road in the developing world or even being stuck in traffic in a developed world country
these fly autonomously
this is the key to the technology
so they use gps and other sensors on board to navigate between ground stations
every vehicle is equipped with an automatic payload and battery exchange mechanism so these vehicles navigate to those ground stations they dock swap a battery automatically and go out again
the ground stations are located on safe locations on the ground
they secure the most vulnerable part of the mission which is the landing
they are at known locations on the ground so the paths between them are also known which is very important from a reliability perspective from the whole network
apart from fulfilling the energy requirements of the vehicles eventually theyre going to be becoming commercial hubs where people can take out loads or put loads into the network
the last component is the operating system that manages the whole network
it monitors weather data from all the ground stations and optimizes the routes of the vehicles through the system to avoid adverse weather conditions avoid other risk factors and optimize the use of the resources throughout the network
i want to show you what one of those flights looks like
here we are flying in haiti last summer where weve done our first field trials
were modeling here a medical delivery in a camp we set up after the earthquake
people there love this
and i want to show you what one of those vehicles looks like up close
so this is a vehicle
costs are coming down very rapidly
we use this in all sorts of weather conditions very hot and very cold climates very strong winds theyre very sturdy vehicles
imagine if your life depended on this package somewhere in africa or in new york city after sandy
the next big question is whats the cost
well it turns out that the cost to transport two kilograms over kilometers with this vehicle is just cents
and its counterintuitive but the cost of energy expended for the flight is only two cents of a dollar today and were just at the beginning of this
when we saw this we felt that this is something that can have significant impact in the world
so we said okay how much does it cost to set up a network somewhere in the world
and we looked at setting up a network in lesotho for transportation of hiv aids samples
the problem there is how do you take them from clinics where theyre being collected to hospitals where theyre being analyzed
and we said what if we wanted to cover an area spanning around square kilometers
thats roughly one and a half times the size of manhattan
well it turns out that the cost to do that there would be less than a million dollars
compare this to normal infrastructure investments
we think this can be this is the power of a new paradigm
so here we are a new idea about a network for transportation that is based on the ideas of the internet
its decentralized its peer to peer its bidirectional highly adaptable with very low infrastructure investment very low ecological footprint
if it is a new paradigm though there must be other uses for it
it can be used perhaps in other places in the world
so lets look at the other end of the spectrum our cities and megacities
half of the earths population lives in cities today
half a billion of us live in megacities
we are living through an amazing urbanization trend
china alone is adding a megacity the size of new york city every two years
these are places that do have road infrastructure but its very inefficient
congestion is a huge problem
so we think it makes sense in those places to set up a network of transportation that is a new layer that sits between the road and the internet initially for lightweight urgent stuff and over time we would hope to develop this into a new mode of transportation that is truly a modern solution to a very old problem
its ultimately scalable with a very small ecological footprint operating in the background just like the internet
so when we started this a couple of years ago now weve had a lot of people come up to us who said this is a very interesting but crazy idea and certainly not something that you should engage with anytime soon
and of course were talking about drones right a technology thats not only unpopular in the west but one that has become a very very unpleasant fact of life for many living in poor countries especially those engaged in conflict
so why are we doing this
well we chose to do this one not because its easy but because it can have amazing impact
imagine one billion people being connected to physical goods in the same way that mobile telecommunications connected them to information
imagine if the next big network we built in the world was a network for the transportation of matter
in the developing world we would hope to reach millions of people with better vaccines reach them with better medication
it would give us an unfair advantage against battling hiv aids tuberculosis and other epidemics
over time we would hope it would become a new platform for economic transactions lifting millions of people out of poverty
in the developed world and the emerging world we would hope it would become a new mode of transportation that could help make our cities more livable
so for those that still believe that this is science fiction i firmly say to you that it is not
we do need to engage though in social fiction to make it happen
thank you

title jacqueline novogratz a third way to think about aid title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript the debate over foreign aid often pits those who mistrust charity against those who mistrust reliance on the markets jacqueline novogratz proposes a middle way she calls patient capital with promising examples of entrepreneurial innovation driving social change description
clearly were living in a moment of crisis
arguably the financial markets have failed us and the aid system is failing us and yet i stand firmly with the optimists who believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive
because of some of technologies weve been talking about
because of the resources the skills and certainly the surge of talent were seeing all around the world with the mindset to create change
and weve got a president who sees himself as a global citizen who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower but that weve got to engage in a different way with the world
and by definition every one of you who is in this room must consider yourself a global soul a global citizen
you work on the front lines and youve seen the best and the worst that human beings can do for one another and to one another
and no matter what country you live or work in youve also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of even in their most ordinariness
today there is a raging debate as to how best we lift people out of poverty how best we release their energies
on the one hand we have people that say the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out
and on the other we have people who say the problem is that we need more aid
and what i want to talk about is something that compliments both systems
we call it patient capital
the critics point to the billion dollars spent in africa since and say and what do we have but environmental degradation and incredible levels of poverty rampant corruption
they use mobutu as metaphor
and their policy prescription is to make government more accountable focus on the capital markets invest dont give anything away
on the other side as i said there are those who say the problem is that we need more money
that when it comes to the rich well bail out and well hand a lot of aid but when it comes to our poor brethren we want little to do with it
they point to the successes of aid the eradication of smallpox and the distribution of tens of millions of malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals
both sides are right
and the problem is that neither side is listening to the other
even more problematic theyre not listening to poor people themselves
after years of working on issues of poverty and innovation its true that there are probably no more market oriented individuals on the planet than low income people
they must navigate markets daily making micro decisions dozens and dozens to move their way through society and yet if a single catastrophic health problem impacts their family they could be put back into poverty sometimes for generations
and so we need both the market and we need aid
patient capital works between and tries to take the best of both
its money thats invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities and are building solutions to healthcare water housing alternative energy thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity but as individual customers consumers clients people who want to make decisions in their own lives
patient capital requires that we have incredible tolerance for risk a long time horizon in terms of allowing those entrepreneurs time to experiment to use the market as the best listening device that we have and the expectation of below market returns but outsized social impact
it recognizes that the market has its limitation and so patient capital also works with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy to include all people
now entrepreneurs need patient capital for three reasons
first they tend to work in markets where people make one two three dollars a day and they are making all of their decisions within that income level
second the geographies in which they work have terrible infrastructure no roads to speak of sporadic electricity and high levels of corruption
third they are often creating markets
even if youre bringing clean water for the first time into rural villages it is something new
and so many low income people have seen so many failed promises broken and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them that building trust takes a lot of time takes a lot of patience
it also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance
not only to build the systems the business models that allow us to reach low income people in a sustainable way but to connect those business to other markets to governments to corporations real partnerships if we want to get to scale
i want to share one story about an innovation called drip irrigation
in i met this incredible entrepreneur named amitabha sadangi from india whod been working for years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet
and he was expressing his frustration that the aid market had bypassed low income farmers altogether despite the fact that million farmers alone in india make under a dollar a day
they were creating subsidies either for large farms or they were giving inputs to the farmers that they thought they should use rather than that the farmers wanted to use
at the same time amitabha was obsessed with this drip irrigation technology that had been invented in israel
it was a way of bringing small amounts of water directly to the stalk of the plant
and it could transform swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green
but the market also had bypassed low income farmers because these systems were both too expensive and they were constructed for fields that were too large
the average small village farmer works on two acres or less
and so amitabha decided that he would take that innovation and he would redesign it from the perspective of the poor farmers themselves because he spent so many years listening to what they needed not what he thought that they should have
and he used three fundamental principles
the first one was miniaturization
the drip irrigation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quarter acre even if he had two because it was too frightening given all that he had at stake
second it had to be extremely affordable
in other words that risk on the quarter acre needed to be repaid in a single harvest or else they wouldnt take the risk
and third it had to be what amitabha calls infinitely expandable
what i mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre the farmers could buy a second and a third and a fourth
as of today ide india amitabhas organization has sold over farmers these systems and has seen their yields and incomes double or triple on average but this didnt happen overnight
in fact when you go back to the beginning there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day that were known to be some of the most risk averse people on the planet and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors agriculture
and so we needed grants and he used significant grants to research to experiment to fail to innovate and try again
and when he had a prototype and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers thats when patient capital could come in
and we helped him build a company for profit that would build on ides knowledge and start looking at sales and exports and be able to tap into other kinds of capital
secondarily we wanted to see if we could export this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries
and so we met dr sono khangharani in pakistan
and while again you needed patience to move a technology for the poor in india into pakistan just to get the permits over time we were able to start a company with dr sono who runs a large community development organization in the thar desert which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country
and though that company has just started our assumption is that there too well see the impact on millions
but drip irrigation isnt the only innovation
were starting to see these happening all around the world
in arusha tanzania a to z textile manufacturing has worked in partnership with us with unicef with the global fund to create a factory that now employs people mostly women
and they produce million lifesaving bednets for africans around the world
lifespring hospital is a joint venture between acumen and the government of india to bring quality affordable maternal health care to low income women and its been so successful that its currently building a new hospital every days
and ambulances decided that it was going to reinvent a completely broken industry building an ambulance service in bombay that would use the technology of google earth a sliding scale pricing system so that all people could have access and a severe and public decision not to engage in any form of corruption
so that in the terrorist attacks of november they were the first responder and are now beginning to scale because of partnership
theyve just won four government contracts to build off their ambulances and are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies in india
this idea of scale is critical
because were starting to see these enterprises reach hundreds of thousands of people all of the ones i discussed have reached at least a quarter million people
but thats obviously not enough
and its where the idea of partnership becomes so important
whether its by finding those innovations that can access the capital markets government itself or partner with major corporations there is unbelievable opportunity for innovation
president obama understands that
he recently authorized the creation of a social innovation fund to focus on what works in this country and look at how we can scale it
and i would submit that its time to consider a global innovation fund that would find these entrepreneurs around the world who really have innovations not only for their country but ones that we can use in the developed world as well
invest financial assistance but also management assistance
and then measure the returns both from a financial perspective and from a social impact perspective
when we think about new approaches to aid its impossible not to talk about pakistan
weve had a rocky relationship with that country and in all fairness the united states has not always been a very reliable partner
but again i would say that this is our moment for extraordinary things to happen
and if we take that notion of a global innovation fund we could use this time to invest not directly in government though we would have governments blessing nor in international experts but in the many existing entrepreneurs and civil society leaders who already are building wonderful innovations that are reaching people all across the country
people like rashani zafar who created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country and is a real role model for women inside and outside the country
and tasneem siddiqui who developed a way called incremental housing where he has moved slum dwellers into safe affordable community housing
educational initiatives like dil and the citizen foundation that are building schools across the country
its not hyperbole to say that these civil society institutions and these social entrepreneurs are building real alternatives to the taliban
ive invested in pakistan for over seven years now and those of you whove also worked there can attest that pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population and there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature
president kennedy said that those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable
i would say that the converse is true
that these social leaders who really are looking at innovation and extending opportunity to the percent of pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day provide real pathways to hope
and as we think about how we construct aid for pakistan while we need to strengthen the judiciary build greater stability we also need to think about lifting those leaders who can be role models for the rest of the world
on one of my last visits to pakistan i asked dr sono if he would take me to see some of the drip irrigation in the thar desert
and we left karachi one morning before dawn
it was about degrees
and we drove for eight hours along this moonscape like landscape with very little color lots of heat very little discussion because we were exhausted
and finally at the end of the journey i could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon
and as we got closer its significance became apparent
that there in the desert was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall
because one of the poorest farmers on earth had gotten access to a technology that had allowed him to change his own life
his name was raja and he had kind twinkly hazel eyes and warm expressive hands that reminded me of my father
and he said it was the first dry season in his entire life that he hadnt taken his children and grandchildren on a two day journey across the desert to work as day laborers at a commercial farm for about cents a day
because he was building these crops
and with the money he earned he could stay this year
and for the first time ever in three generations his children would go to school
we asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons
and he said of course i will
because i dont want them discriminated against anymore
when we think about solutions to poverty we cannot deny individuals their fundamental dignity
because at the end of the day dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth
and whats exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors who are building innovations that recognize that what people want is freedom and choice and opportunity
because that is where dignity really starts
martin luther king said that love without power is anemic and sentimental and that power without love is reckless and abusive
our generation has seen both approaches tried and often fail
but i think our generation also might be the first to have the courage to embrace both love and power
for that is what well need as we move forward to dream and imagine what it will really take to build a global economy that includes all of us and to finally extend that fundamental proposition that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet
the time for us to begin innovating and looking for new solutions a cross sector is now
i can only talk from my own experience but in eight years of running acumen fund ive seen the power of patient capital
not only to inspire innovation and risk taking but to truly build systems that have created more than jobs and delivered tens of millions of services and products to some of the poorest people on the planet
i know it works
but i know that many other kinds of innovation also work
and so i urge you in whatever sector you work in whatever job you do to start thinking about how we might build solutions that start from the perspective of those were trying to help
rather than what we think that they might need
it will take embracing the world with both arms
and it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability with a sense of integrity and perseverance
and yet these are the very qualities for which men and women have been honored throughout the generations
and there is so much good that we can do
just think of all those sunflowers in the desert
thank you

title paul moller my dream of a flying car title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript paul moller talks about the future of personal air travel the marriage of autos and flight that will give us true freedom to travel off road he shows two things hes working on the moller skycar and a passenger friendly hovering disc description
many of you could ask the question you know why is a flying car or maybe more accurately a roadable aircraft possible at this time
a number of years ago mr ford predicted that flying cars of some form would be available
now years later im here to tell you why its possible
when i was about five years old not very much about a year after mr ford made his predictions i was living in a rural part of canada on the side of a mountain in a very isolated area
getting to school for a kid that was actually pretty short for his age through the canadian winter was not a pleasant experience
it was a trying and scary thing for a young kid to be going through
at the end of my first year in school in the summer of that year i discovered a couple hummingbirds that were caught in a shed near my home
theyd worn themselves out beating themselves against the window and well they were easy to capture
i took them outside and as i let them go that split second even though they were very tired that second i let them go they hovered for a second then zipped off into the distance
i thought what a great way to get to school
for a kid at that age this was like infinite speed disappearing and i was very inspired by that
and so the next over the next six decades believe it or not ive built a number of aircraft with the goal of creating something that could do for you or me what the hummingbird does and give you that flexibility
ive called this vehicle generically a volantor after the latin word volant meaning to fly in a light nimble manner
volantor like helicopter perhaps
the faa the controlling body above all calls it a powered lift aircraft
and theyve actually issued a pilots license a powerlift pilots license for this type of aircraft
its closer than you think its kind of remarkable when you consider that there are no operational powered lift aircraft
so for once perhaps the government is ahead of itself
the press calls my particular volantor a skycar
this is a little bit earlier version of it thats why its given the x designation but its a four passenger aircraft that could take off vertically like a helicopter therefore it doesnt need an airfield
on the ground its powered electrically
its actually classified as a motorcycle because of the three wheels which is a great asset because it allows you theoretically to use this on the highways in most states and actually in all cities
so thats an asset because if youve got to deal with the crash protection issues of the automobile forget it youre never going to fly it
one could say that a helicopter does pretty much what the hummingbird does and gets around in much the same way and its true but a helicopter is a very complex device
its expensive so expensive that very few people could own or use it
its often been described because of its fragile nature and its complexity as a series of parts a large number of parts flying in formation
another difference and i have to describe this because its very personal another great difference between the helicopter and the volantor in my case the skycar volantor is the experience that ive had in flying both of those
in a helicopter you feel and its still a remarkable sensation you feel like youre being hauled up from above by a vibrating crane
when you get in the skycar and i can tell you theres only one other person thats flown it but he had the same sensation you really feel like youre being lifted up by a magic carpet without any vibration whatsoever the sensation is unbelievable
and its been a great motivator
i only get to fly this vehicle occasionally and only when i can persuade my stockholders to let me do so but its still one of those wonderful experiences that reward you for all that time
what we really need is something to replace the automobile for those plus mile trips
very few people realize that mile plus trips make up percent of the miles traveled in america
if we can get rid of that then the highways will now be useful to you as contrasted by whats happening in many parts of the world today
on this next slide is an interesting history of what we really have seen in infrastructure because whether i give you a perfect skycar the perfect vehicle for use its going to have very little value to you unless youve got a system to use it in
im sure any of you have asked the question yeah are there great things up there what am i going to do get up there
its bad enough on a highway whats it going to be like to be in the air
this world that youre going to be talking about tomorrow is going to be completely integrated youre not going to be a pilot youre going to be a passenger
and its the infrastructure that really determines whether this process goes forward
i can tell you technically we can build skycars my god we went to the moon
the technology there was much more difficult than what im dealing with here
but we have to have these priority changes we have to have infrastructure to go with this
historically you see that we got around years ago by canals and as that system disappeared were replaced by railroads
as that disappeared we came in with highways
but if you look at that top corner the highway system you see where we are today highways are no longer being built and thats a fact you wont see any additional highways in the next years
however the next years if like the last years were going to see percent more traffic
and where is that going to lead you to
so the issue then ive often asked is when is it going to happen
when are we going to be able to have these vehicles
and of course if you ask me im going to give you a really optimistic view
after all ive been spending years here believing its going to happen tomorrow
so im not going to quote myself on this
id prefer to quote someone else who testified with me before congress and in his position as head of nasa put forward this particular vision of the future of this type of aircraft
now i would argue actually if you look at the fact that on the highways today youre only averaging about miles per hour on average according to the dot the skycar travels at over miles an hour up to feet
and so in effect you could see perhaps a tenfold increase in the ability to get around as far as speed is concerned
unbeknownst to many of you the highway in the sky that im talking about here has been under construction for years
it makes use of the gps youre familiar with gps in your automobile but you may not be familiar with the fact that theres a gps u s theres a russian gps and theres a new gps system going to europe called galileo
with those three systems you have what is always necessary a level of redundancy that says if one system fails youll still have a way to make sure that youre being controlled
because if youre in this world where computers are controlling what youre doing its going to be very critical that something cant fail on you
how would a trip in a skycar work
well you cant right now take off from your home because its too noisy
i mean to be able to take off from your home youd have to be extremely quiet
but its still fairly quiet
youd motor electrically to a vertiport which may be a few blocks maybe even a few miles away
this is clearly as i said earlier a roadable aircraft and youre not going to spend that much time on the road
after all if you can fly like that why are you going to drive around on a highway
go to a local vertiport plug in your destination delivered almost like a passenger
you can play computer games you can sleep you can read on the way
this is the world there wont be you as a pilot and i know the pilots in the audience arent going to like that and ive had a lot of bad feedback from people who want to be up there flying around and experiencing that
and of course i suppose like recreational parks you can still do that
but the vehicle itself is going to be a very very controlled environment
or its going to have no use to you as a person who might use such a system
we flew the first vehicle for the international press in when i really got it started
i was a professor at the u c davis system and i got a lot of excitement around this and i was able to fund the initiation of the program back in that time
and then through the various years we invented various vehicles
actually the critical point was in when we demonstrated the stability of this vehicle how completely stable it was in all circumstances which is of course very critical
still not a practical vehicle during all of this but moving in the right direction we believe
finally in the early part of or actually the middle of we flew the which was the four passenger vehicle
in this case here were flying it remotely as we always did at the beginning
and we had very small power plants in it at this time
we are now installing larger powerplants which will make it possible for me to get back on board
a vertical takeoff aircraft is not the safest vehicle during the test flight program
theres an old adage that applied for the years between and when every aeronautical company was working on vertical takeoff aircraft
a vertical takeoff aircraft needs an artificial stabilization system thats essential
at least for the hover and the low speed flight
if that single stability system that brain that flies that aircraft fails or if the engine fails that vehicle crashes there is no option to that
and the adage that im referring to that applied at that time was that nothing comes down faster than a vtol aircraft upside down
thats a macabre comment because we lost a lot of pilots
in fact the aircraft companies gave up on vertical takeoff aircraft more or less for a number of years
and theres really only one operational aircraft in the world today thats a vertical takeoff aircraft as distinct from a helicopter and thats the hawker harrier jump jet
a vertical takeoff aircraft like the hummingbird has a very high metabolism which means it requires a lot of energy
getting that energy is very very difficult it all comes down to that power plant how to get a large amount of power in a small package
fortunately dr felix wankel invented the rotary engine
a very unique engine its round its small its vibration free
it fits exactly where we need to fit it right in the center of the hubs of the ducts in the system very critical in fact that engine for those who are into the automobile know that it recently is applied to the the mazda
and that sportscar won sports car of the year
wonderful engine
in that application it generates one horsepower per pound which is twice as good as your car engine today but only half of what we need
my company has spent years and many millions of dollars taking that rotary engine which was invented in the late and getting it to the point that we get over two horsepower per pound reliably and critical
we actually get horsepower into one cubic foot
we have eight engines in this vehicle
we have four computers we have two parachutes
redundancy is the critical issue here
if you want to stay alive youve got to have backups
and we have actually flown this vehicle and lost an engine and continued to hover
the computers back up each other theres a voting system if one computer is not agreeing with the other three its kicked out of the system
and then you have three you still have the triple redundancy
if one of those fails you still have a second chance
if you stick around then good luck
there wont be a third chance
the parachutes are there hopefully more for psychological than real reasons but they will be an ultimate backup if it comes to that
id like to show you an animation in this next one which is one element of the skycars use but its one that demonstrates how it could be used
you could think of it personally in your own terms of how you might use it
video skycar dispatched launch rescue vehicle for san francisco
paul moller i believe that personal transportation in something like the skycar probably in another volantor form as well will be a significant part of our lives as dr goldin says within the next years
and its going to change the demographics in a very significant way
if you can live miles from san francisco and get there in minutes youre going to sell your dollar apartment buy an upscale home on the side of a mountain buy a skycar which i think would be priced at that time perhaps in the area of dollars put money in the bank
thats a very significant incentive for getting out of san francisco
but you better be the first one out of town as the real estate values go to hell
developing the skycar has been a real challenge
obviously im dependent on a lot of other people believing in what im doing both financially and in technical help
and that has you run into situations where you have this great acceptance of what youre doing and a lot of rejection of the same kind of thing
i characterized this emerging technology in an aphorism as its described which really talks about what ive experienced and im sure what other people may have experienced in emerging technologies
theres an interesting poll that came out recently under nas i think its msnbc in which they asked the question are you in the market for a volantor
twenty three percent said yes as soon as possible
forty seven percent yes as soon as they could price could come down
twenty three percent said as soon as its proven safe
only seven percent said that they wouldnt consider buying a skycar
im encouraged by that at least it makes me feel like to some extent it is becoming self evident
that we need an alternative to the automobile at least for those mile trips and more so that the highways become usable in todays world

title rives reinventing the encyclopedia game title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript prompted by the encyclopaedia britannica ending its print publication performance poet rives resurrects a game from his childhood speaking at the tedxsummit in doha rives takes us on a charming tour through random bits of human knowledge from chimborazo the farthest point from the center of the earth to ham the astrochimp the first chimpanzee in outer space description
so last month the encyclopaedia britannica announced that it is going out of print after years which made me nostalgic because i remember playing a game with the colossal encyclopedia set in my hometown library back when i was a kid maybe years old
and i wondered if i could update that game not just for modern methods but for the modern me
so i tried
i went to an online encyclopedia wikipedia and i entered the term earth
you can start anywhere this time i chose earth
and the first rule of the game is pretty simple
you just have to read the article until you find something you dont know and preferably something your dad doesnt even know
and in this case i quickly found this the furthest point from the center of the earth is not the tip of mount everest like i might have thought its the tip of this mountain mount chimborazo in ecuador
the earth spins of course as it travels around the sun so the earth bulges a little bit around the middle like some earthlings
and even though mount chimborazo isnt the tallest mountain in the andes its one degree away from the equator its riding that bulge and so the summit of chimborazo is the farthest point on earth from the center of the earth
and it is really fun to say
so i immediately decided this is going to be the name of the game or my new exclamation
you can use it at ted
chimborazo right
its like eureka and bingo had a baby
i didnt know that thats pretty cool
chimborazo
so the next rule of the game is also pretty simple
you just have to find another term and look that up
now in the old days that meant getting out a volume and browsing through it alphabetically maybe getting sidetracked that was fun
nowadays there are hundreds of links to choose from
i can go literally anywhere in the world i think since i was already in ecuador i just decided to click on the word tropical
that took me to this wet and warm band of the tropics that encircles the earth
now thats the tropic of cancer in the north and the tropic of capricorn in the south that much i knew but i was surprised to learn this little fact those are not cartographers lines like latitude or the borders between nations they are astronomical phenomena caused by the earths tilt and they change
they move they go up they go down
in fact for years the tropic of cancer and the tropic of capricorn have been steadily drifting towards the equator at the rate of about meters per year and nobody told me that
i didnt know it
chimborazo
so to keep the game going i just have to find another term and look that one up
since im already in the tropics i chose tropical rainforest
famous for its diversity human diversity
there are still dozens and dozens of uncontacted tribes living on this planet
theyre all over the globe but virtually all of them live in tropical rainforests
this is the only place you can go nowadays and not get friended
the link that i clicked on here was exotic in the beginning and then absolutely mysterious at the very end
it mentioned leopards and ring tailed coatis and poison dart frogs and boa constrictors and then coleoptera which turn out to be beetles
now i clicked on this on purpose but if id somehow gotten here by mistake it does remind me for the band see the beatles for the car see volkswagon beetle but i am here for beetle beetles
this is the most successful order on the planet by far
something between and percent of all life forms on the planet including plants are beetles
that means the next time you are in the grocery store take a look at the four people ahead of you in line
statistically one of you is a beetle
and if it is you you are astonishingly well adapted
there are scavenger beetles that pick the skin and flesh off of bones in museums
there are predator beetles that attack other insects and still look pretty cute to us
there are beetles that roll little balls of dung great distances across the desert floor to feed to their hatchlings
this reminded the ancient egyptians of their god khepri who renews the ball of the sun every morning which is how that dung rolling scarab became that sacred scarab on the breastplate of the pharaoh tutankhamun
beetles i was reminded have the most romantic flirtation in the animal kingdom
fireflies are not flies fireflies are beetles
fireflies are coleoptera and coleoptera communicate in other ways as well
like my next link the chemical language of pheromones
now the pheromone page took me to a video of a sea urchin having sex
yeah
and the link to aphrodisiac
now thats something that increases sexual desire possibly chocolate
there is a compound in chocolate called phenethylamine that might be an aphrodisiac
but as the article mentions because of enzyme breakdown its unlikely that phenethylamine will reach your brain if taken orally
so those of you who only eat your chocolate you might have to experiment
the link i clicked on here sympathetic magic mostly because i understand what both of those words mean
but not when theyre together like that
i do like sympathy i do like magic
so when i click on sympathetic magic i get sympathetic magic and voodoo dolls
this is the boy in me getting lucky again
sympathetic magic is imitation
if you imitate something maybe you can have an effect on it
thats the idea behind voodoo dolls and possibly also cave paintings
the link to cave paintings takes me to some of the oldest art known to humankind
i would love to see google maps inside some of these caves
weve got tens of thousands years old artwork
common themes around the globe include large wild animals and tracings of human hands usually the left hand
we have been a dominantly right handed tribe for millenia so even though i dont know why a paleolithic person would trace his hand or blow pigment on it from a tube i can easily picture how he did it
and i really dont think its that different form our own little dominant hand avatar right there that im going to use now to click on the term for hand go to the page for hand where i found the most fun and possibly embarrassing bit of trivia ive found in a long time its simply this the back of the hand is formally called the opisthenar
now thats embarrassing because up until now every time ive said i know it like the back of my hand ive really been saying im totally familiar with that i just dont know its freaking name right
and the link i clicked on here well lemurs monkeys and chimpanzees have the little opisthenar
i click on chimpanzee and i get our closest genetic relative
pan troglodytes the name we give him means cave dweller
he doesnt
he lives in rainforests and savannas
its just that were always thinking of this guy as lagging behind us evolutionarily or somehow uncannily creeping up on us and in some cases he gets places before us
like my next link the almost irresistible link ham the astrochimp
i click on him and i really thought he was going to bring me full circle twice in fact
hes born in cameroon which is smack in the middle of my tropics map and more specifically his skeleton wound up in the smithsonian museum getting picked clean by beetles
in between those two landmarks in hams life he flew into space
he experienced weightlessness and re entry months before the first human being to do it soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin
when i click on yuri gagarins page i get this guy who was surprisingly short in stature huge in heroism
top estimates soviet estimates put this guy at meters that is less than five and a half feet tall max possibly because he was malnourished as a child
germans occupied russia
a nazi officer took over the gagarin household and he and his family built and lived in a mud hut
years later the boy from that cramped mud hut would grow up to be the man in that cramped capsule on the tip of a rocket who volunteered to be launched into outer space the first one of any of us to really physically leave this planet
and he didnt just leave it he circled it once
fifty years later as a tribute the international space station which is still up there tonight synced its orbit with gagarins orbit at the exact same time of day and filmed it so you can go online and you can watch over minutes of what must have been an absolutely mesmerizing ride possibly a lonely one the first person to ever see such a thing
and then when youve had your fill of that you can click on one more link
you can come back to earth
you return to where you started
you can finish your game
you just need to find one more fact that you didnt know
and for me i quickly landed on this one the earth has a tolerance of about percent from the reference spheroid which is less than the percent allowed in billiard balls
this is the kind of fact i would have loved as a boy
i found it myself
its got some math that i can do
im pretty sure my dad doesnt know it
what this means is that if you could shrink the earth to the size of a billiard ball if you could take planet earth with all its mountain tops and caves and rainforests astronauts and uncontacted tribes and chimpanzees voodoo dolls fireflies chocolate sea creatures making love in the deep blue sea you just shrink that to the size of a billiard ball it would be as smooth as a billiard ball presumably a billiard ball with a slight bulge around the middle
thats pretty cool
i didnt know that
chimborazo

title lemn sissay a child of the state title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript literature has long been fascinated with fostered adopted and orphaned children from moses to cinderella to oliver twist to harry potter so why do many parentless children feel compelled to hide their pasts poet and playwright lemn sissay tells his own moving story description
having spent years as a child of the state in childrens homes and foster care you could say that im an expert on the subject and in being an expert i want to let you know that being an expert does in no way make you right in light of the truth
if youre in care legally the government is your parent loco parentis
margaret thatcher was my mother
lets not talk about breastfeeding
harry potter was a foster child
pip from great expectations was adopted superman was a foster child cinderella was a foster child lisbeth salander the girl with the dragon tattoo was fostered and institutionalized batman was orphaned lyra belacqua from philip pullmans northern lights was fostered jane eyre adopted roald dahls james from james and the giant peach matilda moses moses
moses the boys in michael morpurgos friend or foe alem in benjamin zephaniahs refugee boy luke skywalker luke skywalker oliver twist cassia in the concubine of shanghai by hong ying celie in alice walkers the color purple
all of these great fictional characters all of them who were hurt by their condition all of them who spawned thousands of other books and other films all of them were fostered adopted or orphaned
it seems that writers know that the child outside of family reflects on what family truly is more than what it promotes itself to be
that is they also use extraordinary skills to deal with extraordinary situations on a daily basis
how have we not made the connection
and why have we not made the connection between how has that happened between these incredible characters of popular culture and religions and the fostered adopted or orphaned child in our midst its not our pity that they need
its our respect
i know famous musicians i know actors and film stars and millionaires and novelists and top lawyers and television executives and magazine editors and national journalists and dustbinmen and hairdressers all who were looked after children fostered adopted or orphaned and many of them grow into their adult lives in fear of speaking of their background as if it may somehow weaken their standing in the foreground as if it were somehow kryptonite as if it were a time bomb strapped on the inside children in care whove had a life in care deserve the right to own and live the memory of their own childhood
it is that simple
my own mother and i should say this here she same to this country in the late and she was you know she found herself pregnant as women did in the late you know what i mean
they found themselves pregnant
and she sort of she had no idea of the context in which shed landed
in the i should give you some context in the if you were pregnant and you were single you were seen as a threat to the community
you were separated from your family by the state
you were separated from your family and placed into mother and baby homes
you were appointed a social worker
the adoptive parents were lined up
it was the primary purpose of the social worker the aim to get the woman at her most vulnerable time in her entire life to sign the adoption papers
so the adoption papers were signed
the mother and babys homes were often run by nuns
the adoption papers were signed the child was given to the adoptive parents and the mother shipped back to her community to say that shed been on a little break
a little break
a little break
the first secret of shame for a woman for being a woman a little break
the adoption process took like a matter of months so it was a closed shop you know sealed deal an industrious utilitarian solution the government the farmer the adopting parents the consumer the mother the earth and the child the crop
its kind of easy to patronize the past to forego our responsibilities in the present
what happened then is a direct reflection of what is happening now everybody believed themselves to be doing the right thing by god and by the state for the big society fast tracking adoption
so anyway she comes here shes pregnant and she comes from ethiopia that was celebrating its own jubilee at the time under the emperor haile selassie and she lands months before the enoch powell speech the rivers of blood speech
she lands months before the beatles release the white album months before martin luther king was killed
it was a summer of love if you were white
if you were black it was a summer of hate
so she goes from oxford shes sent to the north of england to a mother and baby home and appointed a social worker
its her plan you know i have to say this in the houses its her plan to have me fostered for a short period of time while she studies but the social worker he had a different agenda
he found the foster parents and he said to them treat this as an adoption hes yours forever
his name is norman
norman
norman
so they took me i was a message they said
i was a sign from god they said
i was norman mark greenwood
now for the next years all i know is that this woman this birth woman should have her eyes scratched out for not signing the adoption papers she was an evil woman too selfish to sign so i spent those years kneeling and praying
i tried praying i swear i tried praying
god can i have a bike for christmas
but i would always answer myself yes of course you can
and then i was supposed to determine whether that was the voice of god or it was the voice of the devil
and it turns out ive got the devil inside of me
who knew
so anyway two years sort of passed and they had a child of their own and then another two years passed and they had another child of their own and then another time passed and they had another child that they called an accident which i thought was an unusual name
and i was on the cusp of sort of adolescence so i was starting to take biscuits from the tin without asking
i was starting to stay out a little bit late etc etc
now in their religiosity in their naivete my mom and dad which i believed them to be forever as they said they were my mom and dad conceived that i had the devil inside of me
and what i should say this here because this is how they engineered my leaving
they sat me at a table my foster mom and she said to me you dont love us do you at years old
theyve had three other children im the fourth the third was an accident
and i said yeah of course i do because you do
my foster mother asked me to go away to think about love and what it is and to read the scriptures and to come back tomorrow and give my most honest and truthful answer
so this was an opportunity if they were asking me whether i loved them or not then i mustnt love them which led me to the miracle of thought that i thought they wanted me to get to
i will ask god for forgiveness and his light will shine through me to them how fantastic this was an opportunity
the theology was perfect the timing unquestionable and the answer as honest as a sinner could get
i mustnt love you i said to them but i will ask god for forgiveness
because you dont love us norman clearly youve chosen your path
twenty four hours later my social worker this strange man who used to visit me every couple of months hes waiting for me in the car as i say goodbye to my parents
i didnt say goodbye to anybody not my mother my father my sisters my brothers my aunts my uncles my cousins my grandparents nobody
on the way to the childrens home i started to ask myself whats happened to me
its not that id had the rug pulled from beneath me as much as the entire floor had been taken away
when i got to the for the next four five years i was held in four different childrens homes
on the third childrens home at i started to rebel and what i did was i got three tins of paint airfix paint that you use for models and i was it was a big childrens home big victorian childrens home and i was in a little turret at the top of it and i poured them red yellow and green the colors of africa down the tiles
you couldnt see it from the street because the home was surrounded by beech trees
for doing this i was incarcerated for a year in an assessment center which was actually a remand center it was a virtual prison for young people
by the way years later my social worker said that i should never have been put in there
i wasnt charged for anything i hadnt done anything wrong
but because i had no family to inquire about me they could do anything to me
im years old and they had a padded cell
they would march me down corridors in last size order
they i was put in a dormitory with a confirmed nazi sympathizer
all of the staff were ex police interesting and ex probation officers
the man who ran it was an ex army officer
every time i had a visit by a person who i did not know who would feed me grapes once every three months i was strip searched
that home was full of young boys who were on remand for things like murder
and this was the preparation that i was being given after years as a child of the state
i have to tell this story
i have to tell it because there was no one to put two and two together
i slowly became aware that i knew nobody that knew me for longer than a year
see thats what family does
it gives you reference points
im not defining a good family from a bad family
im just saying that you know when your birthday is by virtue of the fact that somebody tells you when your birthday is a mother a father a sister a brother an aunt an uncle a cousin a grandparent it matters to someone and therefore it matters to you understand i was years old tucked away in myself into myself and i wasnt touched either physically touched
im reporting back im reporting back simply to say that when i left the childrens home i had two things that i wanted to do one was to find my family and the other was to write poetry
in creativity i saw light
in the imagination i saw the endless possibility of life the endless truth the permanent creation of reality the place where anger was an expression in the search for love a place where dysfunction is a true reaction to untruth
ive just got to say it to you all i found all of my family in my adult life i spent all of my adult life finding them and ive now got a fully dysfunctional family just like everybody else
but im reporting back to you to say quite simply that you can define how strong a democracy is by how its government treats its child
i dont mean children i mean the child of the state
thanks very much its been an honor

title michael merzenich growing evidence of brain plasticity title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript neuroscientist michael merzenich looks at one of the secrets of the brains incredible power its ability to actively re wire itself hes researching ways to harness the brains plasticity to enhance our skills and recover lost function description
this machine which we all have residing in our skulls reminds me of an aphorism of a comment of woody allen to ask about what is the very best thing to have within your skull
and its this machine
and its constructed for change its all about change
it confers on us the ability to do things tomorrow that we cant do today things today that we couldnt do yesterday
and of course its born stupid
the last time you were in the presence of a baby this happens to be my granddaughter mitra
isnt she fabulous
but nonetheless when she popped out despite the fact that her brain had actually been progressing in its development for several months before on the basis of her experiences in the womb nonetheless she had very limited abilities as does every infant at the time of normal natural full term birth
if we were to assay her perceptual abilities they would be crude
there is no real indication that there is any real thinking going on
in fact there is little evidence that there is any cognitive ability in a very young infant
infants dont respond to much
there is not really much of an indication in fact that there is a person on board
and they can only in a very primitive way and in a very limited way control their movements
it would be several months before this infant could do something as simple as reach out and grasp under voluntary control an object and retrieve it usually to the mouth
and it will be some months beforeward and we see a long steady progression of the evolution from the first wiggles to rolling over and sitting up and crawling standing walking before we get to that magical point in which we can motate in the world
and yet when we look forward in the brain we see really remarkable advance
by this age the brain can actually store
it has stored recorded can fastly retrieve the meanings of thousands tens of thousands of objects actions and their relationships in the world
and those relationships can in fact be constructed in hundreds of thousands potentially millions of ways
by this age the brain controls very refined perceptual abilities
and it actually has a growing repertoire of cognitive skills
this brain is very much a thinking machine
and by this age there is absolutely no question that this brain it has a person on board
and in fact at this age it is substantially controlling its own self development
and by this age we see a remarkable evolution in its capacity to control movement
now movement has advanced to the point where it can actually control movement simultaneously in a complex sequence in complex ways as would be required for example for playing a complicated game like soccer
now this boy can bounce a soccer ball on his head
and where this boy comes from sao paulo brazil about percent of boys of his age have this ability
you could go out into the community in monterey and youd have difficulty finding a boy that has this ability
and if you did hed probably be from sao paulo
thats all another way of saying that our individual skills and abilities are very much shaped by our environments
that environment extends into our contemporary culture the thing our brain is challenged with
because what weve done in our personal evolutions is build up a large repertoire of specific skills and abilities that are specific to our own individual histories
and in fact they result in a wonderful differentiation in humankind in the way that in fact no two of us are quite alike
every one of us has a different set of acquired skills and abilities that all derive out of the plasticity the adaptability of this really remarkable adaptive machine
in an adult brain of course weve built up a large repertoire of mastered skills and abilities that we can perform more or less automatically from memory and that define us as acting moving thinking creatures
now we study this as the nerdy laboratory university based scientists that we are by engaging the brains of animals like rats or monkeys or of this particularly curious creature one of the more bizarre forms of life on earth to engage them in learning new skills and abilities
and we try to track the changes that occur as the new skill or ability is acquired
in fact we do this in individuals of any age in these different species that is to say from infancies infancy up to adulthood and old age
so we might engage a rat for example to acquire a new skill or ability that might involve the rat using its paw to master particular manual grasp behaviors just like we might examine a child and their ability to acquire the sub skills or the general overall skill of accomplishing something like mastering the ability to read
or you might look in an older individual who has mastered a complex set of abilities that might relate to reading musical notation or performing the mechanical acts of performance that apply to musical performance
from these studies we defined two great epochs of the plastic history of the brain
the first great epoch is commonly called the critical period
and that is the period in which the brain is setting up in its initial form its basic processing machinery
this is actually a period of dramatic change in which it doesnt take learning per se to drive the initial differentiation of the machinery of the brain
all it takes for example in the sound domain is exposure to sound
and the brain actually is at the mercy of the sound environment in which it is reared
so for example i can rear an animal in an environment in which there is meaningless dumb sound a repertoire of sound that i make up that i make just by exposure artificially important to the animal and its young brain
and what i see is that the animals brain sets up its initial processing of that sound in a form thats idealized within the limits of its processing achievements to represent it in an organized and orderly way
the sound doesnt have to be valuable to the animal i could raise the animal in something that could be hypothetically valuable like the sounds that simulate the sounds of a native language of a child
and i see the brain actually develop a processor that is specialized specialized for that complex array a repertoire of sounds
it actually exaggerates their separateness of representation in multi dimensional neuronal representational terms
or i can expose the animal to a completely meaningless and destructive sound
i can raise an animal under conditions that would be equivalent to raising a baby under a moderately loud ceiling fan in the presence of continuous noise
and when i do that i actually specialize the brain to be a master processor for that meaningless sound
and i frustrate its ability to represent any meaningful sound as a consequence
such things in the early history of babies occur in real babies
and they account for for example the beautiful evolution of a language specific processor in every normally developing baby
and so they also account for development of defective processing in a substantial population of children who are more limited as a consequence in their language abilities at an older age
now in this early period of plasticity the brain actually changes outside of a learning context
i dont have to be paying attention to what i hear
the input doesnt really have to be meaningful
i dont have to be in a behavioral context
this is required so the brain sets up its processing so that it can act differentially so that it can act selectively so that the creature that wears it that carries it can begin to operate on it in a selective way
in the next great epoch of life which applies for most of life the brain is actually refining its machinery as it masters a wide repertoire of skills and abilities
and in this epoch which extends from late in the first year of life to death its actually doing this under behavioral control
and thats another way of saying the brain has strategies that define the significance of the input to the brain
and its focusing on skill after skill or ability after ability under specific attentional control
its a function of whether a goal in a behavior is achieved or whether the individual is rewarded in the behavior
this is actually very powerful
this lifelong capacity for plasticity for brain change is powerfully expressed
it is the basis of our real differentiation one individual from another
you can look down in the brain of an animal thats engaged in a specific skill and you can witness or document this change on a variety of levels
so here is a very simple experiment
it was actually conducted about five years ago in collaboration with scientists from the university of provence in marseilles
its a very simple experiment where a monkey has been trained in a task that involves it manipulating a tool thats equivalent in its difficulty to a child learning to manipulate or handle a spoon
the monkey actually mastered the task in about practice tries
so in the beginning the monkey could not perform this task at all
it had a success rate of about one in eight tries
those tries were elaborate
each attempt was substantially different from the other
but the monkey gradually developed a strategy
and or so tries later the monkey is performing it flawlessly never fails
hes successful in his retrieval of food with this tool every time
at this point the task is being performed in a beautifully stereotyped way very beautifully regulated and highly repeated trial to trial
we can look down in the brain of the monkey
and we see that its distorted
we can track these changes and have tracked these changes in many such behaviors across time
and here we see the distortion reflected in the map of the skin surfaces of the hand of the monkey
now this is a map down in the surface of the brain in which in a very elaborate experiment weve reconstructed the responses location by location in a highly detailed response mapping of the responses of its neurons
we see here a reconstruction of how the hand is represented in the brain
weve actually distorted the map by the exercise
and that is indicated in the pink we have a couple fingertip surfaces that are larger
these are the surfaces the monkey is using to manipulate the tool
if we look at the selectivity of responses in the cortex of the monkey we see that the monkey has actually changed the filter characteristics which represents input from the skin of the fingertips that are engaged
in other words there is still a single simple representation of the fingertips in this most organized of cortical areas of the surface of the skin of the body
monkey has like you have
and yet now its represented in substantially finer grain
the monkey is getting more detailed information from these surfaces
and that is an unknown unsuspected maybe by you part of acquiring the skill or ability
now actually weve looked in several different cortical areas in the monkey learning this task
and each one of them changes in ways that are specific to the skill or ability
so for example we can look to the cortical area that represents input thats controlling the posture of the monkey
we look in cortical areas that control specific movements and the sequences of movements that are required in the behavior and so forth
they are all remodeled they all become specialized for the task at hand
there are or cortical areas that are changed specifically when you learn a simple skill like this
and that represents in your brain really massive change
it represents the change in a reliable way of the responses of tens of millions possibly hundreds of millions of neurons in your brain
it represents changes of hundreds of millions possibly billions of synaptic connections in your brain
this is constructed by physical change
and the level of construction that occurs is massive
think about the changes that occur in the brain of a child through the course of acquiring their movement behavior abilities in general
or acquiring their native language abilities
the changes are massive
what its all about is the selective representations of things that are important to the brain
because in most of the life of the brain this is under control of behavioral context
its what you pay attention to
its whats rewarding to you
its what the brain regards itself as positive and important to you
its all about cortical processing and forebrain specialization
and that underlies your specialization
that is why you in your many skills and abilities are a unique specialist a specialist thats vastly different in your physical brain in detail than the brain of an individual years ago enormously different in the details from the brain of the average individual years ago
now one of the characteristics of this change process is that information is always related to other inputs or information that is occurring in immediate time in context
and thats because the brain is constructing representations of things that are correlated in little moments of time and that relate to one another in little moments of successive time
the brain is recording all information and driving all change in temporal context
now overwhelmingly the most powerful context thats occurred in your brain is you
billions of events have occurred in your history that are related in time to yourself as the receiver or yourself as the actor yourself as the thinker yourself as the mover
billions of times little pieces of sensation have come in from the surface of your body that are always associated with you as the receiver and that result in the embodiment of you
you are constructed your self is constructed from these billions of events
its constructed its created in your brain
and its created in the brain via physical change
this is a marvelously constructed thing that results in individual form because each one of us has vastly different histories and vastly different experiences that drive in to us this marvelous differentiation of self of personhood
now weve used this research to try to understand not just how a normal person develops and elaborates their skills and abilities but also try to understand the origins of impairment and the origins of differences or variations that might limit the capacities of a child or an adult
im going to talk about using these strategies to actually design brain plasticity based approach to drive corrections in the machinery of a child that increases the competence of the child as a language receiver and user and thereafter as a reader
and im going to talk about experiments that involve actually using this brain science first of all to understand how it contributes to the loss of function as we age
and then by using it in a targeted approach were going to try to differentiate the machinery to recover function in old age
so the first example im going to talk about relates to children with learning impairments
we now have a large body of literature that demonstrates that the fundamental problem that occurs in the majority of children that have early language impairments and that are going to struggle to learn to read is that their language processor is created in a defective form
and the reason that it rises in a defective form is because early in the babys brains life the machine process is noisy
its that simple
its a signal to noise problem okay
and there are a lot of things that contribute to that
there are numerous inherited faults that could make the machine process noisier
now i might say the noise problem could also occur on the basis of information provided in the world from the ears
if any those of you who are older in the audience know that when i was a child we understood that a child born with a cleft palate was born with what we called mental retardation
we knew that they were going to be slow cognitively we knew they were going to struggle to learn to develop normal language abilities and we knew that they were going to struggle to learn to read
most of them would be intellectual and academic failures
thats disappeared that no longer applies
that inherited weakness that inherited condition has evaporated
we dont hear about that anymore where did it go
well it was understood by a dutch surgeon about years ago that if you simply fix the problem early enough when the brain is still in this initial plastic period so it can set up this machinery adequately in this initial set up time in the critical period none of that happens
what are you doing by operating on the cleft palate to correct it
youre basically opening up the tubes that drain fluid from the middle ears which have had them reliably full
every sound the child hears uncorrected is muffled
its degraded
the childs native language is such a case is not english
its not japanese
its muffled english its degraded japanese
its crap
and the brain specializes for it
it creates a representation of language crap
and then the child is stuck with it
now the crap doesnt just happen in the ear
it can also happen in the brain
the brain itself can be noisy its commonly noisy
there are many inherited faults that can make it noisier
and the native language for a child with such a brain is degraded
its not english its noisy english
and that results in defective representations of sounds of words not normal a different strategy by a machine that has different time constants and different space constants
and you can look in the brain of such a child and record those time constants
they are about an order of magnitude longer about times longer in duration on average than in a normal child
space constants are about three times greater
such a child will have memory and cognitive deficits in this domain
of course they will because as a receiver of language they are receiving it and representing it and in information its representing crap
and they are going to have poor reading skills
because reading is dependent upon the translation of word sounds into this orthographic or visual representational form
if you dont have a brain representation of word sounds that translation makes no sense
and you are going to have corresponding abnormal neurology
then these children increasingly in evaluation after evaluation in their operations in language and their operations in reading we document that abnormal neurology
the point is is that you can train the brain out of this
a way to think about this is you can actually re refine the processing capacity of the machinery by changing it
changing it in detail it takes about hours on the average
and weve accomplished that in about kids today
actually probably about children are being trained as we speak
and actually when you look at the impacts the impacts are substantial
so here were looking at the normal distribution
what were most interested in is these kids on the left side of the distribution
this is from about children
you can see that most of the children on the left side of the distribution are moving into the middle or the right
this is in a broad assessment of their language abilities
this is like an iq test for language
the impact in the distribution if you trained every child in the united states would be to shift the whole distribution to the right and narrow the distribution
this is a substantially large impact
think of a classroom of children in the language arts
think of the children on the slow side of the class
we have the potential to move most of those children to the middle or to the right side
in addition to accurate language training it also fixes memory and cognition speech fluency and speech production
and an important language dependent skill is enabled by this training that is to say reading
and to a large extent it fixes the brain
you can look down in the brain of a child in a variety of tasks that scientists have at stanford and mit and ucsf and ucla and a number of other institutions
and children operating in various language behaviors or in various reading behaviors you see for the most extent for most children their neuronal responses complexly abnormal before you start are normalized by the training
now you can also take the same approach to address problems in aging
where again the machinery is deteriorating now from competent machinery its going south
noise is increasing in the brain
and learning modulation and control is deteriorating
and you can actually look down on the brain of such an individual and witness a change in the time constants and space constants with which for example the brain is representing language again
just as the brain came out of chaos at the beginning its going back into chaos in the end
this results in declines in memory in cognition and in postural ability and agility
it turns out you can train the brain of such an individual this is a small population of such individuals train equally intensively for about hours
these are to year olds
and what you see are substantial improvements of their immediate memory of their ability to remember things after a delay of their ability to control their attention their language abilities and visual spatial abilities
the overall neuropsychological index of these trained individuals in this population is about two standard deviations
that means that if you sit at the left side of the distribution and im looking at your neuropyschological abilities the average person has moved to the middle or the right side of the distribution
it means that most people who are at risk for senility more or less immediately are now in a protected position
my issues are to try to get to rescuing older citizens more completely and in larger numbers because i think this can be done in this arena on a vast scale and the same for kids
my main interest is how to elaborate this science to address other maladies
im specifically interested in things like autism and cerebral palsy these great childhood catastrophes
and in older age conditions like parkinsonism and in other acquired impairments like schizophrenia
your issues as it relates to this science is how to maintain your own high functioning learning machine
and of course a well ordered life in which learning is a continuous part of it is key
but also in your future is brain aerobics
get ready for it its going to be a part of every life not too far in the future just like physical exercise is a part of every well organized life in the contemporary period
the other way that we will ultimately come to consider this literature and the science that is important to you is in a consideration of how to nurture yourself
now that you know now that science is telling us that you are in charge that its under your control that your happiness your well being your abilities your capacities are capable of continuous modification continuous improvement and youre the responsible agent and party
of course a lot of people will ignore this advice
it will be a long time before they really understand it
now thats another issue and not my fault
okay thank you

title fiorenzo omenetto silk the ancient material of the future title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript fiorenzo omenetto shares astonishing new uses for silk one of natures most elegant materials in transmitting light improving sustainability adding strength and making medical leaps and bounds on stage he shows a few intriguing items made of the versatile stuff description
thank you
im thrilled to be here
im going to talk about a new old material that still continues to amaze us and that might impact the way we think about material science high technology and maybe along the way also do some stuff for medicine and for global health and help reforestation
so thats kind of a bold statement
ill tell you a little bit more
this material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true
its sustainable its a sustainable material that is processed all in water and at room temperature and is biodegradable with a clock so you can watch it dissolve instantaneously in a glass of water or have it stable for years
its edible its implantable in the human body without causing any immune response
it actually gets reintegrated in the body
and its technological so it can do things like microelectronics and maybe photonics do
and the material looks something like this
in fact this material you see is clear and transparent
the components of this material are just water and protein
so this material is silk
so its kind of different from what were used to thinking about silk
so the question is how do you reinvent something that has been around for five millennia
the process of discovery generally is inspired by nature
and so we marvel at silk worms the silk worm you see here spinning its fiber
the silk worm does a remarkable thing it uses these two ingredients protein and water that are in its gland to make a material that is exceptionally tough for protection so comparable to technical fibers like kevlar
and so in the reverse engineering process that we know about and that were familiar with for the textile industry the textile industry goes and unwinds the cocoon and then weaves glamorous things
we want to know how you go from water and protein to this liquid kevlar to this natural kevlar
so the insight is how do you actually reverse engineer this and go from cocoon to gland and get water and protein that is your starting material
and this is an insight that came about two decades ago from a person that im very fortunate to work with david kaplan
and so we get this starting material
and so this starting material is back to the basic building block
and then we use this to do a variety of things like for example this film
and we take advantage of something that is very simple
the recipe to make those films is to take advantage of the fact that proteins are extremely smart at what they do
they find their way to self assemble
so the recipe is simple you take the silk solution you pour it and you wait for the protein to self assemble
and then you detach the protein and you get this film as the proteins find each other as the water evaporates
but i mentioned that the film is also technological
and so what does that mean
it means that you can interface it with some of the things that are typical of technology like microelectronics and nanoscale technology
and the image of the dvd here is just to illustrate a point that silk follows very subtle topographies of the surface which means that it can replicate features on the nanoscale
so it would be able to replicate the information that is on the dvd
and we can store information thats film with water and protein
so we tried something out and we wrote a message in a piece of silk which is right here and the message is over there
and much like in the dvd you can read it out optically
and this requires a stable hand so this is why i decided to do it onstage in front of a thousand people
so let me see
so as you see the film go in transparently through there and then
and the most remarkable feat is that my hand actually stayed still long enough to do that
so once you have these attributes of this material then you can do a lot of things
its actually not limited to films
and so the material can assume a lot of formats
and then you go a little crazy and so you do various optical components or you do microprism arrays like the reflective tape that you have on your running shoes
or you can do beautiful things that if the camera can capture you can make
you can add a third dimensionality to the film
and if the angle is right you can actually see a hologram appear in this film of silk
but you can do other things
you can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light and so weve made optical fibers
but silk is versatile and it goes beyond optics
and you can think of different formats
so for instance if youre afraid of going to the doctor and getting stuck with a needle we do microneedle arrays
what you see there on the screen is a human hair superimposed on the needle thats made of silk just to give you a sense of size
you can do bigger things
you can do gears and nuts and bolts that you can buy at whole foods
and the gears work in water as well
so you think of alternative mechanical parts
and maybe you can use that liquid kevlar if you need something strong to replace peripheral veins for example or maybe an entire bone
and so you have here a little example of a small skull what we call mini yorick
but you can do things like cups for example and so if you add a little bit of gold if you add a little bit of semiconductors you could do sensors that stick on the surfaces of foods
you can do electronic pieces that fold and wrap
or if youre fashion forward some silk led tattoos
so theres versatility as you see in the material formats that you can do with silk
but there are still some unique traits
i mean why would you want to do all these things for real
i mentioned it briefly at the beginning the protein is biodegradable and biocompatible
and you see here a picture of a tissue section
and so what does that mean that its biodegradable and biocompatible
you can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted
which means that all the devices that youve seen before and all the formats in principle can be implanted and disappear
and what you see there in that tissue section in fact is you see that reflector tape
so much like youre seen at night by a car then the idea is that you can see if you illuminate tissue you can see deeper parts of tissue because there is that reflective tape there that is made out of silk
and you see there it gets reintegrated in tissue
and reintegration in the human body is not the only thing but reintegration in the environment is important
so you have a clock you have protein and now a silk cup like this can be thrown away without guilt unlike the polystyrene cups that unfortunately fill our landfills everyday
its edible so you can do smart packaging around food that you can cook with the food
it doesnt taste good so im going to need some help with that
but probably the most remarkable thing is that it comes full circle
silk during its self assembly process acts like a cocoon for biological matter
and so if you change the recipe and you add things when you pour so you add things to your liquid silk solution where these things are enzymes or antibodies or vaccines the self assembly process preserves the biological function of these dopants
so it makes the materials environmentally active and interactive
so that screw that you thought about beforehand can actually be used to screw a bone together a fractured bone together and deliver drugs at the same while your bone is healing for example
or you could put drugs in your wallet and not in your fridge
so weve made a silk card with penicillin in it
and we stored penicillin at degrees c so degrees fahrenheit for two months without loss of efficacy of the penicillin
and so that could be that could be potentially a good alternative to solar powered refrigerated camels
and of course theres no use in storage if you cant use
and so there is this other unique material trait that these materials have that theyre programmably degradable
and so what you see there is the difference
in the top you have a film that has been programmed not to degrade and in the bottom a film that has been programmed to degrade in water
and what you see is that the film on the bottom releases what is inside it
so it allows for the recovery of what weve stored before
and so this allows for a controlled delivery of drugs and for reintegration in the environment in all of these formats that youve seen
so the thread of discovery that we have really is a thread
were impassioned with this idea that whatever you want to do whether you want to replace a vein or a bone or maybe be more sustainable in microelectronics perhaps drink a coffee in a cup and throw it away without guilt maybe carry your drugs in your pocket deliver them inside your body or deliver them across the desert the answer may be in a thread of silk
thank you

title jonathan haidt how common threats can make common ground title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript if an asteroid were headed for earth wed all band together and figure out how to stop it just like in the movies right and yet when faced with major data supported end of the world problems in real life too often we retreat into partisan shouting and stalemate jonathan haidt shows us a few of the very real asteroids headed our way some pet causes of the left wing some of the right and suggests how both wings could work together productively to benefit humanity as a whole description
so if youve been following the news youve heard that theres a pack of giant asteroids headed for the united states all scheduled to strike within the next years
now i dont mean actual asteroids made of rock and metal
that actually wouldnt be such a problem because if we were really all going to die we would put aside our differences wed spend whatever it took and wed find a way to deflect them
im talking instead about threats that are headed our way but theyre wrapped in a special energy field that polarizes us and therefore paralyzes us
last march i went to the ted conference and i saw jim hansen speak the nasa scientist who first raised the alarm about global warming in the and it seems that the predictions he made back then are coming true
this is where were headed in terms of global temperature rises and if we keep on going the way were going we get a four or five degree centigrade temperature rise by the end of this century
hansen says we can expect about a five meter rise in sea levels
this is what a five meter rise in sea levels would look like
low lying cities all around the world will disappear within the lifetime of children born today
hansen closed his talk by saying imagine a giant asteroid on a collision course with earth
that is the equivalent of what we face now
yet we dither taking no action to deflect the asteroid even though the longer we wait the more difficult and expensive it becomes
of course the left wants to take action but the right denies that theres any problem
all right so i go back from ted and then the following week im invited to a dinner party in washington d c where i know that ill be meeting a number of conservative intellectuals including yuval levin and to prepare for the meeting i read this article by levin in national affairs called beyond the welfare state
levin writes that all over the world nations are coming to terms with the fact that the social democratic welfare state is turning out to be untenable and unaffordable dependent upon dubious economics and the demographic model of a bygone era
all right now this might not sound as scary as an asteroid but look at these graphs that levin showed
this graph shows the national debt as a percentage of americas gdp and as you see if you go all the way back to the founding we borrowed a lot of money to fight the revolutionary war
wars are expensive but then wed pay it off pay it off pay it off and then oh whats this the civil war even more expensive
borrow a lot of money pay it off pay it off pay it off get down to near zero and bang world war i
once again the same process repeats
now then we get the great depression and world war ii
we rise to an astronomical level around percent of gdp really unsustainable really dangerous
but we pay it off pay it off pay it off and then whats this
why has it been rising since the
its partly due to tax cuts that were unfunded but its due primarily to the rise of entitlement spending especially medicare
were approaching the levels of indebtedness we had at world war ii and the baby boomers havent even retired yet and when they do this is what will happen
this is data from the congressional budget office showing its most realistic forecast of what would happen if current situations and expectations and trends are extended
all right now what you might notice is that these two graphs are actually identical not in terms of the x and y axes or in terms of the data they present but in terms of their moral and political implications they say the same thing
let me translate for you
we are doomed unless we start acting now
whats wrong with you people on the other side in the other party
cant you see reality if you wont help then get the hell out of the way
we can deflect both of these asteroids
these problems are both technically solvable
our problem and our tragedy is that in these hyper partisan times the mere fact that one side says look theres an asteroid means that the other sides going to say huh what
no im not even going to look up no
to understand why this is happening to us and what we can do about it we need to learn more about moral psychology
so im a social psychologist and i study morality and one of the most important principles of morality is that morality binds and blinds
it binds us into teams that circle around sacred values but thereby makes us go blind to objective reality
think of it like this
large scale cooperation is extremely rare on this planet
there are only a few species that can do it
thats a beehive thats a termite mound a giant termite mound
and when you find this in other animals its always the same story
theyre always all siblings who are children of a single queen so theyre all in the same boat
they rise or fall they live or die as one
theres only one species on the planet that can do this without kinship and that of course is us
this is a reconstruction of ancient babylon and this is tenochtitlan
now how did we do this how did we go from being hunter gatherers years ago to building these gigantic cities in just a few thousand years
its miraculous and part of the explanation is this ability to circle around sacred values
as you see temples and gods play a big role in all ancient civilizations
this is an image of muslims circling the kaaba in mecca
its a sacred rock and when people circle something together they unite they can trust each other they become one
its as though youre moving an electrical wire through a magnetic field that generates current
when people circle together they generate a current
we love to circle around things
we circle around flags and then we can trust each other
we can fight as a team as a unit
but even as morality binds people together into a unit into a team the circling blinds them
it causes them to distort reality
we begin separating everything into good versus evil
now that process feels great it feels really satisfying
but it is a gross distortion of reality
you can see the moral electromagnet operating in the u s congress
this is a graph that shows the degree to which voting in congress falls strictly along the left right axis so that if you know how liberal or conservative someone is you know exactly how they voted on all the major issues
and what you can see is that in the decades after the civil war congress was extraordinarily polarized as you would expect about as high as can be
but then after world war i things dropped and we get this historically low level of polarization
this was a golden age of bipartisanship at least in terms of the parties ability to work together and solve grand national problems
but in the and the electromagnet turns back on
polarization rises
it used to be that conservatives and moderates and liberals could all work together in congress
they could rearrange themselves form bipartisan committees but as the moral electromagnet got cranked up the force field increased democrats and republicans were pulled apart
it became much harder for them to socialize much harder for them to cooperate
retiring members nowadays say that its become like gang warfare
did anybody notice that in two of the three debates obama wore a blue tie and romney wore a red tie
do you know why they do this
its so that the bloods and the crips will know which side to vote for
the polarization is strongest among our political elites
nobody doubts that this is happening in washington
but for a while there was some doubt as to whether it was happening among the people
well in the last years its become much more apparent that it is
so look at this data this is from the american national elections survey
and what they do on that survey is they ask whats called a feeling thermometer rating
so how warm or cold do you feel about you know native americans or the military the republican party the democratic party all sorts of groups in american life
the blue line shows how warmly democrats feel about democrats and they like them
you know ratings in the on a point scale
republicans like republicans thats not a surprise
but when you look at cross party ratings you find well that its lower but actually when i first saw this data i was surprised
thats actually not so bad if you go back to the carter and even reagan administrations they were rating the other party its not terrible
it drifts downwards very slightly but now look what happens under george w bush and obama
it plummets something is going on here
the moral electromagnet is turning back on and nowadays just very recently democrats really dislike republicans
republicans really dislike the democrats were changing
its as though the moral electromagnet is affecting us too
its like put out in the two oceans and its pulling the whole country apart pulling left and right into their own territories like the bloods and the crips
now there are many reasons why this is happening to us and many of them we cannot reverse
we will never again have a political class that was forged by the experience of fighting together in world war ii against a common enemy
we will never again have just three television networks all of which are relatively centrist
and we will never again have a large group of conservative southern democrats and liberal northern republicans making it easy making there be a lot of overlap for bipartisan cooperation
so for a lot of reasons those decades after the second world war were an historically anomalous time
we will never get back to those low levels of polarization i believe
but theres a lot that we can do there are dozens and dozens of reforms we can do that will make things better because a lot of our dysfunction can be traced directly to things that congress did to itself in the that created a much more polarized and dysfunctional institution
these changes are detailed in many books
these are two that i strongly recommend and they list a whole bunch of reforms
im just going to group them into three broad classes here
so if you think about this as the problem of a dysfunctional hyper polarized institution well the first step is do what you can so that fewer hyper partisans get elected in the first place and when you have closed party primaries and only the most committed republicans and democrats are voting youre nominating and selecting the most extreme hyper partisans
so open primaries would make that problem much much less severe
but the problem isnt primarily that were electing bad people to congress
from my experience and from what ive heard from congressional insiders most of the people going to congress are good hard working intelligent people who really want to solve problems but once they get there they find that they are forced to play a game that rewards hyper partisanship and that punishes independent thinking
you step out of line you get punished
so there are a lot of reforms we could do that will counteract this
for example this citizens united ruling is a disaster because it means theres like a money gun aimed at your head and if you step out of line if you try to reach across the aisle theres a ton of money waiting to be given to your opponent to make everybody think that you are a terrible person through negative advertising
but the third class of reforms is that weve got to change the nature of social relationships in congress
the politicians ive met are generally very extroverted friendly very socially skillful people and thats the nature of politics youve got to make relationships make deals youve got to cajole please flatter youve got to use your personal skills and thats the way politics has always worked
but beginning in the first the house of representatives changed its legislative calendar so that all business is basically done in the middle of the week
nowadays congressmen fly in on tuesday morning they do battle for two days then they fly home thursday afternoon
they dont move their families to the district
they dont meet each others spouses or children
theres no more relationship there
and trying to run congress without human relationships is like trying to run a car without motor oil
should we be surprised when the whole thing freezes up and descends into paralysis and polarization
a simple change to the legislative calendar such as having business stretch out for three weeks and then they get a week off to go home that would change the fundamental relationships in congress
so theres a lot we can do but whos going to push them to do it
there are a number of groups that are working on this
no labels and common cause i think have very good ideas for changes we need to do to make our democracy more responsive and our congress more effective
but id like to supplement their work with a little psychological trick and the trick is this
nothing pulls people together like a common threat or a common attack especially an attack from a foreign enemy unless of course that threat hits on our polarized psychology in which case as i said before it can actually pull us apart
sometimes a single threat can polarize us as we saw
but what if the situation we face is not a single threat but is actually more like this where theres just so much stuff coming in its just start shooting come on everybody weve got to just work together just start shooting
because actually we do face this situation
this is where we are as a country
so heres another asteroid
weve all seen versions of this graph right which shows the changes in wealth since and as you can see almost all the gains in wealth have gone to the top percent and especially the top one percent
rising inequality like this is associated with so many problems for a democracy
especially it destroys our ability to trust each other to feel that were all in the same boat because its obvious were not
some of us are sitting there safe and sound in gigantic private yachts
other people are clinging to a piece of driftwood
were not all in the same boat and that means nobodys willing to sacrifice for the common good
the left has been screaming about this asteroid for years now and the right says huh what hmm no problem no problem
now why is that happening to us why is the inequality rising
well one of the largest causes after globalization is actually this fourth asteroid rising non marital births
this graph shows the steady rise of out of wedlock births since the
most hispanic and black children are now born to unmarried mothers
whites are headed that way too
within a decade or two most american children will be born into homes with no father
this means that theres much less money coming into the house
but its not just money its also stability versus chaos
as i know from working with street children in brazil moms boyfriend is often a really really dangerous person for kids
now the right has been screaming about this asteroid since the and the left has been saying its not a problem its not a problem
the left has been very reluctant to say that marriage is actually good for women and for children
now let me be clear im not blaming the women here
im actually more critical of the men who wont take responsibility for their own children and of an economic system that makes it difficult for many men to earn enough money to support those children
but even if you blame nobody it still is a national problem and one side has been more concerned about it than the other
the new york times finally noticed this asteroid with a front page story last july showing how the decline of marriage contributes to inequality
we are becoming a nation of just two classes
when americans go to college and marry each other they have very low divorce rates
they earn a lot of money they invest that money in their kids some of them become tiger mothers the kids rise to their full potential and the kids go on to become the top two lines in this graph
and then theres everybody else the children who dont benefit from a stable marriage who dont have as much invested in them who dont grow up in a stable environment and who go on to become the bottom three lines in that graph
so once again we see that these two graphs are actually saying the same thing
as before weve got a problem weve got to start working on this weve got to do something and whats wrong with you people that you dont see my threat
but if everybody could just take off their partisan blinders wed see that these two problems actually are best addressed together
because if you really care about income inequality you might want to talk to some evangelical christian groups that are working on ways to promote marriage
but then youre going to run smack into the problem that women dont generally want to marry someone who doesnt have a job
so if you really care about strengthening families you might want to talk to some liberal groups who are working on promoting educational equality who are working on raising the minimum wage who are working on finding ways to stop so many men from being sucked into the criminal justice system and taken out of the marriage market for their whole lives
so to conclude there are at least four asteroids headed our way
how many of you can see all four
please raise your hand right now if youre willing to admit that all four of these are national problems
please raise your hands
okay almost all of you
well congratulations you guys are the inaugural members of the asteroids club which is a club for all americans who are willing to admit that the other side actually might have a point
in the asteroids club we dont start by looking for common ground
common ground is often very hard to find
no we start by looking for common threats because common threats make common ground
now am i being naive is it naive to think that people could ever lay down their swords and left and right could actually work together
i dont think so because it happens not all that often but there are a variety of examples that point the way
this is something we can do
because americans on both sides care about the decline in civility and theyve formed dozens of organizations at the national level such as this one down to many local organizations such as to the village square in tallahassee florida which tries to bring state leaders together to help facilitate that sort of working together human relationship thats necessary to solve floridas problems
americans on both sides care about global poverty and aids and on so many humanitarian issues liberals and evangelicals are actually natural allies and at times they really have worked together to solve these problems
and most surprisingly to me they sometimes can even see eye to eye on criminal justice
for example the incarceration rate the prison population in this country has quadrupled since
now this is a social disaster and liberals are very concerned about this
the southern poverty law center is often fighting the prison industrial complex fighting to prevent a system thats just sucking in more and more poor young men
but are conservatives happy about this
well grover norquist isnt because this system costs an unbelievable amount of money
and so because the prison industrial complex is bankrupting our states and corroding our souls groups of fiscal conservatives and christian conservatives have come together to form a group called right on crime
and at times they have worked with the southern poverty law center to oppose the building of new prisons and to work for reforms that will make the justice system more efficient and more humane
so this is possible we can do it
let us therefore go to battle stations not to fight each other but to begin deflecting these incoming asteroids
and let our first mission be to press congress to reform itself before its too late for our nation
thank you

title lee cronin print your own medicine title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript chemist lee cronin is working on a printer that instead of objects is able to print molecules an exciting potential long term application printing your own medicine using chemical inks description
organic chemists make molecules very complicated molecules by chopping up a big molecule into small molecules and reverse engineering
and as a chemist one of the things i wanted to ask my research group a couple of years ago is could we make a really cool universal chemistry set
in essence could we app chemistry
now what would this mean and how would we do it
we took a printer and we started to print our beakers and our test tubes on one side and then print the molecule at the same time on the other side and combine them together in what we call reactionware
and so by printing the vessel and doing the chemistry at the same time we may start to access this universal toolkit of chemistry
now what could this mean
well if we can embed biological and chemical networks like a search engine so if you have a cell thats ill that you need to cure or bacteria that you want to kill if you have this embedded in your device at the same time and you do the chemistry you may be able to make drugs in a new way
so how are we doing this in the lab
well it requires software it requires hardware and it requires chemical inks
and so the really cool bit is the idea is that we want to have a universal set of inks that we put out with the printer and you download the blueprint the organic chemistry for that molecule and you make it in the device
and so you can make your molecule in the printer using this software
so what could this mean
well ultimately it could mean that you could print your own medicine
and this is what were doing in the lab at the moment
but to take baby steps to get there first of all we want to look at drug design and production or drug discovery and manufacturing
because if we can manufacture it after weve discovered it we could deploy it anywhere
you dont need to go to the chemist anymore
we can print drugs at point of need
we can download new diagnostics
say a new super bug has emerged
you put it in your search engine and you create the drug to treat the threat
so this allows you on the fly molecular assembly
but perhaps for me the core bit going into the future is this idea of taking your own stem cells with your genes and your environment and you print your own personal medicine
and if that doesnt seem fanciful enough where do you think were going to go
well youre going to have your own personal matter fabricator
beam me up scotty

title eli pariser beware online filter bubbles title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript as web companies strive to tailor their services to our personal tastes theres a dangerous unintended consequence we get trapped in a filter bubble and dont get exposed to information that could challenge or broaden our worldview eli pariser argues powerfully that this will ultimately prove to be bad for us and bad for democracy description
mark zuckerberg a journalist was asking him a question about the news feed
and the journalist was asking him why is this so important
and zuckerberg said a squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in africa
and i want to talk about what a web based on that idea of relevance might look like
so when i was growing up in a really rural area in maine the internet meant something very different to me
it meant a connection to the world
it meant something that would connect us all together
and i was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society
but theres this shift in how information is flowing online and its invisible
and if we dont pay attention to it it could be a real problem
so i first noticed this in a place i spend a lot of time my facebook page
im progressive politically big surprise but ive always gone out of my way to meet conservatives
i like hearing what theyre thinking about i like seeing what they link to i like learning a thing or two
and so i was surprised when i noticed one day that the conservatives had disappeared from my facebook feed
and what it turned out was going on was that facebook was looking at which links i clicked on and it was noticing that actually i was clicking more on my liberal friends links than on my conservative friends links
and without consulting me about it it had edited them out
they disappeared
so facebook isnt the only place thats doing this kind of invisible algorithmic editing of the web
googles doing it too
if i search for something and you search for something even right now at the very same time we may get very different search results
even if youre logged out one engineer told me there are signals that google looks at everything from what kind of computer youre on to what kind of browser youre using to where youre located that it uses to personally tailor your query results
think about it for a second there is no standard google anymore
and you know the funny thing about this is that its hard to see
you cant see how different your search results are from anyone elses
but a couple of weeks ago i asked a bunch of friends to google egypt and to send me screen shots of what they got
so heres my friend scotts screen shot
and heres my friend daniels screen shot
when you put them side by side you dont even have to read the links to see how different these two pages are
but when you do read the links its really quite remarkable
daniel didnt get anything about the protests in egypt at all in his first page of google results
scotts results were full of them
and this was the big story of the day at that time
thats how different these results are becoming
so its not just google and facebook either
this is something thats sweeping the web
there are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personalization
yahoo news the biggest news site on the internet is now personalized different people get different things
huffington post the washington post the new york times all flirting with personalization in various ways
and this moves us very quickly toward a world in which the internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see but not necessarily what we need to see
as eric schmidt said it will be very hard for people to watch or consume something that has not in some sense been tailored for them
so i do think this is a problem
and i think if you take all of these filters together you take all these algorithms you get what i call a filter bubble
and your filter bubble is your own personal unique universe of information that you live in online
and whats in your filter bubble depends on who you are and it depends on what you do
but the thing is that you dont decide what gets in
and more importantly you dont actually see what gets edited out
so one of the problems with the filter bubble was discovered by some researchers at netflix
and they were looking at the netflix queues and they noticed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have noticed which is there are some movies that just sort of zip right up and out to our houses
they enter the queue they just zip right out
so iron man zips right out and waiting for superman can wait for a really long time
what they discovered was that in our netflix queues theres this epic struggle going on between our future aspirational selves and our more impulsive present selves
you know we all want to be someone who has watched rashomon but right now we want to watch ace ventura for the fourth time
so the best editing gives us a bit of both
it gives us a little bit of justin bieber and a little bit of afghanistan
it gives us some information vegetables it gives us some information dessert
and the challenge with these kinds of algorithmic filters these personalized filters is that because theyre mainly looking at what you click on first it can throw off that balance
and instead of a balanced information diet you can end up surrounded by information junk food
what this suggests is actually that we may have the story about the internet wrong
in a broadcast society this is how the founding mythology goes in a broadcast society there were these gatekeepers the editors and they controlled the flows of information
and along came the internet and it swept them out of the way and it allowed all of us to connect together and it was awesome
but thats not actually whats happening right now
what were seeing is more of a passing of the torch from human gatekeepers to algorithmic ones
and the thing is that the algorithms dont yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did
so if algorithms are going to curate the world for us if theyre going to decide what we get to see and what we dont get to see then we need to make sure that theyre not just keyed to relevance
we need to make sure that they also show us things that are uncomfortable or challenging or important this is what ted does other points of view
and the thing is weve actually been here before as a society
in its not like newspapers were sweating a lot about their civic responsibilities
then people noticed that they were doing something really important
that in fact you couldnt have a functioning democracy if citizens didnt get a good flow of information that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter and then journalistic ethics developed
it wasnt perfect but it got us through the last century
and so now were kind of back in on the web
and we need the new gatekeepers to encode that kind of responsibility into the code that theyre writing
i know that there are a lot of people here from facebook and from google larry and sergey people who have helped build the web as it is and im grateful for that
but we really need you to make sure that these algorithms have encoded in them a sense of the public life a sense of civic responsibility
we need you to make sure that theyre transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters
and we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesnt
because i think we really need the internet to be that thing that we all dreamed of it being
we need it to connect us all together
we need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives
and its not going to do that if it leaves us all isolated in a web of one
thank you

title robert thurman expanding your circle of compassion title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript it s hard to always show compassion even to the people we love but robert thurman asks that we develop compassion for our enemies he prescribes a seven step meditation exercise to extend compassion beyond our inner circle description
i want to open by quoting einsteins wonderful statement just so people will feel at ease that the great scientist of the century also agrees with us and also calls us to this action
he said a human being is a part of the whole called by us the universe a part limited in time and space
he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness
this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us
our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty
this insight of einsteins is uncannily close to that of buddhist psychology wherein compassion karuna it is called is defined as the sensitivity to anothers suffering and the corresponding will to free the other from that suffering
it pairs closely with love which is the will for the other to be happy which requires of course that one feels some happiness oneself and wishes to share it
this is perfect in that it clearly opposes self centeredness and selfishness to compassion the concern for others and further it indicates that those caught in the cycle of self concern suffer helplessly while the compassionate are more free and implicitly more happy
the dalai lama often states that compassion is his best friend
it helps him when he is overwhelmed with grief and despair
compassion helps him turn away from the feeling of his suffering as the most absolute most terrible suffering anyone has ever had and broadens his awareness of the sufferings of others even of the perpetrators of his misery and the whole mass of beings
in fact suffering is so huge and enormous his own becomes less and less monumental
and he begins to move beyond his self concern into the broader concern for others
and this immediately cheers him up as his courage is stimulated to rise to the occasion
thus he uses his own suffering as a doorway to widening his circle of compassion
he is a very good colleague of einsteins we must say
now i want to tell a story which is a very famous story in the indian and buddhist tradition of the great saint asanga who was a contemporary of augustine in the west and was sort of like the buddhist augustine
and asanga lived years after the buddhas time
and he was discontented with the state of peoples practice of the buddhist religion in india at that time
and so he said im sick of all this nobodys really living the doctrine
theyre talking about love and compassion and wisdom and enlightenment but they are acting selfish and pathetic
so buddhas teaching has lost its momentum
i know the next buddha will come a few thousand years from now but exists currently in a certain heaven thats maitreya so im going to go on a retreat and im going to meditate and pray until the buddha maitreya reveals himself to me and gives me a teaching or something to revive the practice of compassion in the world today
so he went on this retreat and he meditated for three years and he did not see the future buddha maitreya
and he left in disgust
and as he was leaving he saw a man a funny little man sitting sort of part way down the mountain
and he had a lump of iron
and he was rubbing it with a cloth
and he became interested in that
he said well what are you doing
and the man said im making a needle
and he said thats ridiculous you cant make a needle by rubbing a lump of iron with a cloth
and the man said really and he showed him a dish full of needles
so he said okay i get the point
he went back to his cave he meditated again
another three years no vision he leaves again
this time he comes down
and as hes leaving he sees a bird making a nest on a cliff ledge
and where its landing to bring the twigs to the cliff its feathers brushes the rock and it had cut the rock six to eight inches in there was a cleft in the rock by the brushing of the feathers of generations of the birds
so he said all right i get the point he went back
another three years
again no vision of maitreya after nine years
and he again leaves and this time water dripping making a giant bowl in the rock where it drips in a stream
and so again he goes back and after years there is still no vision
and hes freaked out and he wont even look left or right to see any encouraging vision
and he comes to the town hes a broken person
and there in the town hes approached by a dog who comes like this one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries even in america i think in some areas and hes looking just terrible
and he becomes interested in this dog because its so pathetic and its trying to attract his attention and he sits down looking at the dog
and the dogs whole hindquarters are a complete open sore
some of it is like gangrenous and there are maggots in the flesh and its terrible
he thinks what can i do to fix up this dog
well at least i can clean this wound and wash it
so he takes it to some water hes about to clean but then his awareness focuses on the maggots
and he sees the maggots and the maggots are kind of looking a little cute
and theyre maggoting happily in the dogs hindquarters there
well if i clean the dog ill kill the maggots so how can that be
thats it im a useless person and theres no buddha no maitreya and everything is all hopeless
and now im going to kill the maggots
so he had a brilliant idea
and he took a shard of something and cut a piece of flesh from his thigh and he placed it on ground
he was not really thinking too carefully about the aspca
he was just immediately caught with the situation
so he thought i will take the maggots and put them on this piece of flesh then clean the dogs wounds and then ill figure out what to do with the maggots
so he starts to do that he cant grab the maggots
apparently they wriggle around theyre kind of hard to grab these maggots
so he says well ill put my tongue on the dogs flesh
and then the maggots will jump on my warmer tongue the dog is kind of used up and then ill spit them one by one down on the thing
so he goes down and hes sticking his tongue out like this
and he had to close his eyes its so disgusting and the smell and everything
and then suddenly theres a pfft a noise like that
he jumps back and there of course is the future buddha maitreya in a beautiful vision rainbow lights golden jeweled a plasma body an exquisite mystic vision that he sees
and he says oh he bows
but being human hes immediately thinking of his next complaint
so as he comes up from his first bow he says my lord im so happy to see you but where have you been for years
what is this
and maitreya says i was with you who do you think was making needles and making nests and dripping on rocks for you mister dense
looking for the buddha in person he said
and he said you didnt have until this moment real compassion
and until you have real compassion you cannot recognize love
maitreya means love the loving one in sanskrit
and so he looked very dubious asanga did
and he said if you dont believe me just take me with you
and so he took the maitreya it shrunk into a globe a ball took him on his shoulder
and he ran into town in the marketplace and he said rejoice rejoice
the future buddha has come ahead of all predictions here he is
and then pretty soon they started throwing rocks and stones at him it wasnt chautauqua it was some other town because they saw a demented looking scrawny looking yogi man like some kind of hippie with a bleeding leg and a rotten dog on his shoulder shouting that the future buddha had come
so naturally they chased him out of town
but on the edge of town one elderly lady a charwoman in the charnel ground saw a jeweled foot on a jeweled lotus on his shoulder and then the dog but she saw the jewel foot of the maitreya and she offered a flower
so that encouraged him and he went with maitreya
maitreya then took him to a certain heaven which is the typical way a buddhist myth unfolds
and maitreya then kept him in heaven for five years dictating to him five complicated tomes of the methodology of how you cultivate compassion
and then i thought i would share with you what that method is or one of them
a famous one its called the sevenfold causal method of developing compassion
and it begins first by one meditating and visualizing that all beings are with one even animals too but everyone is in human form
the animals are in one of their human lives the humans are human
and then among them you think of your friends and loved ones the circle at the table
and you think of your enemies and you think of the neutral ones
and then you try to say well the loved ones i love
but you know after all theyre nice to me
i had fights with them sometimes they were unfriendly
i got mad brothers can fight parents and children can fight
so in a way i like them so much because theyre nice to me
while the neutral ones i dont know they could all be just fine
and then the enemies i dont like because theyre mean to me
but they are nice to somebody i could be them
and then the buddhists of course think that because weve all had infinite previous lives weve all been each others relatives actually
therefore all of you in the buddhist view in some previous life although you dont remember it and neither do i have been my mother for which i do apologize for the trouble i caused you
and also actually ive been your mother
ive been female and ive been every single one of yours mother in a previous life the way the buddhists reflect
so my mother in this life is really great but all of you in a way are part of the eternal mother
you gave me that expression the eternal mama you said thats wonderful
so thats the way the buddhists do it
a theist christian can think that all beings even my enemies are gods children
so in that sense were related
so they first create this foundation of equality
so we sort of reduce a little of the clinging to the ones we love just in the meditation and we open our mind to those we dont know
and we definitely reduce the hostility and the i dont want to be compassionate to them to the ones we think of as the bad guys the ones we hate and we dont like
and we dont hate anyone therefore so we equalize thats very important
and then the next thing we do is what is called mother recognition
and that is we think of every being as familiar as family
we expand we take the feeling about remembering a mama and we defuse that to all beings in this meditation
and we see the mother in every being
we see that look that the mother has on her face looking at this child that is a miracle that she has produced from her own body being a mammal where she has true compassion truly is the other and identifies completely
often the life of that other will be more important to her than her own life
and thats why its the most powerful form of altruism
the mother is the model of all altruism for human beings in spiritual traditions
and so we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression in all beings
people laugh at me because you know i used to say that i used to meditate on mama cheney as my mom when of course i was annoyed with him about all of his evil doings in iraq
i used to meditate on george bush hes quite a cute mom in a female form
he has his little ears and he smiles and he rocks you in his arms
and you think of him as nursing you
and then saddam husseins serious mustache is a problem but you think of him as a mom
and this is the way you do it you take any being who looks weird to you and you see how they could be familiar to you
and you do that for a while until you really feel that
you can feel the familiarity of all beings
nobody seems alien theyre not other
you reduce the feeling of otherness about beings
then you move from there to remembering the kindness of mothers in general if you can remember the kindness of your own mother if you can remember the kindness of your spouse or if you are a mother yourself how you were with your children
and you begin to get very sentimental you cultivate sentimentality intensely
you will even weep perhaps with gratitude and kindness
and then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that motherly possibility
every being even the most mean looking ones can be motherly
and then third you step from there to what is called a feeling of gratitude
you want to repay that kindness that all beings have shown to you
and then the fourth step you go to what is called lovely love
in each one of these you can take some weeks or months or days depending on how you do it or you can do them in a run this meditation
and then you think of how lovely beings are when they are happy when they are satisfied
and every being looks beautiful when they are internally feeling a happiness
their face doesnt look like this when theyre angry they look ugly every being but when theyre happy they look beautiful
and so you see beings in their potential happiness
and you feel a love toward them and you want them to be happy even the enemy
we think jesus is being unrealistic when he says love thine enemy
he does say that and we think hes being unrealistic and sort of spiritual and highfalutin nice for him to say it but i cant do that
but actually thats practical
if you love your enemy that means you want your enemy to be happy
if your enemy was really happy why would they bother to be your enemy
how boring to run around chasing you
they would be relaxing somewhere having a good time
so it makes sense to want your enemy to be happy because theyll stop being your enemy because thats too much trouble
but anyway thats the lovely love and then finally the fifth step is compassion universal compassion
and that is where you then look at the reality of all the beings you can think of
and you look at them and you see how they are
and you realize how unhappy they are actually mostly most of the time
you see that furrowed brow in people
and then you realize they dont even have compassion on themselves
theyre driven by this duty and this obligation
i have to get that i need more im not worthy and i should do something
and theyre rushing around all stressed out
and they think of it as somehow macho hard discipline on themselves
but actually they are cruel to themselves
and of course they are cruel and ruthless toward others
and they then never get any positive feedback
and the more they succeed and the more power they have the more unhappy they are
and this is where you feel real compassion for them
and you then feel you must act
and the choice of the action of course hopefully will be more practical than poor asanga who was fixing the maggots on the dog because he had that motivation and whoever was in front of him he wanted to help
but of course that is impractical he should have founded the aspca in the town and gotten some scientific help for dogs and maggots
and im sure he did that later but that just indicates the state of mind you know
and so the next step the sixth step beyond universal compassion is this thing where youre linked with the needs of others in a true way and you have compassion for yourself also and it isnt sentimental only you might be in fear of something
some bad guy is making himself more and more unhappy being more and more mean to other people and getting punished in the future for it in various ways
and in buddhism they catch it in the future life
of course in theistic religion theyre punished by god or whatever
and materialism they think they get out of it just by not existing by dying but they dont
and so they get reborn as whatever you know
never mind i wont get into that
but the next step is called universal responsibility
and that is very important the charter of compassion must lead us to develop through true compassion what is called universal responsibility
in the great teaching of his holiness the dalai lama that he always teaches everywhere he says that that is the common religion of humanity kindness
but kindness means universal responsibility
and that means whatever happens to other beings is happening to us we are responsible for that and we should take it and do whatever we can at whatever little level and small level that we can do it
we absolutely must do that there is no way not to do it
and then finally that leads to a new orientation in life where we live equally for ourselves and for others and we are joyful and happy
one thing we mustnt think is that compassion makes you miserable
compassion makes you happy
the first person who is happy when you get great compassion is yourself even if you havent done anything yet for anybody else
although the change in your mind already does something for other beings they can sense this new quality in yourself and it helps them already and gives them an example
and that uncompassionate clock has just showed me that its all over
so practice compassion read the charter disseminate it and develop it within yourself
dont just think well im compassionate or im not compassionate and sort of think youre stuck there
you can develop this you can diminish the non compassion the cruelty the callousness the neglect of others and take universal responsibility for them
and then not only will god smile and the eternal mama will smile but karen armstrong will smile
thank you very much

title alan russell the potential of regenerative medicine title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript alan russell studies regenerative medicine a breakthrough way of thinking about disease and injury using a process that can signal the body to rebuild itself description
im going to talk to you today about hopefully converting fear into hope
when we go to the physician today when we go to the doctors office and we walk in there are words that we just dont want to hear
there are words that were truly afraid of
diabetes cancer parkinsons alzheimers heart failure lung failure things that we know are debilitating diseases for which theres relatively little that can be done
and what i want to lay out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease why its important why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down if you think it already hasnt and where we are clinically today and where we might go tomorrow and what some of the hurdles are
and were going to do all of that in minutes i promise
i want to start with this slide because this slide sort of tells the story the way science magazine thinks of it
this was an issue from that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human
it was basically a regenerative medicine issue
regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept that everybody can understand
its simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself to a clinically relevant timescale
so we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there
we know that if we have a damaged hip you can put an artificial hip in
and this is the idea that science magazine used on their front cover
this is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine
this is not regenerative medicine
regenerative medicine is what business week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago
the idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms with devices and drugs and the like and ill come back to that theme a few times instead of doing that we will regenerate lost function of the body by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue
so that at the end of the treatment you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment
very few good ideas if you agree that this is a good idea very few good ideas are truly novel
and this is just the same
if you look back in history charles lindbergh who was better known for flying airplanes was actually one of the first people along with alexis carrel one of the nobel laureates from rockefeller to begin to think about could you culture organs
and they published this book in where they actually began to think about what could you do in bio reactors to grow whole organs
weve come a long way since then
im going to share with you some of the exciting work thats going on
but before doing that what id like to do is share my depression about the health care system and the need for this with you
many of the talks yesterday talked about improving the quality of life and reducing poverty and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe
one of the challenges is that the richer we are the longer we live
and the longer we live the more expensive it is to take care of our diseases as we get older
this is simply the wealth of a country versus the percent of population over the age of
and you can basically see that the richer a country is the older the people are within it
why is this important
and why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now
if the average age of your population is then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a broken ankle every now and again maybe a little bit of asthma
if the average age in your country is to now the average person is looking at diabetes early onset diabetes heart failure coronary artery disease things that are inherently more difficult to treat and much more expensive to treat
just have a look at the demographics in the u s here
this is from the untied states of america
in there were workers per retiree
people who were basically outside of being really sick paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease
in two workers per retiree in the u s
and this is matched in every industrialized wealthy country in the world
how can you actually afford to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this
this is age versus cost of health care
and you can see that right around age to theres a sudden spike in the cost of health care
its actually quite interesting if you do the right studies you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care plotted over your lifetime
and about seven years before youre about to die theres a spike
and you can actually we wont get into that
there are very few things very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases and experience what i would call healthy aging
id suggest there are four things and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system
all those things do is change who pays
they dont actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is
one thing you can do is not treat you can ration health care
we wont talk about that anymore its too depressing
you can prevent
obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention
but perhaps most interesting to me anyway and most important is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression and then treating the disease to cure the disease instead of treating a symptom
think of it in terms of diabetes for instance
today with diabetes what do we do
we diagnose the disease eventually once it becomes symptomatic and then we treat the symptom for years
and we do ok insulins a pretty good therapy
but eventually it stops working and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease
why couldnt we just inject the pancreas with something to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease perhaps even before it was symptomatic
and it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it but if it worked we would truly be able to do something different
this video i think gets across the concept that im talking about quite dramatically
this is a newt re growing its limb
if a newt can do this kind of thing why cant we
ill actually show you some more important features about limb regeneration in a moment
but what were talking about in regenerative medicine is doing this in every organ system of the body for tissues and for organs themselves
so todays reality is that if we get sick the message is we will treat your symptoms and you need to adjust to a new way of life
i would pose to you that tomorrow and when tomorrow is we could debate but its within the foreseeable future we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation
theres a limb prosthetic up here similar actually one on the soldier thats come back from iraq
there are soldiers that have come back from iraq that have lost limbs
imagine if instead of facing that they could actually face the regeneration of that limb
its a wild concept
ill show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept
but its applicable again to every organ system
how can we do that
the way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body
we need to learn to speak the bodys language
and to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus
a mammalian fetus if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy will re grow that limb
so our dna has the capacity to do these kinds of wound healing mechanisms
its a natural process but it is lost as we age
in a child before the age of about six months if they lose their fingertip in an accident theyll re grow their fingertip
by the time theyre five they wont be able to do that anymore
so to engage in that conversation with the body we need to speak the bodys language
and there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today
im going to give you an example of three of these tools through which to converse with the body
the first is cellular therapies
clearly we heal ourselves in a natural process using cells to do most of the work
therefore if we can find the right cells and implant them in the body they may do the healing
secondly we can use materials
we heard yesterday about the importance of new materials
if we can invent materials design materials or extract materials from a natural environment then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself
and finally we may be able to use smart devices that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal
im going to show you an example of each of these and im going to start with materials
steve badylak whos at the university of pittsburgh about a decade ago had a remarkable idea
and that idea was that the small intestine of a pig if you threw away all the cells and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself
and he asked a very important question
he asked the question if i take that material which is a natural material that usually induces healing in the small intestine and i place it somewhere else on a persons body would it give a tissue specific response or would it make small intestine if i tried to make a new ear
i wouldnt be telling you this story if it werent compelling
the picture im about to show you however for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends the lights are down this is a good time to look at your feet check your blackberry do anything other than look at the screen
what im about to show you is a diabetic ulcer
and although its good to laugh before we look at this
this is the reality of diabetes
i think a lot of times we hear about diabetics diabetic ulcers we just dont connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment which is amputation if you cant heal it
so im going to put the slide up now it wont be up for long
this is a diabetic ulcer its tragic
the treatment for this is amputation
this is an older lady she has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes and has decided to die with what s left of her body intact
and this lady decided after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer that she would try this new therapy that steve invented
thats what the wound looked like weeks later
that material contained only natural signals
and that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response that it didnt have before
theres going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you ill let you know when you can look again
this is a horse the horse is not in pain
if the horse was in pain i wouldnt show you this slide
the horse just has another nostril thats developed because of a riding accident
just a few weeks after treatment in this case taking that material turning it into a gel and packing that area and then repeating the treatment a few times and the horse heals up
and if you took an ultrasound of that area it would look great
heres a dolphin where the fins been re attached
there are now patients around the world who have used that material to heal their wounds
could you regenerate a limb
darpa just gave steve million dollars to lead an eight institution project to begin the process of asking that question
and ill show you the million dollar picture
this is a year old man whos lost the end of his fingertip
remember that i mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips
after treatment thats what it looks like
this is happening today
this is clinically relevant today
there are materials that do this here are the heart patches
but could you go a little further
could you say instead of using material can i take some cells along with the material and remove a damaged piece of tissue put a bio degradable material on there
you can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish
this was done by teruo okano at tokyo womens hospital
he can actually grow beating tissue in a dish
he chills the dish it changes its properties and he peels it right out of the dish
its the coolest stuff
now im going to show you cell based regeneration
and what im going to show you here is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient
again if youre squeamish you dont want to watch
but this ones kind of cool
so this is a bypass operation just like what al gore had with a difference
in this case at the end of the bypass operation youre going to see the stem cells from the patient that were removed at the beginning of the procedure being injected directly into the heart of the patient
and im standing up here because at one point im going to show you just how early this technology is
here go the stem cells right into the beating heart of the patient
and if you look really carefully its going to be right around this point youll actually see a back flush
you see the cells coming back out
we need all sorts of new technology new devices to get the cells to the right place at the right time
just a little bit of data a tiny bit of data
this was a randomized trial
at this time this was an n of now theres an n of about
basically if you take an extremely sick patient and you give them a bypass they get a little bit better
if you give them stem cells as well as their bypass for these particular patients they became asymptomatic
these are now two years out
the coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state
this is the same procedure but now done minimally invasively with only three holes in the body where theyre taking the heart and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure
there go the cells
we dont have time to go into all of those details but basically that works too
you can take patients who are less sick and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state through that kind of therapy
heres another example of stem cell therapy that isnt quite clinical yet but i think very soon will be
this is the work of kacey marra from pittsburgh along with a number of colleagues around the world
theyve decided that liposuction fluid which in the united states we have a lot of liposuction fluid
its a great source of stem cells
stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid
so you could go in you could get your tummy tuck
out comes the liposuction fluid and in this case the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons
all done in the lab
and i think fairly soon you will see patients being treated with their own fat derived or adipose derived stem cells
i talked before about the use of devices to dramatically change the way we treat disease
heres just one example before i close up
this is equally tragic
we have a very abiding and heartbreaking partnership with our colleagues at the institute for surgical research in the us army who have to treat the now kids that have come back from iraq
many of those patients are very severely burned
and if theres anything thats been learned about burn its that we dont know how to treat it
everything that is done to treat burn basically we do a sodding approach
we make something over here and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound and we try and get the two to take
in this case here a new wearable bio reactor has been designed it should be tested clinically later this year at isr by joerg gerlach in pittsburgh
and that bio reactor will lay down in the wound bed
the gun that you see there sprays cells
thats going to spray cells over that area
the reactor will serve to fertilize the environment deliver other things as well at the same time and therefore we will seed that lawn as opposed to try the sodding approach
its a completely different way of doing it
so my minutes is up
so let me finish up with some good news and maybe a little bit of bad news
the good news is that this is happening today
its very powerful work
clearly the images kind of get that across
its incredibly difficult because its highly inter disciplinary
almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice is involved in trying to get this to happen
a number of governments and a number of regions have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease
the japanese government were perhaps the first when they decided to invest first billion later another billion in this field
its no coincidence
japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age
they need this to work or their health system dies
so theyre putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area
the european union same thing
china the same thing
china just launched a national tissue engineering center
the first year budget was million us dollars
in the united states weve had a somewhat different approach
oh for al gore to come and be in the real world as president
weve had a different approach
and the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along
but theres been no strategic investment to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way
and im going to finish up with a quote maybe a little cheap shot at the director of the nih whos a very charming man
myself and jay vacanti from harvard went to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute just a few months ago to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece of that billion dollars that hes going to get next year and focus it in a strategic way to make sure we can accelerate the pace at which these things get to patients
and at the end of a very testy meeting what the nih director said was your vision is larger than our appetite
id like to close by saying that no ones going to change our vision but together we can change his appetite
thank you

title terry moore why is x the unknown title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript why is x the symbol for an unknown in this short and funny talk terry moore gives the surprising answer description
i have the answer to a question that weve all asked
the question is why is it that the letter x represents the unknown
now i know we learned that in math class but now its everywhere in the culture the x prize the x files project x tedx
whered that come from
about six years ago i decided that i would learn arabic which turns out to be a supremely logical language
to write a word or a phrase or a sentence in arabic is like crafting an equation because every part is extremely precise and carries a lot of information
thats one of the reasons so much of what weve come to think of as western science and mathematics and engineering was really worked out in the first few centuries of the common era by the persians and the arabs and the turks
this includes the little system in arabic called al jebra
and al jebr roughly translates to the system for reconciling disparate parts
al jebr finally came into english as algebra
one example among many
the arabic texts containing this mathematical wisdom finally made their way to europe which is to say spain in the and centuries
and when they arrived there was tremendous interest in translating this wisdom into a european language
but there were problems
one problem is there are some sounds in arabic that just dont make it through a european voice box without lots of practice
trust me on that one
also those very sounds tend not to be represented by the characters that are available in european languages
heres one of the culprits
this is the letter sheen and it makes the sound we think of as sh sh
its also the very first letter of the word shalan which means something just like the the english word something some undefined unknown thing
now in arabic we can make this definite by adding the definite article al
so this is al shalan the unknown thing
and this is a word that appears throughout early mathematics such as this century derivation of proofs
the problem for the medieval spanish scholars who were tasked with translating this material is that the letter sheen and the word shalan cant be rendered into spanish because spanish doesnt have that sh that sh sound
so by convention they created a rule in which they borrowed the ck sound ck sound from the classical greek in the form of the letter kai
later when this material was translated into a common european language which is to say latin they simply replaced the greek kai with the latin x
and once that happened once this material was in latin it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks for almost years
but now we have the answer to our question
why is it that x is the unknown
x is the unknown because you cant say sh in spanish
and i thought that was worth sharing

title mike biddle we can recycle plastic title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript less than of plastic trash is recycled compared to almost of metals because of the massively complicated problem of finding and sorting the different kinds frustrated by this waste mike biddle has developed a cheap and incredibly energy efficient plant that can and does recycle any kind of plastic description
im a garbage man
and you might find it interesting that i became a garbage man because i absolutely hate waste
i hope within the next minutes to change the way you think about a lot of the stuff in your life
and id like to start at the very beginning
think back when you were just a kid
how did look at the stuff in your life
perhaps it was like these toddler rules its my stuff if i saw it first
the entire pile is my stuff if im building something
the more stuff thats mine the better
and of course its your stuff if its broken
well after spending about years in the recycling industry its become pretty clear to me that we dont necessarily leave these toddler rules behind as we develop into adults
and let me tell you why i have that perspective
because each and every day at our recycling plants around the world we handle about one million pounds of peoples discarded stuff
now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff but its a tiny drop of the durable goods that are disposed each and every year around the world well less than one percent
in fact the united nations estimates that theres about billion pounds a year of electronics waste that gets discarded around the world each and every year and thats one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream
and if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth that number well more than doubles
and of course the more developed the country the bigger these mountains
now when you see these mountains most people think of garbage
we see above ground mines
and the reason we see mines is because theres a lot of valuable raw materials that went into making all of this stuff in the first place
and its becoming increasingly important that we figure out how to extract these raw materials from these extremely complicated waste streams
because as weve heard all week at ted the worlds getting to be a smaller place with more people in it who want more and more stuff
and of course they want the toys and the tools that many of us take for granted
and what goes into making those toys and tools that we use every single day
its mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals
and the metals we typically get from ore that we mine in ever widening mines and ever deepening mines around the world
and the plastics we get from oil which we go to more remote locations and drill ever deeper wells to extract
and these practices have significant economic and environmental implications that were already starting to see today
the good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end of life stuff and starting to recycle our end of life stuff particularly in regions of the world like here in europe that have recycling policies in place that require that this stuff be recycled in a responsible manner
most of whats extracted from our end of life stuff if it makes it to a recycler are the metals
to put that in perspective and im using steel as a proxy here for metals because its the most common metal if your stuff makes it to a recycler probably over percent of the metals are going to be recovered and reused for another purpose
plastics are a whole other story well less than percent are recovered
in fact its more like five percent
most of its incinerated or landfilled
now most people think thats because plastics are a throw away material have very little value
but actually plastics are several times more valuable than steel
and theres more plastics produced and consumed around the world on a volume basis every year than steel
so why is such a plentiful and valuable material not recovered at anywhere near the rate of the less valuable material
well its predominantly because metals are very easy to recycle from other materials and from one another
they have very different densities
they have different electrical and magnetic properties
and they even have different colors
so its very easy for either humans or machines to separate these metals from one another and from other materials
plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range
they have either identical or very similar electrical and magnetic properties
and any plastic can be any color as you probably well know
so the traditional ways of separating materials just simply dont work for plastics
another consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans is that a lot of our stuff from the developed world and sadly to say particularly from the united states where we dont have any recycling policies in place like here in europe finds its way to developing countries for low cost recycling
people for as little as a dollar a day pick through our stuff
they extract what they can which is mostly the metals circuit boards and so forth and they leave behind mostly what they cant recover which is again mostly the plastics
or they burn the plastics to get to the metals in burn houses like you see here
and they extract the metals by hand
now while this may be the low economic cost solution this is certainly not the low environmental or human health and safety solution
i call this environmental arbitrage
and its not fair its not safe and its not sustainable
now because the plastics are so plentiful and by the way those other methods dont lead to the recovery of plastics obviously but people do try to recover the plastics
this is just one example
this is a photo i took standing on the rooftops of one of the largest slums in the world in mumbai india
they store the plastics on the roofs
they bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these and people try very hard to separate the plastics by color by shape by feel by any technique they can
and sometimes theyll resort to whats known as the burn and sniff technique where theyll burn the plastic and smell the fumes to try to determine the type of plastic
none of these techniques result in any amount of recycling in any significant way
and by the way please dont try this technique at home
so what are we to do about this space age material at least what we used to call a space aged material these plastics
well i certainly believe that its far too valuable and far too abundant to keep putting back in the ground or certainly send up in smoke
so about years ago i literally started in my garage tinkering around trying to figure out how to separate these very similar materials from each other and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends in the mining world actually and in the plastics world and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world
because after all were doing above ground mining
and we eventually broke the code
this is the last frontier of recycling
its the last major material to be recovered in any significant amount on the earth
and we finally figured out how to do it
and in the process we started recreating how the plastics industry makes plastics
the traditional way to make plastics is with oil or petrochemicals
you breakdown the molecules you recombine them in very specific ways to make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day
we said theres got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics
and not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint sustainable from an economic standpoint as well
well a good place to start is with waste
it certainly doesnt cost as much as oil and its plentiful as i hope that youve been able to see from the photographs
and because were not breaking down the plastic into molecules and recombining them were using a mining approach to extract the materials
we have significantly lower capital costs in our plant equipment
we have enormous energy savings
i dont know how many other projects on the planet right now can save to percent of the energy compared to making something the traditional way
and instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars to build a chemical plant that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them
and we make a drop in replacement for that plastic thats made from petrochemicals
our customers get to enjoy huge savings
they get to close the loop with their products
and they get to make more sustainable products
in the short time period i have i want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this
it starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits
they recover the metals and leave behind whats called shredder residue its their waste a very complex mixture of materials but predominantly plastics
we take out the things that arent plastics such as the metals they missed carpeting foam rubber wood glass paper you name it
even an occasional dead animal unfortunately
and it goes in the first part of our process here which is more like traditional recycling
were sieving the material were using magnets were using air classification
it looks like the willy wonka factory at this point
at the end of this process we have a mixed plastic composite many different types of plastics and many different grades of plastics
this goes into the more sophisticated part of our process and the really hard work multi step separation process begins
we grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail
we use a very highly automated process to sort those plastics not only by type but by grade
and out the end of that part of the process come little flakes of plastic one type one grade
we then use optical sorting to color sort this material
we blend it in lb blending silos
we push that material to extruders where we melt it push it through small die holes make spaghetti like plastic strands
and we chop those strands into what are called pellets
and this becomes the currency of the plastics industry
this is the same material that you would get from oil
and today were producing it from your old stuff and its going right back into your new stuff
so now instead of your stuff ending up on a hillside in a developing country or literally going up in smoke you can find your old stuff back on top of your desk in new products in your office or back at work in your home
and these are just a few examples of companies that are buying our plastic replacing virgin plastic to make their new products
so i hope ive changed the way you look at at least some of the stuff in your life
we took our clues from mother nature
mother nature wastes very little reuses practically everything
and i hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer thats a label ive always hated my entire life and think of yourself as just using resources in one form until they can be transformed to another form for another use later in time
and finally i hope you agree with me to change that last toddler rule just a little bit to if its broken its my stuff
thank you for your time

in cyclone nargis devastated myanmar
millions of people were in severe need of help
the u n wanted to rush people and supplies to the area
but there were no maps no maps of roads no maps showing hospitals no way for help to reach the cyclone victims
when we look at a map of los angeles or london it is hard to believe that as of only percent of the world was mapped to a geo codable level of detail
the u n ran headfirst into a problem that the majority of the worlds populous faces not having detailed maps
but help was coming
at google volunteers used a new software to map kilometers of roads hospitals logistics and relief points
and it took them four days
the new software they used google mapmaker
google mapmaker is a technology that empowers each of us to map what we know locally
people have used this software to map everything from roads to rivers from schools to local businesses and video stores to the corner store
maps matter
nobel prize nominee hernando de soto recognized that the key to economic liftoff for most developing countries is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land
for example a trillion dollars of real estate remains uncapitalized in india alone
in the last year alone thousands of users in countries have mapped millions of pieces of information and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable
and this was made possible by the power of passionate users everywhere
lets look at some of the maps being created by users right now
so as we speak people are mapping the world in these countries
you can see bridget in africa who just mapped a road in senegal
and closer to home chalua an n g road in bangalore
this is the result of computational geometry gesture recognition and machine learning
this is a victory of thousands of users in hundreds of cities one user one edit at a time
this is an invitation to the percent of our unmapped planet

title nathan myhrvold cooking as never seen before title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript cookbook author nathan myhrvold talks about his magisterial work modernist cuisine and shares the secret of its cool photographic illustrations which show cross sections of food in the very act of being cooked description
so im going to tell you a little bit about reimagining food
ive been interested in food for a long time
i taught myself to cook with a bunch of big books like this
i went to chef school in france
and there is a way the world both envisions food the way the world writes about food and learns about food
and its largely what you would find in these books
and its a wonderful thing
but theres some things that have been going on since this idea of food was established
in the last years people have realized that science has a tremendous amount to do with food
in fact understanding why cooking works requires knowing the science of cooking some of the chemistry some of the physics and so forth
but thats not in any of those books
theres also a tremendous number of techniques that chefs have developed some about new aesthetics new approaches to food
theres a chef in spain named ferran adria
hes developed a very avant garde cuisine
a guy in england called heston blumenthal hes developed his avant garde cuisine
none of the techniques that these people have developed over the course of the last years is in any of those books
none of them are taught in cooking schools
in order to learn them you have to go work in those restaurants
and finally theres the old way of viewing food is the old way
and so a few years ago fours years ago actually i set out to say is there a way we can communicate science and technique and wonder
is there a way we can show people food in a way they have not seen it before
so we tried and ill show you what we came up with
this is a picture called a cutaway
this is actually the first picture i took in the book
the idea here is to explain what happens when you steam broccoli
and this magic view allows you to see all of whats happening while the broccoli steams
then each of the different little pieces around it explain some fact
and the hope was two fold
one is you can actually explain what happens when you steam broccoli
but the other thing is that maybe we could seduce people into stuff that was a little more technical maybe a little bit more scientific maybe a little bit more chef y than they otherwise would have
because with that beautiful photo maybe i can also package this little box here that talks about how steaming and boiling actually take different amounts of time
steaming ought to be faster
it turns out it isnt because of something called film condensation and this explains that
well that first cutaway picture worked so we said okay lets do some more
so heres another one
we discovered why woks are the shape they are
this shaped wok doesnt work very well this caught fire three times
but we had a philosophy which is it only has to look good for a thousandth of a second
and one of our canning cutaways
once you start cutting things in half you kind of get carried away so you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan
and each of these text blocks explains a key thing thats going on
in this case boiling water canning is for canning things that are already pretty acidic
you dont have to heat them up as hot as you would something you do pressure canning because bacterial spores cant grow in the acid
so this is great for pickled vegetables which is what were canning here
heres our hamburger cutaway
one of our philosophies in the book is that no dish is really intrinsically any better than any other dish
so you can lavish all the same care all the same technique on a hamburger as you would on some much more fancy dish
and if you do lavish as much technique as possible and you try to make the highest quality hamburger it gets to be a little bit involved
the new york times ran a piece after my book was delayed and it was called the wait for the hour hamburger just got longer
because our hamburger recipe our ultimate hamburger recipe if you make the buns and you marinate the meat and you do all this stuff it does take about hours
of course youre not actually working the whole time
most of the time is kind of sitting there
the point of this cutaway is to show people a view of hamburgers they havent seen before and to explain the physics of hamburgers and the chemistry of hamburgers because believe it or not there is something to the physics and chemistry in particular those flames underneath the burger
most of the characteristic char grilled taste doesnt come from the wood or the charcoal
buying mesquite charcoal will not actually make that much difference
mostly it comes from fat pyrolyzing or burning
so its the fat that drips down and flares up that causes the characteristic taste
now you might wonder how do we make these cutaways
most people assume we use photoshop
and the answer is no not really we use a machine shop
and it turns out the best way to cut things in half is to actually cut them in half
so we have two halves of one of the best kitchens in the world
we cut a restaurant oven in half
the manufacturer said what would it take for you to cut one in half
i said it would have to show up free
and so it showed up we used it a little while we cut it in half
now you can also see a little bit how we did some of these shots
we would glue a piece of pyrex or heat resistant glass in front
we used a red very high temperature silicon to do that
the great thing is when you cut something in half you have another half
so you photograph that in exactly the same position and then you can substitute in and that part does use photoshop just the edges
so its very much like in a hollywood movie where a guy flies through the air supported by wires and then they take the wires away digitally so youre flying through the air
in most cases though there was no glass
like for the hamburger we just cut the damn barbecue
and so those coals that kept falling off the edge we kept having to put them back up
but again it only has to work for a thousandth of a second
the wok shot caught fire three times
what happens when you have your wok cut in half is the oil goes down into the fire and whoosh
one of our cooks lost his eyebrows that way
but hey they grow back
in addition to cutaways we also explain physics
this is fouriers law of heat conduction
its a partial differential equation
we have the only cookbook in the world that has partial differential equations in it
but to make them palatable we cut it out of a steel plate and put it in front of a fire and photographed it like this
weve got lots of little tidbits in the book
everybody knows that your various appliances have wattage right
but you probably dont know that much about james watt
but now you will we put a biography of james watt in
its a little couple paragraphs to explain why we call that unit of heat the watt and where he got his inspiration
it turned out he was hired by a scottish distillery to understand why they were burning so damn much peat to distill the whiskey
we also did a lot of calculation
i personally wrote thousands of lines of code to write this cookbook
heres a calculation that shows how the intensity of a barbecue or other radiant heat source goes as you move away from it
so as you move vertically away from this surface the heat falls off
as you move side to side it moves off
that horn shaped region is what we call the sweet spot
thats the place where the heat is even to within percent
so thats the place where you really want to cook
and its got this funny horn shaped thing which as far as i know again the first cookbook to ever do this
now it may also be the last cookbook that ever does it
you know theres two ways you can make a product
you can do lots of market research and do focus groups and figure out what people really want or you can just kind of go for it and make the book you want and hope other people like it
heres a step by step that shows grinding hamburger
if you really want great hamburger it turns out it makes a difference if you align the grain
and its really simple as you can see here
as it comes out of the grinder you just have a little tray and you just take it off in little passes build it up slice it vertically
heres the final hamburger
this is the hour hamburger
we make every aspect of this burger
the lettuce has got liquid smoke infused into it
we also have things about how to make the bun
theres a mushroom ketchup it goes on and on
now watch closely this is popcorn ill explain it here
the popcorn is illustrating a key thing in physics
isnt that beautiful
we have a very high speed camera which we had lots of fun with on the book
the key physics principle here is when water boils to steam it expands by a factor of
thats whats happening to the water inside that popcorn
so its a great illustration of that
now im going to close with a video that is kind of unusual
we have a chapter on gels
and because people watch mythbusters and csi i thought well lets put in a recipe for a ballistics gelatin
well if you have a high speed camera and you have a block of ballistics gelatin lying around pretty soon somebody does this
now the amazing thing here is that a ballistics gelatin is supposed to mimic what happens to human flesh when you get shot thats why you shouldnt get shot
the other amazing thing is when this ballistics gelatin comes down it falls back down as a nice block
anyway heres the book
here it is
pages
and theyre nice big pages too
a friend of mine complained that this was too big and too pretty to go in the kitchen so theres a sixth volume that has washable waterproof paper

title brian greene is our universe the only universe title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript is there more than one universe in this visually rich action packed talk brian greene shows how the unanswered questions of physics have led to the theory that our own universe is just one of many in the multiverse description
a few months ago the nobel prize in physics was awarded to two teams of astronomers for a discovery that has been hailed as one of the most important astronomical observations ever
and today after briefly describing what they found im going to tell you about a highly controversial framework for explaining their discovery namely the possibility that way beyond the earth the milky way and other distant galaxies we may find that our universe is not the only universe but is instead part of a vast complex of universes that we call the multiverse
now the idea of a multiverse is a strange one
i mean most of us were raised to believe that the word universe means everything
and i say most of us with forethought as my four year old daughter has heard me speak of these ideas since she was born
and last year i was holding her and i said sophia i love you more than anything in the universe
and she turned to me and said daddy universe or multiverse
but barring such an anomalous upbringing it is strange to imagine other realms separate from ours most with fundamentally different features that would rightly be called universes of their own
and yet speculative though the idea surely is i aim to convince you that theres reason for taking it seriously as it just might be right
im going to tell the story of the multiverse in three parts
in part one im going to describe those nobel prize winning results and to highlight a profound mystery which those results revealed
in part two ill offer a solution to that mystery
its based on an approach called string theory and thats where the idea of the multiverse will come into the story
finally in part three im going to describe a cosmological theory called inflation which will pull all the pieces of the story together
okay part one starts back in when the great astronomer edwin hubble realized that the distant galaxies were all rushing away from us establishing that space itself is stretching its expanding
now this was revolutionary
the prevailing wisdom was that on the largest of scales the universe was static
but even so there was one thing that everyone was certain of the expansion must be slowing down
that much as the gravitational pull of the earth slows the ascent of an apple tossed upward the gravitational pull of each galaxy on every other must be slowing the expansion of space
now lets fast forward to the when those two teams of astronomers i mentioned at the outset were inspired by this reasoning to measure the rate at which the expansion has been slowing
and they did this by painstaking observations of numerous distant galaxies allowing them to chart how the expansion rate has changed over time
heres the surprise they found that the expansion is not slowing down
instead they found that its speeding up going faster and faster
thats like tossing an apple upward and it goes up faster and faster
now if you saw an apple do that youd want to know why
whats pushing on it
similarly the astronomers results are surely well deserving of the nobel prize but they raised an analogous question
what force is driving all galaxies to rush away from every other at an ever quickening speed
well the most promising answer comes from an old idea of einsteins
you see we are all used to gravity being a force that does one thing pulls objects together
but in einsteins theory of gravity his general theory of relativity gravity can also push things apart
how well according to einsteins math if space is uniformly filled with an invisible energy sort of like a uniform invisible mist then the gravity generated by that mist would be repulsive repulsive gravity which is just what we need to explain the observations
because the repulsive gravity of an invisible energy in space we now call it dark energy but ive made it smokey white here so you can see it its repulsive gravity would cause each galaxy to push against every other driving expansion to speed up not slow down
and this explanation represents great progress
but i promised you a mystery here in part one
here it is
when the astronomers worked out how much of this dark energy must be infusing space to account for the cosmic speed up look at what they found
this number is small
expressed in the relevant unit it is spectacularly small
and the mystery is to explain this peculiar number
we want this number to emerge from the laws of physics but so far no one has found a way to do that
now you might wonder should you care
maybe explaining this number is just a technical issue a technical detail of interest to experts but of no relevance to anybody else
well it surely is a technical detail but some details really matter
some details provide windows into uncharted realms of reality and this peculiar number may be doing just that as the only approach thats so far made headway to explain it invokes the possibility of other universes an idea that naturally emerges from string theory which takes me to part two string theory
so hold the mystery of the dark energy in the back of your mind as i now go on to tell you three key things about string theory
first off what is it
well its an approach to realize einsteins dream of a unified theory of physics a single overarching framework that would be able to describe all the forces at work in the universe
and the central idea of string theory is quite straightforward
it says that if you examine any piece of matter ever more finely at first youll find molecules and then youll find atoms and subatomic particles
but the theory says that if you could probe smaller much smaller than we can with existing technology youd find something else inside these particles a little tiny vibrating filament of energy a little tiny vibrating string
and just like the strings on a violin they can vibrate in different patterns producing different musical notes
these little fundamental strings when they vibrate in different patterns they produce different kinds of particles so electrons quarks neutrinos photons all other particles would be united into a single framework as they would all arise from vibrating strings
its a compelling picture a kind of cosmic symphony where all the richness that we see in the world around us emerges from the music that these little tiny strings can play
but theres a cost to this elegant unification because years of research have shown that the math of string theory doesnt quite work
it has internal inconsistencies unless we allow for something wholly unfamiliar extra dimensions of space
that is we all know about the usual three dimensions of space
and you can think about those as height width and depth
but string theory says that on fantastically small scales there are additional dimensions crumpled to a tiny size so small that we have not detected them
but even though the dimensions are hidden they would have an impact on things that we can observe because the shape of the extra dimensions constrains how the strings can vibrate
and in string theory vibration determines everything
so particle masses the strengths of forces and most importantly the amount of dark energy would be determined by the shape of the extra dimensions
so if we knew the shape of the extra dimensions we should be able to calculate these features calculate the amount of dark energy
the challenge is we dont know the shape of the extra dimensions
all we have is a list of candidate shapes allowed by the math
now when these ideas were first developed there were only about five different candidate shapes so you can imagine analyzing them one by one to determine if any yield the physical features we observe
but over time the list grew as researchers found other candidate shapes
from five the number grew into the hundreds and then the thousands a large but still manageable collection to analyze since after all graduate students need something to do
but then the list continued to grow into the millions and the billions until today
the list of candidate shapes has soared to about to the
so what to do
well some researchers lost heart concluding that was so many candidate shapes for the extra dimensions each giving rise to different physical features string theory would never make definitive testable predictions
but others turned this issue on its head taking us to the possibility of a multiverse
heres the idea
maybe each of these shapes is on an equal footing with every other
each is as real as every other in the sense that there are many universes each with a different shape for the extra dimensions
and this radical proposal has a profound impact on this mystery the amount of dark energy revealed by the nobel prize winning results
because you see if there are other universes and if those universes each have say a different shape for the extra dimensions then the physical features of each universe will be different and in particular the amount of dark energy in each universe will be different
which means that the mystery of explaining the amount of dark energy weve now measured would take on a wholly different character
in this context the laws of physics cant explain one number for the dark energy because there isnt just one number there are many numbers
which means we have been asking the wrong question
its that the right question to ask is why do we humans find ourselves in a universe with a particular amount of dark energy weve measured instead of any of the other possibilities and thats a question on which we can make headway
because those universes that have much more dark energy than ours whenever matter tries to clump into galaxies the repulsive push of the dark energy is so strong that it blows the clump apart and galaxies dont form
and in those universes that have much less dark energy well they collapse back on themselves so quickly that again galaxies dont form
and without galaxies there are no stars no planets and no chance for our form of life to exist in those other universes
so we find ourselves in a universe with the particular amount of dark energy weve measured simply because our universe has conditions hospitable to our form of life
and that would be that
mystery solved multiverse found
now some find this explanation unsatisfying
were used to physics giving us definitive explanations for the features we observe
but the point is if the feature youre observing can and does take on a wide variety of different values across the wider landscape of reality then thinking one explanation for a particular value is simply misguided
an early example comes from the great astronomer johannes kepler who was obsessed with understanding a different number why the sun is million miles away from the earth
and he worked for decades trying to explain this number but he never succeeded and we know why
kepler was asking the wrong question
we now know that there are many planets at a wide variety of different distances from their host stars
so hoping that the laws of physics will explain one particular number million miles well that is simply wrongheaded
instead the right question to ask is why do we humans find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance instead of any of the other possibilities
and again thats a question we can answer
those planets which are much closer to a star like the sun would be so hot that our form of life wouldnt exist
and those planets that are much farther away from the star well theyre so cold that again our form of life would not take hold
so we find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance simply because it yields conditions vital to our form of life
and when it comes to planets and their distances this clearly is the right kind of reasoning
the point is when it comes to universes and the dark energy that they contain it may also be the right kind of reasoning
one key difference of course is we know that there are other planets out there but so far ive only speculated on the possibility that there might be other universes
so to pull it all together we need a mechanism that can actually generate other universes
and that takes me to my final part part three
because such a mechanism has been found by cosmologists trying to understand the big bang
you see when we speak of the big bang we often have an image of a kind of cosmic explosion that created our universe and set space rushing outward
but theres a little secret
the big bang leaves out something pretty important the bang
it tells us how the universe evolved after the bang but gives us no insight into what would have powered the bang itself
and this gap was finally filled by an enhanced version of the big bang theory
its called inflationary cosmology which identified a particular kind of fuel that would naturally generate an outward rush of space
the fuel is based on something called a quantum field but the only detail that matters for us is that this fuel proves to be so efficient that its virtually impossible to use it all up which means in the inflationary theory the big bang giving rise to our universe is likely not a one time event
instead the fuel not only generated our big bang but it would also generate countless other big bangs each giving rise to its own separate universe with our universe becoming but one bubble in a grand cosmic bubble bath of universes
and now when we meld this with string theory heres the picture were led to
each of these universes has extra dimensions
the extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes
the different shapes yield different physical features
and we find ourselves in one universe instead of another simply because its only in our universe that the physical features like the amount of dark energy are right for our form of life to take hold
and this is the compelling but highly controversial picture of the wider cosmos that cutting edge observation and theory have now led us to seriously consider
one big remaining question of course is could we ever confirm the existence of other universes
well let me describe one way that might one day happen
the inflationary theory already has strong observational support
because the theory predicts that the big bang would have been so intense that as space rapidly expanded tiny quantum jitters from the micro world would have been stretched out to the macro world yielding a distinctive fingerprint a pattern of slightly hotter spots and slightly colder spots across space which powerful telescopes have now observed
going further if there are other universes the theory predicts that every so often those universes can collide
and if our universe got hit by another that collision would generate an additional subtle pattern of temperature variations across space that we might one day and so exotic as this picture is it may one day be grounded in observations establishing the existence of other universes
ill conclude with a striking implication of all these ideas for the very far future
you see we learned that our universe is not static that space is expanding that that expansion is speeding up and that there might be other universes all by carefully examining faint pinpoints of starlight coming to us from distant galaxies
but because the expansion is speeding up in the very far future those galaxies will rush away so far and so fast that we wont be able to see them not because of technological limitations but because of the laws of physics
the light those galaxies emit even traveling at the fastest speed the speed of light will not be able to overcome the ever widening gulf between us
so astronomers in the far future looking out into deep space will see nothing but an endless stretch of static inky black stillness
and they will conclude that the universe is static and unchanging and populated by a single central oasis of matter that they inhabit a picture of the cosmos that we definitively know to be wrong
now maybe those future astronomers will have records handed down from an earlier era like ours attesting to an expanding cosmos teeming with galaxies
but would those future astronomers believe such ancient knowledge
or would they believe in the black static empty universe that their own state of the art observations reveal
i suspect the latter
which means that we are living through a remarkably privileged era when certain deep truths about the cosmos are still within reach of the human spirit of exploration
it appears that it may not always be that way
because todays astronomers by turning powerful telescopes to the sky have captured a handful of starkly informative photons a kind of cosmic telegram billions of years in transit
and the message echoing across the ages is clear
sometimes nature guards her secrets with the unbreakable grip of physical law
sometimes the true nature of reality beckons from just beyond the horizon
thank you very much
chris anderson brian thank you
the range of ideas youve just spoken about are dizzying exhilarating incredible
how do you think of where cosmology is now in a sort of historical side
are we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion
bg well its hard to say
when we learn that astronomers of the far future may not have enough information to figure things out the natural question is maybe were already in that position and certain deep critical features of the universe already have escaped our ability to understand because of how cosmology evolves
so from that perspective maybe we will always be asking questions and never be able to fully answer them
on the other hand we now can understand how old the universe is
we can understand how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation that was set down billion years ago and yet we can do calculations today to predict how it will look and it matches
holy cow thats just amazing
so on the one hand its just incredible where weve gotten but who knows what sort of blocks we may find in the future
ca youre going to be around for the next few days
maybe some of these conversations can continue
thank you thank you brian

title michael tilson thomas music and emotion through time title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript in this epic overview michael tilson thomas traces the development of classical music through the development of written notation the record and the re mix description
well when i was asked to do this tedtalk i was really chuckled because you see my fathers name was ted and much of my life especially my musical life is really a talk that im still having with him or the part of me that he continues to be
now ted was a new yorker an all around theater guy and he was a self taught illustrator and musician
he didnt read a note and he was profoundly hearing impaired
yet he was my greatest teacher
because even through the squeaks of his hearing aids his understanding of music was profound
and for him it wasnt so much the way the music goes as about what it witnesses and where it can take you
and he did a painting of this experience which he called in the realm of music
now ted entered this realm every day by improvising in a sort of tin pan alley style like this
but he was tough when it came to music
he said there are only two things that matter in music what and how
and the thing about classical music that what and how its inexhaustible
that was his passion for the music
both my parents really loved it
they didnt know all that much about it but they gave me the opportunity to discover it together with them
and i think inspired by that memory its been my desire to try and bring it to as many other people as i can sort of pass it on through whatever means
and how people get this music how it comes into their lives really fascinates me
one day in new york i was on the street and i saw some kids playing baseball between stoops and cars and fire hydrants
and a tough slouchy kid got up to bat and he took a swing and really connected
and he watched the ball fly for a second and then he went dah dadaratatatah
brah dada dadadadah
and he ran around the bases
and i thought go figure
how did this piece of century austrian aristocratic entertainment turn into the victory crow of this new york kid
how was that passed on how did he get to hear mozart
well when it comes to classical music theres an awful lot to pass on much more than mozart beethoven or tchiakovsky
because classical music is an unbroken living tradition that goes back over years
and every one of those years has had something unique and powerful to say to us about what its like to be alive
now the raw material of it of course is just the music of everyday life
its all the anthems and dance crazes and ballads and marches
but what classical music does is to distill all of these musics down to condense them to their absolute essence and from that essence create a new language a language that speaks very lovingly and unflinchingly about who we really are
its a language thats still evolving
now over the centuries it grew into the big pieces we always think of like concertos and symphonies but even the most ambitious masterpiece can have as its central mission to bring you back to a fragile and personal moment like this one from the beethoven violin concerto
its so simple so evocative
so many emotions seem to be inside of it
yet of course like all music its essentially not about anything
its just a design of pitches and silence and time
and the pitches the notes as you know are just vibrations
theyre locations in the spectrum of sound
and whether we call them per second a or b flat trust me thats right theyre just phenomena
but the way we react to different combinations of these phenomena is complex and emotional and not totally understood
and the way we react to them has changed radically over the centuries as have our preferences for them
so for example in the century people liked pieces that ended like this
and in the century it was more like this
and in the century
now your century ears are quite happy with this last chord even though a while back it would have puzzled or annoyed you or sent some of you running from the room
and the reason you like it is because youve inherited whether you knew it or not centuries worth of changes in musical theory practice and fashion
and in classical music we can follow these changes very very accurately because of the musics powerful silent partner the way its been passed on notation
now the impulse to notate or more exactly i should say encode music in b c a man named sekulos wrote this song for his departed wife and inscribed it on her gravestone in the notational system of the greeks
and a thousand years later this impulse to notate took an entirely different form
and you can see how this happened in these excerpts from the christmas mass puer natus est nobis for us is born
in the century little squiggles were used just to indicate the general shape of the tune
and in the century a line was drawn like a musical horizon line to better pinpoint the pitchs location
and then in the century more lines and new shapes of notes locked in the concept of the tune exactly and that led to the kind of notation we have today
well notation not only passed the music on notating and encoding the music changed its priorities entirely because it enabled the musicians to imagine music on a much vaster scale
now inspired moves of improvisation could be recorded saved considered prioritized made into intricate designs
and from this moment classical music became what it most essentially is a dialogue between the two powerful sides of our nature instinct and intelligence
and there began to be a real difference at this point between the art of improvisation and the art of composition
now an improviser senses and plays the next cool move but a composer is considering all possible moves testing them out prioritizing them out until he sees how they can form a powerful and coherent design of ultimate and enduring coolness
now some of the greatest composers like bach were combinations of these two things
bach was like a great improviser with a mind of a chess master
mozart was the same way
but every musician strikes a different balance between faith and reason instinct and intelligence
and every musical era had different priorities of these things different things to pass on different whats and hows
so in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition the big what was to praise god
and by the music was being written that tried to mirror gods mind as could be seen in the design of the night sky
the how was a style called polyphony music of many independently moving voices that suggested the way the planets seemed to move in ptolemys geocentric universe
this was truly the music of the spheres
this is the kind of music that leonardo davinci would have known
and perhaps its tremendous intellectual perfection and serenity meant that something new had to happen a radical new move which in is what did happen
singer ah bitter blow
ah wicked cruel fate
ah baleful stars
ah avaricious heaven
mtt this of course was the birth of opera and its development put music on a radical new course
the what now was not to mirror the mind of god but to follow the emotion turbulence of man
and the how was harmony stacking up the pitches to form chords
and the chords it turned out were capable of representing incredible varieties of emotions
and the basic chords were the ones we still have with us the triads either the major one which we think is happy or the minor one which we perceive as sad
but whats the actual difference between these two chords
its just these two notes in the middle
its either e natural and vibrations per second or e flat at
so the big difference between human happiness and sadness
freakin vibrations
so you can see in a system like this there was enormous subtle potential of representing human emotions
and in fact as man began to understand more his complex and ambivalent nature harmony grew more complex to reflect it
turns out it was capable of expressing emotions beyond the ability of words
now with all this possibility classical music really took off
its the time in which the big forms began to arise
and the effects of technology began to be felt also because printing put music the scores the codebooks of music into the hands of performers everywhere
and new and improved instruments made the age of the virtuoso possible
this is when those big forms arose the symphonies the sonatas the concertos
and in these big architectures of time composers like beethoven could share the insights of a lifetime
a piece like beethovens fifth basically witnessing how it was possible for him to go from sorrow and anger over the course of a half an hour step by exacting step of his route to the moment when he could make it across to joy
and it turned out the symphony could be used for more complex issues like gripping ones of culture such as nationalism or quest for freedom or the frontiers of sensuality
but whatever direction the music took one thing until recently was always the same and that was when the musicians stopped playing the music stopped
now this moment so fascinates me
i find it such a profound one
what happens when the music stops
where does it go whats left
what sticks with people in the audience at the end of a performance
is it a melody or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude
and how might that change their lives
to me this is the intimate personal side of music
its the passing on part its the why part of it
and to me thats the most essential of all
mostly its been a person to person thing a teacher student performer audience thing and then around came this new technology that first mechanically then through analogs then digitally created a new and miraculous way of passing things on albeit an impersonal one
people could now hear music all the time even though it wasnt necessary for them to play an instrument read music or even go to concerts
and technology democratized music by making everything available
it spearheaded a cultural revolution in which artists like caruso and bessie smith were on the same footing
and technology pushed composers to tremendous extremes using computers and synthesizers to create works of intellectually impenetrable complexity beyond the means of performers and audiences
at the same time technology by taking over the role that notation had always played shifted the balance within music between instinct and intelligence way over to the instinctive side
the culture in which we live now is awash with music of improvisation thats been sliced diced layered and god knows distributed and sold
whats the long term effect of this on us or on music
nobody knows
the question remains what happens when the music stops
what sticks with people
now that we have unlimited access to music what does stick with us
well let me show you a story of what i mean by really sticking with us
i was visiting a cousin of mine in an old age home and i spied a very shaky old man making his way across the room on a walker
he came over to a piano that was there and he balanced himself and began playing something like this
and he said something like me boy symphony beethoven
and i suddenly got it and i said friend by any chance are you trying to play this
and he said yes yes i was a little boy
the symphony isaac stern the concerto i heard it
and i thought my god how much must this music mean to this man that he would get himself out of his bed across the room to recover the memory of this music that after everything else in his life is sloughing away still means so much to him
well thats why i take every performance so seriously why it matters to me so much
i never know who might be there who might be absorbing it and what will happen to it in their life
but now im excited that theres more chance than ever before possible of sharing this music
thats what drives my interest in projects like the tv series keeping score with the san francisco symphony that looks at the backstories of music and working with the young musicians at the new world symphony on projects that explore the potential of the new performing arts centers for both entertainment and education
and of course the new world symphony led to the youtube symphony and projects on the internet that reach out to musicians and audiences all over the world
and the exciting thing is all this is just a prototype
theres just a role here for so many people teachers parents performers to be explorers together
sure the big events attract a lot of attention but what really matters is what goes on every single day
we need your perspectives your curiosity your voices
and it excites me now to meet people who are hikers chefs code writers taxi drivers people i never would have guessed who loved the music and who are passing it on
you dont need to worry about knowing anything
if youre curious if you have a capacity for wonder if youre alive you know all that you need to know
you can start anywhere ramble a bit
follow traces get lost be surprised amused inspired
all that what all that how is out there waiting for you to discover its why to dive in and pass it on
thank you

title boghuma kabisen titanji ethical riddles in hiv research title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript it s an all too common story after participating in an hiv clinical trial a woman in sub saharan africa is left without the resources to buy a bus ticket to her health clinic let alone to afford life saving antiretrovirals boghuma kabisen titanji asks an important question how can researchers looking for a cure make sure they re not taking advantage of those most affected by the pandemic description
id like to share with you the story of one of my patients called celine
celine is a housewife and lives in a rural district of cameroon in west central africa
six years ago at the time of her hiv diagnosis she was recruited to participate in the clinical trial which was running in her health district at the time
when i first met celine a little over a year ago she had gone for months without any antiretroviral therapy and she was very ill
she told me that she stopped coming to the clinic when the trial ended because she had no money for the bus fare and was too ill to walk the kilometer distance
now during the clinical trial shed been given all her antiretroviral drugs free of charge and her transportation costs had been covered by the research funds
all of these ended once the trial was completed leaving celine with no alternatives
she was unable to tell me the names of the drugs shed received during the trial or even what the trial had been about
i didnt bother to ask her what the results of the trial were because it seemed obvious to me that she would have no clue
yet what puzzled me most was celine had given her informed consent to be a part of this trial yet she clearly did not understand the implications of being a participant or what would happen to her once the trial had been completed
now i have shared this story with you as an example of what can happen to participants in the clinical trial when it is poorly conducted
maybe this particular trial yielded exciting results
maybe it even got published in a high profile scientific journal
maybe it would inform clinicians around the world on how to improve on the clinical management of hiv patients
but it would have done so at a price to hundreds of patients who like celine were left to their own devices once the research had been completed
i do not stand here today to suggest in any way that conducting hiv clinical trials in developing countries is bad
on the contrary clinical trials are extremely useful tools and are much needed to address the burden of disease in developing countries
however the inequalities that exist between richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding pose a real risk for exploitation especially in the context of externally funded research
sadly enough the fact remains that a lot of the studies that are conducted in developing countries could never be authorized in the richer countries which fund the research
im sure you must be asking yourselves what makes developing countries especially those in sub saharan africa so attractive for these hiv clinical trials
well in order for a clinical trial to generate valid and widely applicable results they need to be conducted with large numbers of study participants and preferably on a population with a high incidence of new hiv infections
sub saharan africa largely fits this description with million people living with hiv an estimated percent of the million people who are infected worldwide
also research within the continent is a lot easier to conduct due to widespread poverty endemic diseases and inadequate health care systems
a clinical trial that is considered to be potentially beneficial to the population is more likely to be authorized and in the absence of good health care systems almost any offer of medical assistance is accepted as better than nothing
even more problematic reasons include lower risk of litigation less rigorous ethical reviews and populations that are willing to participate in almost any study that hints at a cure
as funding for hiv research increases in developing countries and ethical review in richer countries become more strict you can see why this context becomes very very attractive
the high prevalence of hiv drives researchers to conduct research that is sometimes scientifically acceptable but on many levels ethically questionable
how then can we ensure that in our search for the cure we do not take an unfair advantage of those who are already most affected by the pandemic
i invite you to consider four areas i think we can focus on in order to improve the way in which things are done
the first of these is informed consent
now in order for a clinical trial to be considered ethically acceptable participants must be given the relevant information in a way in which they can understand and must freely consent to participate in the trial
this is especially important in developing countries where a lot of participants consent to research because they believe it is the only way in which they can receive medical care or other benefits
consent procedures that are used in richer countries are often inappropriate or ineffective in a lot of developing countries
for example it is counterintuitive to have an illiterate study participant like celine sign a lengthy consent form that they are unable to read let alone understand
local communities need to be more involved in establishing the criteria for recruiting participants in clinical trials as well as the incentives for participation
the information in these trials needs to be given to the potential participants in linguistically and culturally acceptable formats
the second point i would like for you to consider is the standard of care that is provided to participants within any clinical trial
now this is subject to a lot of debate and controversy
should the control group in the clinical trial be given the best current treatment which is available anywhere in the world
or should they be given an alternative standard of care such as the best current treatment available in the country in which the research is being conducted
is it fair to evaluate a treatment regimen which may not be affordable or accessible to the study participants once the research has been completed
now in a situation where the best current treatment is inexpensive and simple to deliver the answer is straightforward
however the best current treatment available anywhere in the world is often very difficult to provide in developing countries
it is important to assess the potential risks and benefits of the standard of care which is to be provided to participants in any clinical trial and establish one which is relevant for the context of the study and most beneficial for the participants within the study
that brings us to the third point i want you think about the ethical review of research
an effective system for reviewing the ethical suitability of clinical trials is primordial to safeguard participants within any clinical trial
unfortunately this is often lacking or inefficient in a lot of developing countries
local governments need to set up effective systems for reviewing the ethical issues around the clinical trials which are authorized in different developing countries and they need to do this by setting up ethical review committees that are independent of the government and research sponsors
public accountability needs to be promoted through transparency and independent review by nongovernmental and international organizations as appropriate
the final point i would like for you to consider tonight is what happens to participants in the clinical trial once the research has been completed
i think it is absolutely wrong for research to begin in the first place without a clear plan for what would happen to the participants once the trial has ended
now researchers need to make every effort to ensure that an intervention that has been shown to be beneficial during a clinical trial is accessible to the participants of the trial once the trial has been completed
in addition they should be able to consider the possibility of introducing and maintaining effective treatments in the wider community once the trial ends
if for any reason they feel that this might not be possible then i think they should have to ethically justify why the clinical trial should be conducted in the first place
now fortunately for celine our meeting did not end in my office
i was able to get her enrolled into a free hiv treatment program closer to her home and with a support group to help her cope
her story has a positive ending but there are thousands of others in similar situations who are much less fortunate
although she may not know this my encounter with celine has completely changed the way in which i view hiv clinical trials in developing countries and made me even more determined to be part of the movement to change the way in which things are done
i believe that every single person listening to me tonight can be part of that change
if you are a researcher i hold you to a higher standard of moral conscience to remain ethical in your research and not compromise human welfare in your search for answers
if you work for a funding agency or pharmaceutical company i challenge you to hold your employers to fund research that is ethically sound
if you come from a developing country like myself i urge you to hold your government to a more thorough review of the clinical trials which are authorized in your country
yes there is a need for us to find a cure for hiv to find an effective vaccine for malaria to find a diagnostic tool that works for t b but i believe that we owe it to those who willingly and selflessly consent to participate in these clinical trials to do this in a humane way
thank you

title jared diamond how societies can grow old better title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript theres an irony behind the latest efforts to extend human life its no picnic to be an old person in a youth oriented society older people can become isolated lacking meaningful work and low on funds in this intriguing talk jared diamond looks at how many different societies treat their elders some better some worse and suggests we all take advantage of experience description
to give me an idea of how many of you here may find what im about to tell you of practical value let me ask you please to raise your hands who here is either over years old or hopes to live past age or has parents or grandparents who did live or have lived past raise your hands please
okay you are the people to whom my talk the rest of you wont find my talk personally relevant but i think that you will still find the subject fascinating
im going to talk about growing older in traditional societies
this subject constitutes just one chapter of my latest book which compares traditional small tribal societies with our large modern societies with respect to many topics such as bringing up children growing older health dealing with danger settling disputes religion and speaking more than one language
those tribal societies which constituted all human societies for most of human history are far more diverse than are our modern recent big societies
all big societies that have governments and where most people are strangers to each other are inevitably similar to each other and different from tribal societies
tribes constitute thousands of natural experiments in how to run a human society
they constitute experiments from which we ourselves may be able to learn
tribal societies shouldnt be scorned as primitive and miserable but also they shouldnt be romanticized as happy and peaceful
when we learn of tribal practices but there are other tribal practices which when we hear about them we may admire and envy and wonder whether we could adopt those practices ourselves
most old people in the u s end up living separately from their children and from most of their friends of their earlier years and often they live in separate retirements homes for the elderly whereas in traditional societies older people instead live out their lives among their children their other relatives and their lifelong friends
nevertheless the treatment of the elderly varies enormously among traditional societies from much worse to much better than in our modern societies
at the worst extreme many traditional societies get rid of their elderly in one of four increasingly direct ways by neglecting their elderly and not feeding or cleaning them until they die or by abandoning them when the group moves or by encouraging older people to commit suicide or by killing older people
in which tribal societies do children abandon or kill their parents
it happens mainly under two conditions
one is in nomadic hunter gather societies that often shift camp and that are physically incapable of transporting old people who cant walk when the able bodied younger people already have to carry their young children and all their physical possessions
the other condition is in societies living in marginal or fluctuating environments such as the arctic or deserts where there are periodic food shortages and occasionally there just isnt enough food to keep everyone alive
whatever food is available has to be reserved for able bodied adults and for children
to us americans it sounds horrible to think of abandoning or killing your own sick wife or husband or elderly mother or father but what could those traditional societies do differently
they face a cruel situation of no choice
their old people had to do it to their own parents and the old people know what now is going to happen to them
at the opposite extreme in treatment of the elderly the happy extreme are the new guinea farming societies where ive been doing my fieldwork for the past years and most other sedentary traditional societies around the world
in those societies older people are cared for
they are fed they remain valuable
and they continue to live in the same hut or else in a nearby hut near their children relatives and lifelong friends
there are two main sets of reasons for this variation among societies in their treatment of old people
the variation depends especially on the usefulness of old people and on the societys values
first as regards usefulness older people continue to perform useful services
one use of older people in traditional societies is that they often are still effective at producing food
another traditional usefulness of older people is that they are capable of babysitting their grandchildren thereby freeing up their own adult children the parents of those grandchildren to go hunting and gathering food for the grandchildren
still another traditional value of older people is in making tools weapons baskets pots and textiles
in fact theyre usually the people who are best at it
older people usually are the leaders of traditional societies and the people most knowledgeable about politics medicine religion songs and dances
finally older people in traditional societies have a huge significance that would never occur to us in our modern literate societies where our sources of information are books and the internet
in contrast in traditional societies without writing older people are the repositories of information
its their knowledge that spells the difference between survival and death for their whole society in a time of crisis caused by rare events for which only the oldest people alive have had experience
those then are the ways in which older people are useful in traditional societies
their usefulness varies and contributes to variation in the societys treatment of the elderly
the other set of reasons for variation the societys cultural values
for example theres particular emphasis on respect for the elderly in east asia associated with confucius doctrine of filial piety which means obedience respect and support for elderly parents
cultural values that emphasize respect for older people contrast with the low status of the elderly in the u s
older americans are at a big disadvantage in job applications
theyre at a big disadvantage in hospitals
our hospitals have an explicit policy called age based allocation of healthcare resources
that sinister expression means that if hospital resources are limited for example if only one donor heart becomes available for transplant or if a surgeon has time to operate on only a certain number of patients american hospitals have an explicit policy of giving preference to younger patients over older patients on the grounds that younger patients are considered more valuable to society because they have more years of life ahead of them even though the younger patients have fewer years of valuable life experience behind them
there are several reasons for this low status of the elderly in the u s
one is our protestant work ethic which places high value on work so older people who are no longer working arent respected
another reason is our american emphasis on the virtues of self reliance and independence so we instinctively look down on older people who are no longer self reliant and independent
still a third reason is our american cult of youth which shows up even in our advertisements
ads for coca cola and beer always depict smiling young people even though old as well as young people buy and drink coca cola and beer
just think whats the last time you saw a coke or beer ad depicting smiling people years old never
instead the only american ads featuring white haired old people are ads for retirement homes and pension planning
well what has changed in the status of the elderly today compared to their status in traditional societies
there have been a few changes for the better and more changes for the worse
big changes for the better much longer lives much better health in our old age and much better recreational opportunities
another change for the better is that we now have specialized retirement facilities and programs to take care of old people
changes for the worse begin with the cruel reality that we now have more old people and fewer young people than at any time in the past
that means that all those old people are more of a burden on the few young people and that each old person has less individual value
another big change for the worse in the status of the elderly is the breaking of social ties with age because older people their children and their friends all move and scatter independently of each other many times during their lives
we americans move on the average every five years
hence our older people are likely to end up living distant from their children and the friends of their youth
yet another change for the worse in the status of the elderly is formal retirement from the workforce carrying with it a loss of work friendships and a loss of the self esteem associated with work
perhaps the biggest change for the worse is that our elderly are objectively less useful than in traditional societies
widespread literacy means that they are no longer useful as repositories of knowledge
when we want some information we look it up in a book or we google it instead of finding some old person to ask
the slow pace of technological change in traditional societies means that what someone learns there as a child is still useful when that person is old but the rapid pace of technological change today means that what we learn as children is no longer useful years later
and conversely we older people are not fluent in the technologies essential for surviving in modern society
for example as a year old i was considered outstandingly good at multiplying numbers because i had memorized the multiplication tables and i know how to use logarithms and im quick at manipulating a slide rule
today though those skills are utterly useless because any idiot can now multiply eight digit numbers accurately and instantly with a pocket calculator
conversely i at age am incompetent at skills essential for everyday life
my familys first tv set in had only three knobs that i quickly mastered an on off switch a volume knob and a channel selector knob
today just to watch a program on the tv set in my own house i have to operate a button tv remote that utterly defeats me
i have to telephone my year old sons and ask them to talk me through it while i try to push those wretched buttons
what can we do to improve the lives of the elderly in the u s and to make better use of their value
thats a huge problem
in my remaining four minutes today i can offer just a few suggestions
one value of older people is that they are increasingly useful as grandparents for offering high quality childcare to their grandchildren if they choose to do it as more young women enter the workforce and as fewer young parents of either gender stay home as full time caretakers of their children
compared to the usual alternatives of paid babysitters and day care centers grandparents offer superior motivated experienced child care
theyve already gained experience from raising their own children
they usually love their grandchildren and are eager to spend time with them
unlike other caregivers grandparents dont quit their job because they found another job with higher pay looking after another baby
a second value of older people is paradoxically related to their loss of value as a result of changing world conditions and technology
at the same time older people have gained in value today precisely because of their unique experience of living conditions that have now become rare because of rapid change but that could come back
for example only americans now in their or older today can remember the experience of living through a great depression the experience of living through a world war and agonizing whether or not dropping atomic bombs would be more horrible than the likely consequences of not dropping atomic bombs
most of our current voters and politicians have no personal experience of any of those things but millions of older americans do
unfortunately all of those terrible situations could come back
even if they dont come back we have to be able to plan for them on the basis of the experience of what they were like
older people have that experience
younger people dont
the remaining value of older people that ill mention involves recognizing that while there are many things that older people can no longer do there are other things that they can do better than younger people
a challenge for society is to make use of those things that older people are better at doing
some abilities of course decrease with age
those include abilities at tasks requiring physical strength and stamina ambition and the power of novel reasoning in a circumscribed situation such as figuring out the structure of dna best left to scientists under the age of
conversely valuable attributes that increase with age include experience understanding of people and human relationships ability to help other people without your own ego getting in the way and interdisciplinary thinking about large databases such as economics and comparative history best left to scholars over the age of
hence older people are much better than younger people at supervising administering advising strategizing teaching synthesizing and devising long term plans
ive seen this value of older people with so many of my friends in their and who are still active as investment managers farmers lawyers and doctors
in short many traditional societies make better use of their elderly and give their elderly more satisfying lives than we do in modern big societies
paradoxically nowadays when we have more elderly people than ever before living healthier lives and with better medical care than ever before old age is in some respects more miserable than ever before
the lives of the elderly are widely recognized as constituting a disaster area of modern american society
we can surely do better by learning from the lives of the elderly in traditional societies
but whats true of the lives of the elderly in traditional societies is true of many other features of traditional societies as well
of course im not advocating that we all give up agriculture and metal tools and return to a hunter gatherer lifestyle
there are many obvious respects in which our lives today are far happier than those in small traditional societies
to mention just a few examples our lives are longer materially much richer and less plagued by violence than are the lives of people in traditional societies
but there are also things to be admired about people in traditional societies and perhaps to be learned from them
their lives are usually socially much richer than our lives although materially poorer
their children are more self confident more independent and more socially skilled than are our children
they think more realistically about dangers than we do
they almost never die of diabetes heart disease stroke and the other noncommunicable diseases that will be the causes of death of almost all of us in this room today
features of the modern lifestyle predispose us to those diseases and features of the traditional lifestyle protect us against them
those are just some examples of what we can learn from traditional societies
i hope that you will find it as fascinating to read about traditional societies as i found it to live in those societies
thank you

title jae rhim lee my mushroom burial suit title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript heres a powerful provocation from artist jae rhim lee can we commit our bodies to a cleaner greener earth even after death naturally using a special burial suit seeded with pollution gobbling mushrooms yes this just might be the strangest tedtalk youll ever see description
so im here to explain why im wearing these ninja pajamas
and to do that id like to talk first about environmental toxins in our bodies
so some of you may know about the chemical bisphenol a bpa
its a material hardener and synthetic estrogen thats found in the lining of canned foods and some plastics
so bpa mimics the bodys own hormones and causes neurological and reproductive problems
and its everywhere
a recent study found bpa in percent of people six and older
but its just one chemical
the center for disease control in the u s
says we have toxic pollutants in our bodies and this includes preservatives pesticides and heavy metals like lead and mercury
to me this says three things
first dont become a cannibal
second we are both responsible for and the victims of our own pollution
and third our bodies are filters and storehouses for environmental toxins
so what happens to all these toxins when we die
the short answer is they return to the environment in one way or another continuing the cycle of toxicity
but our current funeral practices make the situation much worse
if youre cremated all those toxins i mentioned are released into the atmosphere
and this includes pounds of mercury from our dental fillings alone every year
and in a traditional american funeral a dead body is covered with fillers and cosmetics to make it look alive
its then pumped with toxic formaldehyde to slow decomposition a practice which causes respiratory problems and cancer in funeral personnel
so by trying to preserve our dead bodies we deny death poison the living and further harm the environment
green or natural burials which dont use embalming are a step in the right direction but they dont address the existing toxins in our bodies
i think theres a better solution
im an artist so id like to offer a modest proposal at the intersection of art science and culture
the infinity burial project an alternative burial system that uses mushrooms to decompose and clean toxins in bodies
the infinity burial project began a few years ago with a fantasy to create the infinity mushroom a new hybrid mushroom that would decompose bodies clean the toxins and deliver nutrients to plant roots leaving clean compost
but i learned its nearly impossible to create a new hybrid mushroom
i also learned that some of our tastiest mushrooms can clean environmental toxins in soil
so i thought maybe i could train an army of toxin cleaning edible mushrooms to eat my body
so today im collecting what i shed or slough off my hair skin and nails and im feeding these to edible mushrooms
as the mushrooms grow i pick the best feeders to become infinity mushrooms
its a kind of imprinting and selective breeding process for the afterlife
so when i die the infinity mushrooms will recognize my body and be able to eat it
all right so for some of you this may be really really out there
just a little
i realize this is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to have with our food
we want to eat not be eaten by our food
but as i watch the mushrooms grow and digest my body i imagine the infinity mushroom as a symbol of a new way of thinking about death and the relationship between my body and the environment
see for me cultivating the infinity mushroom is more than just scientific experimentation or gardening or raising a pet its a step towards accepting the fact that someday i will die and decay
its also a step towards taking responsibility for my own burden on the planet
growing a mushroom is also part of a larger practice of cultivating decomposing organisms called decompiculture a concept that was developed by an entomologist timothy myles
the infinity mushroom is a subset of decompiculture im calling body decompiculture and toxin remediation the cultivation of organisms that decompose and clean toxins in bodies
and now about these ninja pajamas
once its completed i plan to integrate the infinity mushrooms into a number of objects
first a burial suit infused with mushroom spores the mushroom death suit
im wearing the second prototype of this burial suit
its covered with a crocheted netting that is embedded with mushroom spores
the dendritic pattern you see mimics the growth of mushroom mycelia which are the equivalent of plant roots
im also making a decompiculture kit a cocktail of capsules that contain infinity mushroom spores and other elements that speed decomposition and toxin remediation
these capsules are embedded in a nutrient rich jelly a kind of second skin which dissolves quickly and becomes baby food for the growing mushrooms
so i plan to finish the mushroom and decompiculture kit in the next year or two and then id like to begin testing them first with expired meat from the market and then with human subjects
and believe it or not a few people have offered to donate their bodies to the project to be eaten by mushrooms
what ive learned from talking to these folks is that we share a common desire to understand and accept death and to minimize the impact of our death on the environment
i wanted to cultivate this perspective just like the mushrooms so i formed the decompiculture society a group of people called decompinauts who actively explore their postmortem options seek death acceptance and cultivate decomposing organisms like the infinity mushroom
the decompiculture society shares a vision of a cultural shift from our current culture of death denial and body preservation to one of decompiculture a radical acceptance of death and decomposition
accepting death means accepting that we are physical beings who are intimately connected to the environment as the research on environmental toxins confirms
and the saying goes we came from dust and will return to dust
and once we understand that were connected to the environment we see that the survival of our species depends on the survival of the planet
i believe this is the beginning of true environmental responsibility

title jonathan klein photos that changed the world title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript photographs do more than document history they make it at ted university jonathan klein of getty images shows some of the most iconic and talks about what happens when a generation sees an image so powerful it cant look away or back description
in my industry we believe that images can change the world
okay were naive were bright eyed and bushy tailed
the truth is that we know that the images themselves dont change the world but were also aware that since the beginning of photography images have provoked reactions in people and those reactions have caused change to happen
so lets begin with a group of images
id be extremely surprised if you didnt recognize many or most of them
theyre best described as iconic so iconic perhaps theyre cliches
in fact theyre so well known that you might even recognize them in a slightly or somewhat different form
but i think were looking for something more
were looking for something more
were looking for images that shine an uncompromising light on crucial issues images that transcend borders that transcend religions images that provoke us to step up and do something in other words to act
well this image youve all seen
it changed our view of the physical world
we had never seen our planet from this perspective before
many people credit a lot of the birth of the environmental movement to our seeing the planet like this for the first time its smallness its fragility
forty years later this group more than most are well aware of the destructive power that our species can wield over our environment
and at last we appear to be doing something about it
this destructive power takes many different forms
for example these images taken by brent stirton in the congo
these gorillas were murdered some would even say crucified and unsurprisingly they sparked international outrage
most recently weve been tragically reminded of the destructive power of nature itself with the recent earthquake in haiti
well i think what is far worse is mans destructive power over man
samuel pisar an auschwitz survivor said and ill quote him the holocaust teaches us that nature even in its cruelest moments is benign in comparison with man when he loses his moral compass and his reason
theres another kind of crucifixion
the horrifying images from abu ghraib as well as the images from guantanamo had a profound impact
the publication of those images as opposed to the images themselves caused a government to change its policies
some would argue that it is those images that did more to fuel the insurgency in iraq than virtually any other single act
furthermore those images forever removed the so called moral high ground of the occupying forces
lets go back a little
in the and the vietnam war was basically shown in americas living rooms day in day out
news photos brought people face to face with the victims of the war a little girl burned by napalm a student killed by the national guard at kent state university in ohio during a protest
in fact these images became the voices of protest themselves
now images have power to shed light of understanding on suspicion ignorance and in particular ive given a lot of talks on this but ill just show one image the issue of hiv aids
in the the stigmatization of people with the disease to even discussing or addressing it
a simple act in of the most famous woman in the world the princess of wales touching an hiv aids infected baby did a great deal especially in europe to stop that
she better than most knew the power of an image
so when we are confronted by a powerful image we all have a choice we can look away or we can address the image
thankfully when these photos appeared in the guardian in they put a lot of focus and attention and in the end a lot of money towards the sudan famine relief efforts
did the images change the world
no but they had a major impact
images often push us to question our core beliefs and our responsibilities to each other
we all saw those images after katrina and i think for millions of people they had a very strong impact
and i think its very unlikely that they were far from the minds of americans when they went to vote in november
unfortunately some very important images are deemed too graphic or disturbing for us to see them
ill show you one photo here and its a photo by eugene richards of an iraq war veteran from an extraordinary piece of work which has never been published called war is personal
but images dont need to be graphic in order to remind us of the tragedy of war
john moore set up this photo at arlington cemetery
after all the tense moments of conflict in all the conflict zones of the world theres one photograph from a much quieter place that haunts me still much more than the others
ansel adams said and im going to disagree with him you dont take a photograph you make it
in my view its not the photographer who makes the photo its you
we bring to each image our own values our own belief systems and as a result of that the image resonates with us
my company has million images
i have one image in my office
here it is
i hope that the next time you see an image that sparks something in you youll better understand why and i know that speaking to this audience youll definitely do something about it
and thank you to all the photographers

title doris kearns goodwin lessons from past presidents title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript historian doris kearns goodwin talks about what we can learn from american presidents including abraham lincoln and lyndon johnson then she shares a moving memory of her own father and of their shared love of baseball description
so indeed i have spent my life looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive
waking up with abraham lincoln in the morning thinking of franklin roosevelt when i went to bed at night
but when i try and think about what ive learned about the meaning in life my mind keeps wandering back to a seminar that i took when i was a graduate student at harvard with the great psychologist erik erikson
he taught us that the richest and fullest lives attempt to achieve an inner balance between three realms work love and play
and that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the other is to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age
whereas to pursue all three with equal dedication is to make possible a life filled not only with achievement but with serenity
so since i tell stories let me look back on the lives of two of the presidents ive studied to illustrate this point abraham lincoln and lyndon johnson
as for that first sphere of work i think what abraham lincolns life suggests is that fierce ambition is a good thing
he had a huge ambition
but it wasnt simply for office or power or celebrity or fame what it was for was to accomplish something worthy enough in life so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it
even as a child it seemed lincoln dreamed heroic dreams
he somehow had to escape that hard scrabble farm from which he was born
no schooling was possible for him except a few weeks here a few weeks there
but he read books in every spare moment he could find
it was said when he got a copy of the king james bible or aesops fables he was so excited he couldnt sleep
he couldnt eat
the great poet emily dickinson once said there is no frigate like a book to take us lands away
how true for lincoln
though he never would travel to europe he went with shakespeares kings to merry england he went with lord byrons poetry to spain and portugal
literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings
but there were so many losses in his early life that he was haunted by death
his mother died when he was only nine years old his only sister sarah in childbirth a few years later and his first love ann rutledge at the age of
moreover when his mother lay dying she did not hold out for him the hope that they would meet in an afterworld
she simply said to him abraham im going away from you now and i shall never return
as a result he became obsessed with the thought that when we die our life is swept away dust to dust
but only as he grew older did he develop a certain consolation from an ancient greek notion but followed by other cultures as well that if you could accomplish something worthy in your life you could live on in the memory of others
your honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence
and that worthy ambition became his lodestar
it carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered when he was in his early
three things had combined to lay him low
he had broken his engagement with mary todd not certain he was ready to marry her but knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that
his one intimate friend joshua speed was leaving illinois to go back to kentucky because speeds father had died
and his political career in the state legislature was on a downward slide
he was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal
they took all knives and razors and scissors from his room
and his great friend speed went to his side and said lincoln you must rally or you will die
he said that i would just as soon die right now but ive not yet done anything to make any human being remember that i have lived
so fueled by that ambition he returned to the state legislature
he eventually won a seat in congress
he then ran twice for the senate lost twice
everyone is broken by life ernest hemingway once said but some people are stronger in the broken places
so then he surprised the nation with an upset victory for the presidency over three far more experienced far more educated far more celebrated rivals
and then when he won the general election he stunned the nation even more by appointing each of these three rivals into his cabinet
it was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought hell look like a figurehead compared to these people
they said why are you doing this lincoln
he said look these are the strongest and most able men in the country
the country is in peril i need them by my side
but perhaps my old friend lyndon johnson might have put it in less noble fashion better to have your enemies inside the tent pissing out than outside the tent pissing in
but it soon became clear that abraham lincoln would emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team
for each of them soon came to understand that he possessed an unparalleled array of emotional strengths and political skills that proved far more important than the thinness of his external résumé
for one thing he possessed an uncanny ability to empathize with and to think about other peoples point of view
he repaired injured feelings that might have escalated into permanent hostility
he shared credit with ease assumed responsibility for the failure of his subordinates constantly acknowledged his errors and learned from his mistakes
these are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in
he refused to be provoked by petty grievances
he never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights
and he expressed his unshakeable convictions in everyday language in metaphors in stories
and with a beauty of language almost as if the shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child had worked their way into his very soul
in when the emancipation proclamation was signed he brought his old friend joshua speed back to the white house and remembered that conversation of decades before when he was so sad
and he pointing to the proclamation said i believe in this measure my fondest hopes will be realized
but as he was about to put his signature on the proclamation his own hand was numb and shaking because he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a new years reception
so he put the pen down
he said if ever my soul were in an act it is in this act
but if i sign with a shaking hand posterity will say he hesitated so he waited until he could take up the pen and sign with a bold and clear hand
but even in his wildest dreams lincoln could never have imagined how far his reputation would reach
i was so thrilled to find an interview with the great russian writer leo tolstoy in a new york newspaper in the early
and in it tolstoy told of a trip that hed recently made to a very remote area of the caucasus where there were only wild barbarians who had never left this part of russia
knowing that tolstoy was in their midst they asked him to tell stories of the great men of history
so he said i told them about napoleon and alexander the great and frederick the great and julius caesar and they loved it
but before i finished the chief of the barbarians stood up and said but wait you havent told us about the greatest ruler of them all
we want to hear about that man who spoke with a voice of thunder who laughed like the sunrise who came from that place called america which is so far from here that if a young man should travel there he would be an old man when he arrived
tell us of that man tell us of abraham lincoln he was stunned
he told them everything he could about lincoln
and then in the interview he said what made lincoln so great
not as great a general as napoleon not as great a statesman as frederick the great
but his greatness consisted and historians would roundly agree in the integrity of his character and the moral fiber of his being
so in the end that powerful ambition that had carried lincoln through his bleak childhood had been realized
that ambition that had allowed him to laboriously educate himself by himself to go through that string of political failures and the darkest days of the war
his story would be told
so as for that second sphere not of work but of love encompassing family friends and colleagues it too takes work and commitment
the lyndon johnson that i saw in the last years of his life when i helped him on his memoirs was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of work power and individual success that he had absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left to get him through the days once the presidency was gone
my relationship with him began on a rather curious level
i was selected as a white house fellow when i was years old
we had a big dance at the white house
president johnson did dance with me that night
not that peculiar there were only three women out of the white house fellows
but he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me to work directly for him in the white house
but it was not to be that simple
for in the months leading up to my selection like many young people id been active in the anti vietnam war movement and had written an article against lyndon johnson which unfortunately came out in the new republic two days after the dance in the white house
and the theme of the article was how to remove lyndon johnson from power
so i was certain he would kick me out of the program
but instead surprisingly he said oh bring her down here for a year and if i cant win her over no one can
so i did end up working for him in the white house
eventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs never fully understanding why hed chosen me to spend so many hours with
i like to believe it was because i was a good listener
he was a great storyteller
fabulous colorful anecdotal stories
there was a problem with these stories however which i later discovered which is that half of them werent true
but they were great nonetheless
so i think that part of his attraction for me was that i loved listening to his tall tales
but i also worried that part of it was that i was then a young woman
and he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation
so i constantly chatted to him about boyfriends even when i didnt have any at all
everything was working perfectly until one day he said he wanted to discuss our relationship
sounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake conveniently called lake lyndon baines johnson
and there was wine and cheese and a red checked tablecloth all the romantic trappings
and he started out doris more than any other woman i have ever known and my heart sank
and then he said you remind me of my mother
it was pretty embarrassing given what was going on in my mind
but i must say the older ive gotten the more i realize what an incredible privilege it was to have spent so many hours with this aging lion of a man
a victor in a thousand contests three great civil rights laws medicare aid to education
and yet roundly defeated in the end by the war in vietnam
and because he was so sad and so vulnerable he opened up to me in ways he never would have had i known him at the height of his power sharing his fears his sorrows and his worries
and id like to believe that the privilege fired within me the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure that ive tried to bring to each of my books since then
but it also brought home to me the lessons which erik erikson had tried to instill in all of us about the importance of finding balance in life
for on the surface lyndon johnson should have had everything in the world to feel good about in those last years in the sense that he had been elected to the presidency he had all the money he needed to pursue any leisure activity he wanted he owned a spacious ranch in the countryside a penthouse in the city sailboats speedboats
he had servants to answer any whim and he had a family who loved him deeply
and yet years of concentration solely on work and individual success meant that in his retirement he could find no solace in family in recreation in sports or in hobbies
it was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large that even the love of a family without work could not fill it
as his spirits sagged his body deteriorated until i believe he slowly brought about his own death
in those last years he said he was so sad watching the american people look toward a new president and forgetting him
he spoke with immense sadness in his voice saying maybe he should have spent more time with his children and their children in turn
but it was too late
despite all that power all that wealth he was alone when he finally died his ultimate terror realized
so as for that third sphere of play which he never had learned to enjoy ive learned over the years that even this sphere requires a commitment of time and energy enough so that a hobby a sport a love of music or art or literature or any form of recreation can provide true pleasure relaxation and replenishment
so deep for instance was abraham lincolns love of shakespeare that he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theater even during those dark days of the war
he said when the lights went down and a shakespeare play came on for a few precious hours he could imagine himself back in prince hals time
but an even more important form of relaxation for him that lyndon johnson never could enjoy was a love of somehow humor and feeling out what hilarious parts of life can produce as a sidelight to the sadness
he once said that he laughed so he did not cry that a good story for him was better than a drop of whiskey
his storytelling powers had first been recognized when he was on the circuit in illinois
the lawyers and the judges would travel from one county courthouse to the other and when anyone was knowing lincoln was in town they would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories
he would stand with his back against a fire and entertain the crowd for hours with his winding tales
and all these stories became part of his memory bank so he could call on them whenever he needed to
and theyre not quite what you might expect from our marble monument
one of his favorite stories for example had to do with the revolutionary war hero ethan allen
and as lincoln told the story mr allen went to britain after the war
and the british people were still upset about losing the revolution so they decided to embarrass him a little bit by putting a huge picture of general washington in the only outhouse where hed have to encounter it
they figured hed be upset about the indignity of george washington being in an outhouse
but he came out of the outhouse not upset at all
and so they said well did you see george washington in there
oh yes he said perfectly appropriate place for him
what do you mean they said
well he said theres nothing to make an englishman shit faster than the sight of general george washington
so you can imagine if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting and he had hundreds of these stories you would have to relax
so between his nightly treks to the theater his story telling and his extraordinary sense of humor and his love of quoting shakespeare and poetry he found that form of play which carried him through his days
in my own life i shall always be grateful for having found a form of play in my irrational love of baseball
which allows me from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall to have something to occupy my mind and heart other than my work
it all began when i was only six years old and my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score while listening to baseball games so that when he went to work in new york during the day i could record for him the history of that afternoons brooklyn dodgers game
now when youre only six years old and your father comes home every single night and listens to you as i now realize that i in excruciating detail recounted every single play of every inning of the game that had just taken place that afternoon
but he made me feel i was telling him a fabulous story
it makes you think theres something magic about history to keep your fathers attention
in fact im convinced i learned the narrative art from those nightly sessions with my father
because at first id be so excited i would blurt out the dodgers won or the dodgers lost
which took much of the drama of this two hour telling away
so i finally learned you had to tell a story from beginning to middle to end
i must say so fervent was my love of the old brooklyn dodgers in those days that i had to confess in my first confession two sins that related to baseball
the first occurred because the dodgers catcher roy campanella came to my hometown of rockville centre long island just as i was in preparation for my first holy communion
and i was so excited first person id ever see outside of ebbets field
but it so happened he was speaking in a protestant church
when you are brought up as a catholic you think that if you ever set foot in a protestant church youll be struck dead at the threshold
so i went to my father in tears what are we going to do
he said dont worry hes speaking in a parish hall
were sitting in folding chairs hes talking about sportsmanship
its not a sin
but as i left that night i was certain that somehow id traded the life of my everlasting soul for this one night with roy campanella
and there were no indulgences around that i could buy
so i had this sin on my soul when i went to my first confession
i told the priest right away
he said no problem it wasnt a religious service
but then unfortunately he said and what else my child
and then came my second sin
i tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church wishing harm to others being mean to my sisters
and he said to whom did you wish harm
and i had to say that i wished that various new york yankees players would break arms legs and ankles so that the brooklyn dodgers could win their first world series
he said how often do you make these horrible wishes
and i had to say every night when i said my prayers
so he said look ill tell you something
i love the brooklyn dodgers as you do but i promise you some day they will win fairly and squarely
you do not need to wish harm on others to make it happen
oh yes i said
but luckily my first confession to a baseball loving priest
well though my father died of a sudden heart attack when i was still in my before i had gotten married and had my three sons i have passed his memory as well as his love of baseball on to my boys
though when the dodgers abandoned us to come to l a i lost faith in baseball until i moved to boston and became an irrational red socks fan
and i must say even now when i sit with my sons with our season tickets i can sometimes close my eyes against the sun and imagine myself a young girl once more in the presence of my father watching the players of my youth on the grassy fields below jackie robinson roy campanella pee wee reese and duke snider
i must say there is magic in these moments
when i open my eyes and i see my sons in the place where my father once sat i feel an invisible loyalty and love linking my sons to the grandfather whose face they never had a chance to see but whose heart and soul they have come to know through all the stories i have told
which is why in the end i shall always be grateful for this curious love of history allowing me to spend a lifetime looking back into the past
allowing me to learn from these large figures about the struggle for meaning for life
allowing me to believe that the private people we have loved and lost in our families and the public figures we have respected in our history just as abraham lincoln wanted to believe really can live on so long as we pledge to tell and to retell the stories of their lives
thank you for letting me be that storyteller today
thank you

title john hunter teaching with the world peace game title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript john hunter puts all the problems of the world on a plywood board and lets his graders solve them at he explains how his world peace game engages schoolkids and why the complex lessons it teaches spontaneous and always surprising go further than classroom lectures can description
im very fortunate to be here
i feel so fortunate
ive been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me
i called my wife leslie and i said you know theres so many good people trying to do so much good
it feels like ive landed in a colony of angels
its a true feeling
but let me get to the talk i see the clock is running
im a public school teacher and i just want to share a story of my superintendent
her name is pam moran in albemarle county virginia the foothills of the blue ridge mountains
and shes a very high tech superintendent
she uses smart boards she blogs she tweets she does facebook she does all this sort of high tech stuff
shes a technology leader and instructional leader
but in her office theres this old wooden weather worn table kitchen table peeling green paint its kind of rickety
and i said pam youre such a modern cutting edge person
why is this old table in your office
and she told me she said you know i grew up in southwestern virginia in the coal mines and the farmlands of rural virginia and this table was in my grandfathers kitchen
and wed come in from playing hed come in from plowing and working and wed sit around that table every night
and as i grew up i heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table i began to call it the wisdom table
and when he passed on i took this table with me and brought it to my office and it reminds me of him
it reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes
the project im going to tell you about is called the world peace game and essentially it is also an empty space
and id like to think of it as a century wisdom table really
it all started back in
i was a young man and i had been dropping in and out of college
and my parents were very patient but i had been doing intermittent sojourns to india on a mystical quest
and i remember the last time i came back from india in my long white flowing robes and my big beard and my john lennon glasses and i said to my father dad i think ive just about found spiritual enlightenment
he said well theres one more thing you need to find
i said what is that dad a job
and so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something
so i got a degree and it turned out to be education
it was an experimental education program
it could have been dentistry but the word experimental was in it and so thats what i had to go for
and i went in for a job interview in the richmond public schools in virginia the capital city bought a three piece suit my concession to convention kept my long beard and my afro and my platform shoes at the time it was the and i walked in and i sat down and had an interview
and i guess they were hard up for teachers because the supervisor her name was anna aro said i had the job teaching gifted children
and i was so shocked so stunned i got up and said well thank you but what do i do
gifted education hadnt really taken hold too much
there werent really many materials or things to use
and i said what do i do
and her answer shocked me it stunned me
her answer set the template for the entire career i was to have after that
she said what do you want to do
and that question cleared the space
there was no program directive no manual to follow no standards in gifted education in that way
and she cleared such a space that i endeavored from then on to clear a space for my students an empty space whereby they could create and make meaning out of their own understanding
so this happened in and i was teaching many years later and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker
his name is chris farina
chris farina is here today at his own cost
chris could you stand up and let them see you a young visionary filmmaker whos made a film
this film is called world peace and other grade achievements
he proposed the film to me its a great title
he proposed the film to me and i said yeah maybe itll be on local tv and we can say hi to our friends
but the film has really gone places
now its still in debt but chris has managed through his own sacrifice to get this film out
so we made a film and it turns out to be more than a story about me more than a story about one teacher
its a story thats a testament to teaching and teachers
and its a beautiful thing
and the strange thing is when i watch the film i have the eerie sensation of seeing it i saw myself literally disappear
what i saw was my teachers coming through me
i saw my geometry teacher in high school mr rucells wry smile under his handlebar mustache
thats the smile i use thats his smile
i saw jan polos flashing eyes
and they werent flashing in anger they were flashing in love intense love for her students
and i have that kind of flash sometimes
and i saw miss ethel j banks who wore pearls and high heels to elementary school every day
and you know she had that old school teacher stare
you know the one
and im not even talking about you behind me because ive got eyes in the back of my head
you know that teacher
i didnt use that stare very often but i do have it in my repertoire
and miss banks was there as a great mentor for me
and then i saw my own parents my first teachers
my father very inventive spatial thinker
thats my brother malcolm there on the right
and my mother who taught me in fourth grade in segregated schools in virginia who was my inspiration
and really i feel as though when i see the film i have a gesture she does like this i feel like i am a continuation of her gesture
i am one of her teaching gestures
and the beautiful thing was i got to teach my daughter in elementary school madeline
and so that gesture of my mothers continues through many generations
its an amazing feeling to have that lineage
and so im here standing on the shoulders of many people
im not here alone
there are many people on this stage right now
and so this world peace game id like to tell you about
it started out like this its just a four foot by five foot plywood board in an inner city urban school
i was creating a lesson for students on africa
we put all the problems of the world there and i thought lets let them solve it
i didnt want to lecture or have just book reading
i wanted to have them be immersed and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies
so i thought well they like to play games
ill make something i didnt say interactive we didnt have that term in but something interactive
and so we made the game and it has since evolved to a four foot by four foot by four foot plexiglass structure
and it has four plexiglass layers
theres an outer space layer with black holes and satellites and research satellites and asteroid mining
theres an air and space level with clouds that are big puffs of cotton we push around and territorial air spaces and air forces a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it even an undersea level with submarines and undersea mining
there are four countries around the board
the kids make up the names of the countries some are rich some are poor
they have different assets commercial and military
and each country has a cabinet
theres a prime minister secretary of state minister of defense and a cfo or comptroller
i choose the prime minister based on my relationship with them
i offer them the job they can turn it down and then they choose their own cabinet
theres a world bank arms dealers and a united nations
theres also a weather goddess who controls a random stock market and random weather
thats not all
and then theres a page crisis document with interlocking problems
so that if one thing changes everything else changes
i throw them into this complex matrix and they trust me because we have a deep rich relationship together
and so with all these crises we have lets see ethnic and minority tensions we have chemical and nuclear spills nuclear proliferation
theres oil spills environmental disasters water rights disputes breakaway republics famine endangered species and global warming
if al gore is here im going to send my fourth graders from agnor hurt and venable schools to you because they solved global warming in a week
and theyve done it several times too
so i also have in the game a saboteur some child its basically a troublemaker and i have my troublemaker put to use because they on the surface are trying to save the world and their position in the game
but theyre also trying to undermine everything in the game
and they do it secretly through misinformation and ambiguities and irrelevancies trying to cause everyone to think more deeply
the saboteur is there and we also read from sun tzus the art of war
fourth graders understand it nine years old and they handle that and use that to understand how to not follow at first they do the paths to power and destruction the path to war
they learn to overlook short sighted reactions and impulsive thinking to think in a long term more consequential way
stewart brand is here and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a coevolution quarterly article on a peace force
and in the game sometimes students actually form a peace force
im just a clock watcher
im just a clarifier im just a facilitator
the students run the game
i have no chance to make any policy whatsoever once they start playing
so ill just share with you
boy the world peace game is serious
youre actually getting taught something like how to take care of the world
see mr hunter is doing that because he says his time has messed up a lot and hes trying to tell us how to fix that problem
john hunter i offered them a actually i cant tell them anything because i dont know the answer
and i admit the truth to them right up front i dont know
and because i dont know theyve got to dig up the answer
and so i apologize to them as well
i say im so sorry boys and girls but the truth is we have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape and we hope you can fix it for us and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it
its a sincere apology and they take it very seriously
now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like
well when we have the game start heres what you see
jh all right were going into negotiations as of now go
jh my question to you is whos in charge of that classroom
its a serious question who is really in charge
ive learned to cede control of the classroom over to the students over time
theres a trust and an understanding and a dedication to an ideal that i simply dont have to do what i thought i had to do as a beginning teacher control every conversation and response in the classroom
its impossible their collective wisdom is much greater than mine and i admit it to them openly
so ill just share with you some stories very quickly of some magical things that have happened
in this game we had a little girl and she was the defense minister of the poorest nation
and the defense minister she had the tank corps and air force and so forth
and she was next door to a very wealthy oil rich neighbor
without provocation suddenly she attacked against her prime ministers orders the next door neighbors oil fields
she marched into the oil field reserves surrounded it without firing a shot and secured it and held it
and that neighbor was unable to conduct any military operations because their fuel supply was locked up
we were all upset with her why are you doing this
this is the world peace game what is wrong with you
this was a little girl and at nine years old she held her pieces and said i know what im doing
to her girlfriends she said that
thats a breach there
and we learned in this you dont really ever want to cross a nine year old girl with tanks
they are the toughest opponents
and we were very upset
i thought i was failing as a teacher why would she do this
but come to find out a few game days later and there are turns where we take negotiation from a team actually theres a negotiation period with all teams and each team takes a turn then we go back in negotiation around and around so each turn around is one game day
so a few game days later it came to light that we found out this major country was planning a military offensive to dominate the entire world
had they had their fuel supplies they would have done it
she was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a philosophical decision to attack in a peace game
now she used a small war to avert a larger war so we stopped and had a very good philosophical discussion about whether that was right conditional good or not right
thats the kind of thinking that we put them in the situations
i could not have designed that in teaching it
it came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom
another example a beautiful thing happened
we have a letter in the game
if youre a military commander and you wage troops the little plastic toys on the board and you lose them i put in a letter
you have to write a letter to their parents the fictional parents of your fictional troops explaining what happened and offering your condolences
so you have a little bit more thought before you commit to combat
and so we had this situation come up last summer actually at agnor hurt school in albemarle county and one of our military commanders got up to read that letter and one of the other kids said mr hunter lets ask theres a parent over there
there was a parent visiting that day just sitting in the back of the room
lets ask that mom to read the letter
itll be more realer if she reads it
so we did we asked her and she gamely picked up the letter
sure she started reading she read one sentence
she read two sentences
by the third sentence she was in tears
i was in tears
everybody understood that when we lose somebody the winners are not gloating
we all lose
and it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding
ill show you what my friend david says about this
hes been in many battles
david weve really had enough of people attacking
i mean weve been lucky the time
but now im feeling really weird because im living what sun tzu said one week
one week he said those who go into battle and win will want to go back and those who lose in battle will want to go back and win
and so ive been winning battles so im going into battles more battles
and i think its sort of weird to be living what sun tzu said
jh i get chills every time i see that
thats the kind of engagement you want to have happen
and i cant design that i cant plan that and i cant even test that
but its self evident assessment
we know thats an authentic assessment of learning
we have a lot of data but i think sometimes we go beyond data with the real truth of whats going on
so ill just share a third story
this is about my friend brennan
we had played the game one session after school for many weeks about seven weeks and we had essentially solved all of the interlocking crises
the way the game is won is all problems have to be solved and every countrys asset value has to be increased above its starting point
some are poor some are wealthy there are billions
the world bank president was a third grader one time
he says how many zeros in a trillion ive got to calculate that right away
but he was setting fiscal policy in that game for high school players who were playing with him
so the team that was the poorest had gotten even poorer
there was no way they could win
and we were approaching four oclock our cut off time there was about a minute left and despair just settled over the room
i thought im failing as a teacher
i should have gotten it so they could have won
they shouldnt be failing like this
ive failed them
and i was just feeling so sad and dejected
and suddenly brennan walked over to my chair and he grabbed the bell the bell i ring to signal a change or a reconvening of cabinets and he ran back to his seat rang the bell
everybody ran to his chair there was screaming there was yelling waving of their dossiers
they get these dossiers full of secret documents
they were gesticulating they were running around
i didnt know what they were doing id lost control of my classroom
principal walks in im out of a job
the parents were looking in the window
and brennan runs back to his seat everybody runs back to their seat
he rings the bell again he says we have and theres seconds left on the clock we have all nations pooled all our funds together
and weve got billion dollars
were going to offer it as a donation to this poor country
and if they accept it itll raise their asset value and we can win the game
will you accept it
and there are three seconds left on the clock
everybody looks at this prime minister of that country and he says yes
and the game is won
spontaneous compassion that could not be planned for that was unexpected and unpredictable
every game we play is different
some games are more about social issues some are more about economic issues
some games are more about warfare
but i dont try to deny them that reality of being human
i allow them to go there and through their own experience learn in a bloodless way how not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing
and they find out what is right their own way their own selves
and so in this game ive learned so much from it but i would say that if only they could pick up a critical thinking tool or creative thinking tool from this game and leverage something good for the world they may save us all
if only
and on behalf of all of my teachers on whose shoulders im standing thank you thank you thank you

title clay shirky institutions vs collaboration title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript in this prescient talk clay shirky shows how closed groups and companies will give way to looser networks where small contributors have big roles and fluid cooperation replaces rigid planning description
how do groups get anything done right
how do you organize a group of individuals so that the output of the group is something coherent and of lasting value instead of just being chaos
and the economic framing of that problem is called coordination costs
and a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial or institutional difficulties in arranging group output
and weve had a classic answer for coordination costs which is if you want to coordinate the work of a group of people you start an institution right you raise some resources
you found something it can be private or public
it can be for profit or not profit it can be large or small
but you get these resources together
you found an institution and you use the institution to coordinate the activities of the group
more recently because the cost of letting groups communicate with each other has fallen through the floor and communication costs are one of the big inputs to coordination there has been a second answer which is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure to design systems that coordinate the output of the group as a by product of the operating of the system without regard to institutional models
so thats what i want to talk about today
im going to illustrate it with some fairly concrete examples but always pointing to the broader themes
so im going to start by trying to answer a question that i know each of you will have asked yourself at some point or other and which the internet is purpose built to answer which is where can i get a picture of a roller skating mermaid
so in new york city on the first saturday of every summer coney island our local charmingly run down amusement park hosts the mermaid parade its an amateur parade people come from all over the city people get all dressed up
some people get less dressed up
young and old dancing in the streets
colorful characters and a good time is had by all
and what i want to call your attention to is not the mermaid parade itself charming though it is but rather to these photos
i didnt take them how did i get them
and the answer is i got them from flickr
flickr is a photo sharing service that allows people to take photos upload them share them over the web and so forth
recently flickr has added an additional function called tagging
tagging was pioneered by delicious and joshua schachter
delicious is a social bookmarking service
tagging is a cooperative infrastructure answer to classification
right if i had given this talk last year i couldnt do what i just did because i couldnt have found those photos
but instead of saying we need to hire a professional class of librarians to organize these photos once theyre uploaded flickr simply turned over to the users the ability to characterize the photos
so i was able to go in and draw down photos that had been tagged mermaid parade there were photos taken by photographers all aggregated and then put under this nice neat name shown in reverse chronological order
and i was then able to go and retrieve them to give you that little slideshow
now what hard problem is being solved here
and its in the most schematic possible view its a coordination problem right
there are a large number of people on the internet a very small fraction of them have photos of the mermaid parade
how do we get those people together to contribute that work
the classic answer is to form an institution right
to draw those people into some prearranged structure that has explicit goals
and i want to call your attention to some of the side effects of going the institutional route
first of all when you form an institution you take on a management problem right
no good just hiring employees you also have to hire other employees to manage those employees and to enforce the goals of the institution and so forth
secondly you have to bring structure into place
right you have to have economic structure
you have to have legal structure
you have to have physical structure
and that creates additional costs
third forming an institution is inherently exclusionary
you notice we havent got everybody who has a photo
you cant hire everyone in a company right
you cant recruit everyone into a governmental organization
you have to exclude some people
and fourth as a result of that exclusion you end up with a professional class look at the change here
weve gone from people with photos to photographers
right weve created a professional class of photographers whose goal is to go out and photograph the mermaid parade or whatever else theyre sent out to photograph
when you build cooperation into the infrastructure which is the flickr answer you can leave the people where they are and you take the problem to the individuals rather than moving the individuals to the problem
you arrange the coordination in the group and by doing that you get the same outcome without the institutional difficulties
you lose the institutional imperative
you lose the right to shape peoples work when its volunteer effort but you also shed the institutional cost which gives you greater flexibility
what flickr does is it replaces planning with coordination
and this is a general aspect of these cooperative systems
right youll have experienced this in your life whenever you bought your first mobile phone and you stopped making plans
you just said ill call you when i get there
call me when you get off work right
that is a point to point replacement of coordination with planning
right were now able to do that kind of thing with groups
to say instead of we must make an advance plan we must have a five year projection of where the wikipedia is going to be or whatever you can just say lets coordinate the group effort and lets deal with it as we go because were now well enough coordinated that we dont have to take on the problems of deciding in advance what to do
so heres another example this ones somewhat more somber
these are photos on flickr tagged iraq
and everything that was hard about the coordination cost with the mermaid parade is even harder here
there are more pictures there are more photographers
its taken over a wider geographic area
the photos are spread out over a longer period of time
and worst of all that figure at the bottom approximately ten photos per photographer is a lie
its mathematically true but it doesnt really talk about anything important because in these systems the average isnt really what matters
what matters is this
this is a graph of photographs tagged iraq as taken by the photographers who contributed the photos
and its ranked in order of number of photos taken per photographer
you can see here over at the end our most prolific photographer has taken around photos and you can see theres a few people who have taken hundreds of photos
then theres dozens of people whove taken dozens of photos
and by the time we get around here we get ten or fewer photos and then theres this long flat tail
and by the time you get to the middle youve got hundreds of people who have contributed only one photo each
this is called a power law distribution
it appears often in unconstrained social systems where people are allowed to contribute as much or as little as they like this is often what you get right
the math behind the power law distribution is that whatevers in the nth position is doing about one nth of whatevers being measured relative to the person in the first position
so wed expect the tenth most prolific photographer to have contributed about a tenth of the photos and the hundredth most prolific photographer to have contributed only about a hundred as many photos as the most prolific photographer did
so the head of the curve can be sharper or flatter
but that basic math accounts both for the steep slope and for the long flat tail
and curiously in these systems as they grow larger the systems dont converge they diverge more
in bigger systems the head gets bigger and the tail gets longer so the imbalance increases
you can see the curve is obviously heavily left weighted heres how heavily if you take the top percent of photographers contributing to this system they account for three quarters of the photos taken just the top percent most prolific photographers
if you go down to five percent youre still accounting for percent of the photos
if you go down to one percent exclude percent of the group effort youre still accounting for almost a quarter of the photos
and because of this left weighting the average is actually here way to the left
and that sounds strange to our ears but what ends up happening is that percent of the contributors have contributed a below average amount
that sounds strange because we expect average and middle to be about the same but theyre not at all
this is the math underlying the rule right
whenever you hear anybody talking about the rule this is whats going on right
percent of the merchandise accounts for percent of the revenue percent of the users use percent of the resources this is the shape people are talking about when that happens
institutions only have two tools carrots and sticks
and the percent zone is a no carrot and no stick zone
the costs of running the institution mean that you cannot take on the work of those people easily in an institutional frame
the institutional model always pushes leftwards treating these people as employees
the institutional response is i can get percent of the value for percent of the hires great thats what ill do
the cooperative infrastructure model says why do you want to give up a quarter of the value
if your system is designed so that you have to give up a quarter of the value re engineer the system
dont take on the cost that prevents you from getting to the contributions of these people
build the system so that anybody can contribute at any amount
so the coordination response asks not how are these people as employees but rather what is their contribution like right
we have over here psycho milt a flickr user who has contributed one and only one photo titled iraq
and heres the photo right labeled bad day at work
right so the question is do you want that photo yes or no
the question is not is psycho milt a good employee
and the tension here is between institution as enabler and institution as obstacle
when youre dealing with the left hand edge of one of these distributions when youre dealing with the people who spend a lot of time producing a lot of the material you want thats an institution as enabler world
you can hire those people as employees you can coordinate their work and you can get some output
but when youre down here where the psycho milts of the world are adding one photo at a time thats institution as obstacle
institutions hate being told theyre obstacles
one of the first things that happens when you institutionalize a problem is that the first goal of the institution immediately shifts from whatever the nominal goal was to self preservation
and the actual goal of the institution goes to two through n
right so when institutions are told they are obstacles and that there are other ways of coordinating the value they go through something a little bit like the kubler ross stages of reaction being told you have a fatal illness denial anger bargaining acceptance
most of the cooperative systems weve seen havent been around long enough to have gotten to the acceptance phase
many many institutions are still in denial but were seeing recently a lot of both anger and bargaining
theres a wonderful small example going on right now
in france a bus company is suing people for forming a carpool right because the fact that they have coordinated themselves to create cooperative value is depriving them of revenue
you can follow this in the guardian
its actually quite entertaining
the bigger question is what do you do about the value down here
right how do you capture that
and institutions as ive said are prevented from capturing that
steve ballmer now ceo of microsoft was criticizing linux a couple of years ago and he said oh this business of thousands of programmers contributing to linux this is a myth
weve looked at whos contributed to linux and most of the patches have been produced by programmers whove only done one thing right
you can hear this distribution under that complaint
and you can see why from ballmers point of view thats a bad idea right
we hired this programmer he came in he drank our cokes and played foosball for three years and he had one idea
right bad hire right
the psycho milt question is was it a good idea
what if it was a security patch
what if it was a security patch for a buffer overflow exploit of which windows has not some several
do you want that patch right
the fact that a single programmer can without having to move into a professional relation to an institution improve linux once and never be seen from again should terrify ballmer
because this kind of value is unreachable in classic institutional frameworks but is part of cooperative systems of open source software of file sharing of the wikipedia ive used a lot of examples from flickr but there are actually stories about this from all over
meetup a service founded so that users could find people in their local area who share their interests and affinities and actually have a real world meeting offline in a cafe or a pub or what have you
when scott heiferman founded meetup he thought it would be used for you know train spotters and cat fanciers classic affinity groups
the inventors dont know what the invention is
number one group on meetup right now most chapters in most cities with most members most active
stay at home moms right
in the suburbanized dual income united states stay at home moms are actually missing the social infrastructure that comes from extended family and local small scale neighborhoods
so theyre reinventing it using these tools
meetup is the platform but the value here is in social infrastructure
if you want to know what technology is going to change the world dont pay attention to year old boys pay attention to young mothers because they have got not an ounce of support for technology that doesnt materially make their lives better
this is so much more important than xbox but its a lot less glitzy
i think this is a revolution
i think that this is a really profound change in the way human affairs are arranged
and i use that word advisedly
its a revolution in that its a change in equilibrium
its a whole new way of doing things which includes new downsides
in the united states right now a woman named judith miller is in jail for not having given to a federal grand jury her sources shes a reporter for the new york times her sources in a very abstract and hard to follow case
and journalists are in the street rallying to improve the shield laws
the shield laws are our laws pretty much a patchwork of state laws that prevent a journalist from having to betray a source
this is happening however against the background of the rise of web logging
web logging is a classic example of mass amateurization
it has de professionalized publishing
want to publish globally anything you think today
it is a one button operation that you can do for free
that has sent the professional class of publishing down into the ranks of mass amateurization
and so the shield law as much as we want it we want a professional class of truth tellers it is becoming increasingly incoherent because the institution is becoming incoherent
there are people in the states right now tying themselves into knots trying to figure out whether or not bloggers are journalists
and the answer to that question is it doesnt matter because thats not the right question
journalism was an answer to an even more important question which is how will society be informed
how will they share ideas and opinions
and if there is an answer to that that happens outside the professional framework of journalism it makes no sense to take a professional metaphor and apply it to this distributed class
so as much as we want the shield laws the background the institution to which they were attached is becoming incoherent
heres another example
pro ana the pro ana groups
these are groups of teenage girls who have taken on web logs bulletin boards other kinds of cooperative infrastructure and have used it to set up support groups for remaining anorexic by choice
they post pictures of thin models which they call thinspiration
they have little slogans like salvation through starvation
they even have lance armstrong style bracelets these red bracelets which signify in the small group i am trying to maintain my eating disorder
they trade tips like if you feel like eating something clean a toilet or the litter box the feeling will pass
were used to support groups being beneficial
we have an attitude that support groups are inherently beneficial
but it turns out that the logic of the support group is value neutral
a support group is simply a small group that wants to maintain a way of living in the context of a larger group
now when the larger group is a bunch of drunks and the small group wants to stay sober then we think thats a great support group
but when the small group is teenage girls who want to stay anorexic by choice then were horrified
whats happened is that the normative goals of the support groups that were used to came from the institutions that were framing them and not from the infrastructure
once the infrastructure becomes generically available the logic of the support group has been revealed to be accessible to anyone including people pursuing these kinds of goals
so there are significant downsides to these changes as well as upsides and of course in the current environment one need allude only lightly to the work of non state actors trying to influence global affairs and taking advantage of these
this is a social map of the hijackers and their associates who perpetrated the attack
it was produced by analyzing their communications patterns using a lot of these tools and doubtless the intelligence communities of the world are doing the same work today for the attacks of last week
now this is the part of the talk where i tell you whats going to come as a result of all of this but im running out of time which is good because i dont know
right as with the printing press if its really a revolution it doesnt take us from point a to point b
it takes us from point a to chaos
the printing press precipitated years of chaos moving from a world where the catholic church was the sort of organizing political force to the treaty of westphalia when we finally knew what the new unit was the nation state
now im not predicting years of chaos as a result of this
years in which loosely coordinated groups are going to be given increasingly high leverage and the more those groups forego traditional institutional imperatives like deciding in advance whats going to happen or the profit motive the more leverage theyll get
and institutions are going to come under an increasing degree of pressure and the more rigidly managed and the more they rely on information monopolies the greater the pressure is going to be
and thats going to happen one arena at a time one institution at a time the forces are general but the results are going to be specific
and so the point here is not this is wonderful or were going to see a transition from only institutions to only cooperative framework
its going to be much more complicated than that
but the point is that its going to be a massive readjustment
and since we can see it in advance and know its coming my argument is essentially we might as well get good at it
thank you very much

title nic marks the happy planet index title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript statistician nic marks asks why we measure a nations success by its productivity instead of by the happiness and well being of its people he introduces the happy planet index which tracks national well being against resource use which countries rank highest in the hpi you might be surprised description
martin luther king did not say i have a nightmare when he inspired the civil rights movements
he said i have a dream
and i have a dream
i have a dream that we can stop thinking that the future will be a nightmare and this is going to be a challenge because if you think of every major blockbusting film of recent times nearly all of its visions for humanity are apocalyptic
i think this film is one of the hardest watches of modern times the road
its a beautiful piece of filmmaking but everything is desolate everything is dead
and just a father and son trying to survive walking along the road
and i think the environmental movement of which i am a part of has been complicit in creating this vision of the future
for too long we have peddled a nightmarish vision of whats going to happen
we have focused on the worst case scenario
we have focused on the problems
and we have not thought enough about the solutions
weve used fear if you like to grab peoples attention
and any psychologist will tell you that fear in the organism is linked to flight mechanism
its part of the fight and flight mechanism that when an animal is frightened think of a deer
a deer freezes very very still poised to run away
and i think thats what were doing when were asking people to engage with our agenda around environmental degradation and climate change
people are freezing and running away because were using fear
and i think the environmental movement has to grow up and start to think about what progress is
what would it be like to be improving the human lot
and one of the problems that we face i think is that the only people that have cornered the market in terms of progress is a financial definition of what progress is an economic definition of what progress is that somehow if we get the right numbers to go up were going to be better off whether thats on the stock market whether thats with gdp and economic growth that somehow life is going to get better
this is somehow appealing to human greed instead of fear that more is better
come on in the western world we have enough
maybe some parts of the world dont but we have enough
and weve know for a long time that this is not a good measure of the welfare of nations
in fact the architect of our national accounting system simon kuznets in the said that a nations welfare can scarcely be inferred from their national income
but weve created a national accounting system which is firmly based on production and producing stuff
and indeed this is probably historical and it had its time
in the second world war we needed to produce a lot of stuff
and indeed we were so successful at producing certain types of stuff that we destroyed a lot of europe and we had to rebuild it afterwards
and so our national accounting system became fixated on what we can produce
but as early as this visionary man robert kennedy at the start of his ill fated presidential campaign gave the most eloquent deconstruction of gross national product that ever has been
and he finished his talk with the phrase that the gross national product measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile
how crazy is that that our measure of progress our dominant measure of progress in society is measuring everything except that which makes life worthwhile
i believe if kennedy was alive today he would be asking statisticians such as myself to go out and find out what makes life worthwhile
hed be asking us to redesign our national accounting system to be based upon such important things as social justice sustainability and peoples well being
and actually social scientists have already gone out and asked these questions around the world
this is from a global survey
its asking people what do they want
and unsurprisingly people all around the world say that what they want is happiness for themselves for their families their children their communities
okay they think money is slightly important
its there but its not nearly as important as happiness and its not nearly as important as love
we all need to love and be loved in life
its not nearly as important as health
we want to be healthy and live a full life
these seem to be natural human aspirations
why are statisticians not measuring these
why are we not thinking of the progress of nations in these terms instead of just how much stuff we have
and really this is what ive done with my adult life is think about how do we measure happiness how do we measure well being how can we do that within environmental limits
and we created at the organization that i work for the new economics foundation something we call the happy planet index because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy
why dont we create a measure of progress that shows that
and what we do is we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation is how successful is it at creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens
that should be the goal of every nation on the planet
but we have to remember that theres a fundamental input to that and that is how many of the planets resources we use
we all have one planet we all have to share it
it is the ultimate scarce resource the one planet that we share
and economics is very interested in scarcity
when it has a scarce resource that it wants to turn into a desirable outcome it thinks in terms of efficiency
it thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck
and this is a measure of how much well being we get for our planetary resource use
it is an efficiency measure
and probably the easiest way to show you that is to show you this graph
running horizontally along the graph is ecological footprint which is a measure of how much resources we use and how much pressure we put on the planet
more is bad
running vertically upwards is a measure called happy life years
its about the well being of nations
its like a happiness adjusted life expectancy
its like quality and quantity of life in nations
and the yellow dot there you see is the global average
now theres a huge array of nations around that global average
to the top right of the graph are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well being but theyre using a lot of planet to get there
they are the u s a other western countries going across in those triangles and a few gulf states in there actually
conversely at the bottom left of the graph are countries that are not producing much well being typically sub saharan africa
in hobbesian terms life is short and brutish there
the average life expectancy in many of these countries is only years
malaria hiv aids are killing a lot of people in these regions of the world
but now for the good news
there are some countries up there yellow triangles that are doing better than global average that are heading up towards the top left of the graph
this is an aspirational graph
we want to be top left where good lives dont cost the earth
theyre latin american
the country on its own up at the top is a place i havent been to
maybe some of you have
costa rica
costa rica average life expectancy is and a half years
that is longer than in the usa
they are according to the latest gallup world poll the happiest nation on the planet than anybody more than switzerland and denmark
they are the happiest place
they are doing that on a quarter of the resources that are used typically in western world a quarter of the resources
whats going on there
whats happening in costa rica
we can look at some of the data
percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources
their government is one of the first to commit to be carbon neutral by
they abolished the army in
and they invested in social programs health and education
they have one of the highest literacy rates in latin america and in the world
and they have that latin vibe dont they
they have the social connectedness
the challenge is that possibly and the thing we might have to think about is that the future might not be north american might not be western european
it might be latin american
and the challenge really is to pull the global average up here
thats what we need to do
and if were going to do that we need to pull countries from the bottom and we need to pull countries from the right of the graph
and then were starting to create a happy planet
thats one way of looking at it
another way of looking at it is looking at time trends
we dont have good data going back for every country in the world but for some of the richest countries the oecd group we do
and this is the trend in well being over that time a small increase but this is the trend in ecological footprint
and so in strict happy planet methodology weve become less efficient at turning our ultimate scarce resource into the outcome we want to
and the point really is is that i think probably everybody in this room would like society to get to without an apocalyptic something happening
its actually not very long away
its half a human lifetime away
a child entering school today will be my age in
this is not the very distant future
this is what the u k government target on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like
and i put it to you that is not business as usual
that is changing our business
that is changing the way we create our organizations we do our government policy and we live our lives
and the point is we need to carry on increasing well being
no one can go to the polls and say that quality of life is going to reduce
none of us i think want human progress to stop
i think we want it to carry on
i think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing
and i think this is where climate change skeptics and deniers come in
i think this is what they want they want quality of life to keep increasing
they want to hold on to what theyve got
and if were going to engage them i think thats what weve got to do
and that means we have to really increase efficiency even more
now thats all very easy to draw graphs and things like that but the point is we need to turn those curves
and this is where i think we can take a leaf out of systems theory systems engineers where they create feedback loops put the right information at the right point of time
human beings are very motivated by the now
you put a smart meter in your home and you see how much electricity youre using right now how much its costing you your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly
what would that look like for society
why is it on the radio news every evening i hear the ftse the dow jones the dollar pound ratio i dont even know which way the dollar pound ratio should go to be good news
and why do i hear that
why dont i hear how much energy britain used yesterday or american used yesterday
did we meet our three percent annual target on reducing carbon emissions
thats how you create a collective goal
you put it out there into the media and start thinking about it
and we need positive feedback loops for increasing well being at a government level they might create national accounts of well being
at a business level you might look at the well being of your employees which we know is really linked to creativity which is linked to innovation and were going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues
at a personal level we need these nudges too
maybe we dont quite need the data but we need reminders
in the u k we have a strong public health message on five fruit and vegetables a day and how much exercise we should do never my best thing
what are these for happiness
what are the five things that you should do every day to be happier
we did a project for the government office of science a couple of years ago a big program called the foresight program lots and lots of people involved lots of experts everything evidence based a huge tome
but a piece of work we did was on what five positive actions can you do to improve well being in your life
and the point of these is they are not quite the secrets of happiness but they are things that i think happiness will flow out the side from
and the first of these is to connect is that your social relationships are the most important cornerstones of your life
do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do and energy
keep building them
the second one is be active
the fastest way out of a bad mood step outside go for a walk turn the radio on and dance
being active is great for our positive mood
the third one is take notice
how aware are you of things going on around the world the seasons changing people around you
do you notice whats bubbling up for you and trying to emerge
based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness cognitive behavioral therapy strong for our well being
the fourth is keep learning and keep is important learning throughout the whole life course
older people who keep learning and are curious they have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down
but it doesnt have to be formal learning its not knowledge based
its more curiosity
it can be learning to cook a new dish picking up an instrument you forgot as a child
keep learning
and the final one is that most anti economic of activities but give
our generosity our altruism our compassion are all hardwired to the reward mechanism in our brain
we feel good if we give
you can do an experiment where you give two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning
you tell one of them to spend it on themselves and one on other people
you measure their happiness at the end of the day those that have gone and spent on other people are much happier that those that spent it on themselves
and these five ways which we put onto these handy postcards i would say dont have to cost the earth
they dont have any carbon content
they dont need a lot of material goods to be satisfied
and so i think its really quite feasible that happiness does not cost the earth
now martin luther king on the eve of his death gave an incredible speech
he said i know there are challenges ahead there may be trouble ahead but i fear no one i dont care
i have been to the mountain top and i have seen the promised land
now he was a preacher but i believe the environmental movement and in fact the business community government needs to go to the top of the mountain top and it needs to look out and it needs to see the promised land or the land of promise and it needs to have a vision of a world that we all want
and not only that we need to create a great transition to get there and we need to pave that great transition with good things
human beings want to be happy
pave them with the five ways
and we need to have signposts gathering people together and pointing them something like the happy planet index
and then i believe that we can all create a world we all want where happiness does not cost the earth

title shirin neshat art in exile title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript iranian born artist shirin neshat explores the paradox of being an artist in exile a voice for her people but unable to go home in her work she explores iran pre and post islamic revolution tracing political and societal change through powerful images of women description
the story i wanted to share with you today is my challenge as an iranian artist as an iranian woman artist as an iranian woman artist living in exile
well it has its pluses and minuses
on the dark side politics doesnt seem to escape people like me
every iranian artist in one form or another is political
politics have defined our lives
if youre living in iran youre facing censorship harassment arrest torture at times execution
if youre living outside like me youre faced with life in exile the pain of the longing and the separation from your loved ones and your family
therefore we dont find the moral emotional psychological and political space to distance ourselves from the reality of social responsibility
oddly enough an artist such as myself finds herself also in the position of being the voice the speaker of my people even if i have indeed no access to my own country
also people like myself were fighting two battles on different grounds
were being critical of the west the perception of the west about our identity about the image that is constructed about us about our women about our politics about our religion
we are there to take pride and insist on respect
and at the same time were fighting another battle
that is our regime our government our atrocious government has done every crime in order to stay in power
our artists are at risk
we are in a position of danger
we pose a threat to the order of the government
but ironically this situation has empowered all of us because we are considered as artists central to the cultural political social discourse in iran
we are there to inspire to provoke to mobilize to bring hope to our people
we are the reporters of our people and are communicators to the outside world
art is our weapon
culture is a form of resistance
i envy sometimes the artists of the west for their freedom of expression
for the fact that they can distance themselves from the question of politics
from the fact that they are only serving one audience mainly the western culture
but also i worry about the west because often in this country in this western world that we have culture risks being a form of entertainment
our people depend on our artists and culture is beyond communication
my journey as an artist started from a very very personal place
i did not start to make social commentary about my country
the first one that you see in front of you is actually when i first returned to iran after being separated for a good years
it was after the islamic revolution of
while i was absent from iran the islamic revolution had descended on iran and had entirely transformed the country from persian to the islamic culture
i came mainly to be reunited with my family and to reconnect in a way that i found my place in the society
but instead i found a country that was totally ideological and that i didnt recognize anymore
more so i became very interested as i was facing my own personal dilemmas and questions i became immersed in the study of the islamic revolution how indeed it had incredibly transformed the lives of iranian women
i found the subject of iranian women immensely interesting in the way the women of iran historically seemed to embody the political transformation
so in a way by studying a woman you can read the structure and the ideology of the country
so i made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse the subject of martyrdom the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection of love of god faith but violence and crime and cruelty
for me this became incredibly important
and yet i had an unusual position toward this
i was an outsider who had come back to iran to find my place but i was not in a position to be critical of the government or the ideology of the islamic revolution
this changed slowly as i found my voice and i discovered things that i didnt know i would discover
so my art became slightly more critical
my knife became a little sharper
and i fell into a life in exile
i am a nomadic artist
i work in morocco in turkey in mexico
i go everywhere to make believe its iran
now i am making films
last year i finished a film called women without men
women without men returns to history but another part of our iranian history
it goes to when american cia exercised a coup and removed a democratically elected leader dr mossadegh
the book is written by an iranian woman shahrnush parsipur
its a magical realist novel
this book is banned and she spent five years in prison
my obsession with this book and the reason i made this into a film is because it at once was addressing the question of being a female traditionally historically in iran and the question of four women who are all looking for an idea of change freedom and democracy while the country of iran equally as if another character also struggled for an idea of freedom and democracy and independence from the foreign interventions
i made this film because i felt its important for it to speak to the westerners about our history as a country
that all of you seem to remember iran after the islamic revolution
that iran was once a secular society and we had democracy and this democracy was stolen from us by the american government by the british government
this film also speaks to the iranian people in asking them to return to their history and look at themselves before they were so islamicized in the way we looked in the way we played music in the way we had intellectual life
and most of all in the way that we fought for democracy
these are some of the shots actually from my film
these are some of the images of the coup
and we made this film in casablanca recreating all the shots
this film tried to find a balance between telling a political story but also a feminine story
being a visual artist indeed i am foremost interested to make art to make art that transcends politics religion the question of feminism and become an important timeless universal work of art
the challenge i have is how to do that
how to tell a political story but an allegorical story
how to move you with your emotions but also make your mind work
these are some of the images and the characters of the film
now comes the green movement the summer of as my film is released the uprising begins in the streets of tehran
what is unbelievably ironic is the period that we tried to depict in the film the cry for democracy and social justice repeats itself now again in tehran
the green movement significantly inspired the world
it brought a lot of attention to all those iranians who stand for basic human rights and struggle for democracy
what was most significant for me was once again the presence of the women
theyre absolutely inspirational for me
if in the islamic revolution the images of the woman portrayed were submissive and didnt have a voice now we saw a new idea of feminism in the streets of tehran women who were educated forward thinking non traditional sexually open fearless and seriously feminist
these women and those young men united iranians across the world inside and outside
i then discovered why i take so much inspiration from iranian women
that under all circumstances they have pushed the boundary
they have confronted the authority
they have broken every rule in the smallest and the biggest way
and once again they proved themselves
i stand here to say that iranian women have found a new voice and their voice is giving me my voice
and its a great honor to be an iranian woman and an iranian artist even if i have to operate in the west only for now
thank you so much

title wingham rowan a new kind of job market title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript plenty of people need jobs with very flexible hours but its difficult for those people to connect with the employers who need them wingham rowan is working on that he explains how the same technology that powers modern financial markets can help employers book workers for slivers of time description
this is about a hidden corner of the labor market
its the world of people who need to work ultra flexibly if theyre to work at all
so think for instance of someone who has a recurring but unpredictable medical condition or somebody whos caring for a dependent adult or a parent with complex child care needs
their availability for work can be such that its a few hours today
maybe i can work tomorrow but i dont know if and when yet
and its extraordinarily difficult for these people to find the work that they so often need very badly
which is a tragedy because there are employers who can use pools of very flexible local people booked completely ad hoc around when that person wants to work
imagine that you run a cafe
its mid morning the place is filling up
youre going to have a busy lunchtime rush
if you could get two extra workers for minutes to start in an hours time youd do it but theyd have to be reliable inducted in how your cafe works
theyd have to be available at very competitive rates
theyd have to be bookable in about the next minute
in reality no recruitment agency wants to handle that sort of business so you are going to muddle by understaffed
and its not just caterers its hoteliers its retailers its anyone who provides services to the public or businesses
theres all sorts of organizations that can use these pools of very flexible people possibly already once theyve been inducted
at this level of the labor market what you need is a marketplace for spare hours
they do exist heres how they work
so in this example a distribution company has said weve got a rush order that weve got to get out of the warehouse tomorrow morning
show us everyone whos available
its found workers
everybody on this screen is genuinely available at those specific hours tomorrow
theyre all contactable in time for this booking
theyve all defined the terms on which they will accept bookings
and this booking is within all the parameters for each individual
and they would all be legally compliant by doing this booking
of course theyre all trained to work in warehouses
you can select as many of them as you want
theyre from multiple agencies
its calculated the charge rate for each person for this specific booking
and its monitoring their reliability
the people on the top row are the provenly reliable ones
theyre likely to be more expensive
in an alternative view of this pool of local very flexible people heres a market research company and its inducted maybe local people in how to do street interviewing
and theyve got a new campaign they want to run it next week
and theyre looking at how many of the people theyve inducted are available each hour next week
and theyll then decide when to do their street interviews
but is there more that could be done for this corner of the labor market
because right now there are so many people who need whatever economic opportunity they can get
lets make it personal
imagine that a young woman base of the economic pyramid very little prospect of getting a job what economic activity could she theoretically engage in
well she might be willing to work odd hours in a call center in a reception area in a mail room
she may be interested in providing local services to her community babysitting local deliveries pet care
she may have possessions that she would like to trade at times she doesnt need them
so she might have a sofa bed in her front room that she would like to let out
she might have a bike a video games console she only uses occasionally
and youre probably thinking because youre all very web aware yes and were in the era of collaborative consumption so she can go online and do all this
she can go to airbnb to list her sofa bed she can go to taskrabbit com and say i want to do local deliveries and so on
these are good sites but i believe we can go a step further
and the key to that is a philosophy that we call modern markets for all
markets have changed beyond recognition in the last years but only for organizations at the top of the economy
if youre a wall street trader you now take it for granted that you sell your financial assets in a system of markets that identifies the most profitable opportunities for you in real time executes on that in microseconds within the boundaries youve set
it analyzes supply and demand and pricing and tells you where your next wave of opportunities are coming from
it manages counterparty risk in incredibly sophisticated ways
its all extremely low overhead
what have we gained at the bottom of the economy in terms of markets in the last years
basically classified adverts with a search facility
so why do we have this disparity between these incredibly sophisticated markets at the top of the economy that are increasingly sucking more and more activity and resource out of the main economy into this rarefied level of trading and what the rest of us have
a modern market is more than a website its a web of interoperable marketplaces back office mechanisms regulatory regimes settlement mechanisms liquidity sources and so on
and when a wall street trader comes into work in the morning she does not write a listing for every financial derivative she wants to sell today and then post that listing on multiple websites and wait for potential buyers to get in touch and start negotiating the terms on which she might trade
in the early days of this modern markets technology the financial institutions worked out how they could leverage their buying power their back office processes their relationships their networks to shape these new markets that would create all this new activity
they asked governments for supporting regulatory regimes and in a lot of cases they got it
but throughout the economy there are facilities that could likewise leverage a new generation of markets for the benefit of all of us
and those facilities im talking about things like the mechanisms that prove our identity the licensing authorities that know what each of us is allowed to do legally at any given time the processes by which we resolve disputes through official channels
these mechanisms these facilities are not in the gift of craigslist or gumtree or yahoo theyre controlled by the state
and the policymakers who sit on top of them are i suggest simply not thinking about how those facilities could be used to underpin a whole new era of markets
like everyone else those policymakers are taking it for granted that modern markets are the preserve of organizations powerful enough to create them for themselves
suppose we stopped taking that for granted
suppose tomorrow morning the prime minister of britain or the president of the u s or the leader of any other developed nation woke up and said im never going to be able to create all the jobs i need in the current climate
i have got to focus on whatever economic opportunity i can get to my citizens
and for that they have to be able to access state of the art markets
how do i make that happen
and i think i can see a few eyes rolling
politicians in a big complex sophisticated i t project
oh thats going to be a disaster waiting to happen
not necessarily
there is a precedent for technology enabled service that has been initiated by politicians in multiple countries and has been hugely successful national lotteries
lets take britain as an example
our government didnt design the national lottery it didnt fund the national lottery it doesnt operate the national lottery
it simply passed the national lottery act and this is what followed
this act defines what a national lottery will look like
it specifies certain benefits that the state can uniquely bestow on the operators
and it puts some obligations on those operators
in terms of spreading gambling activity to the masses this was an unqualified success
but lets suppose that our aim is to bring new economic activity to the base of the pyramid
could we use the same model
i believe we could
so imagine that policymakers outlined a facility
lets call it national e markets nems for short
think of it as a regulated public utility
so its on a par with the water supply or the road network
and its a series of markets for low level trade that can be fulfilled by a person or a small company
and government has certain benefits it can uniquely bestow on these markets
its about public spending going through these markets to buy public services at the local level
its about interfacing these markets direct into the highest official channels in the land
its about enshrining governments role as a publicist for these markets
its about deregulating some sectors so that local people can enter them
so taxi journeys might be one example
and there are certain obligations that should go with those benefits to be placed on the operators and the key one is of course that the operators pay for everything including all the interfacing into the public sector
so imagine that the operators make their return by building a percentage markup into each transaction
imagine that theres a concession period defined of maybe years in which they can take all these benefits and run with them
and imagine that the consortia who bid to run it are told whoever comes in at the lowest percentage markup on each transaction to fund the whole thing will get the deal
so government then exits the frame
this is now in the hands of the consortium
either they are going to unlock an awful lot of economic opportunity and make a percentage on all of it or its all going to crash and burn which is tough on their shareholders
it doesnt bother the taxpayer necessarily
and there would be no constraints on alternative markets
so this would just be one more choice among millions of internet forums
but it could be very different because having access to those state backed facilities could incentivize this consortium to seriously invest in the service
because they would have to get a lot of these small transactions going to start making their return
so were talking about sectors like home hair care the hire of toys farm work hire of clothes even meals delivered to your door services for tourists home care
this would be a world of very small trades but very well informed because national e markets will deliver data
so this is a local person potentially deciding whether to enter the babysitting market
and they might be aware that they would have to fund vetting and training if they wanted to go into that market
theyd have to do assessment interviews with local parents who wanted a pool of babysitters
is it worth their while
should they be looking at other sectors
should they be moving to another part of the country where theres a shortage of babysitters
this kind of data can become routine
and this data can be used by investors
so if theres a problem with a shortage of babysitters in some parts of the country and the problem is nobody can afford the vetting and training an investor can pay for it and the system will tithe back the enhanced earnings of the individuals for maybe the next two years
this is a world of atomized capitalism
so its small trades by small people but its very informed safe convenient low overhead and immediate
some rough research suggests this could unlock around million pounds worth a day of new economic activity in a country the size of the u k
does that sound improbable to you
thats what a lot of people said about turbo trading in financial exchanges years ago
do not underestimate the transformative power of truly modern markets
thank you

title martin seligman the new era of positive psychology title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript martin seligman talks about psychology as a field of study and as it works one on one with each patient and each practitioner as it moves beyond a focus on disease what can modern psychology help us to become description
when i was president of the american psychological association they tried to media train me and an encounter i had with cnn summarizes what im going to be talking about today which is the eleventh reason to be optimistic
the editor of discover told us of them im going to give you the eleventh
so they came to me cnn and they said professor seligman would you tell us about the state of psychology today
wed like to interview you about that and i said great
and she said but this is cnn so you only get a sound bite
so i said well how many words do i get
and she said well one
and cameras rolled and she said professor seligman what is the state of psychology today
good
cut cut that wont do
wed really better give you a longer sound bite
well how many words do i get this time i think well you get two
doctor seligman what is the state of psychology today
not good
look doctor seligman we can see youre really not comfortable in this medium
wed better give you a real sound bite
this time you can have three words
professor seligman what is the state of psychology today
not good enough and thats what im going to be talking about
i want to say why psychology was good why it was not good and how it may become in the next years good enough
and by parallel summary i want to say the same thing about technology about entertainment and design because i think the issues are very similar
so why was psychology good
well for more than years psychology worked within the disease model
ten years ago when i was on an airplane and i introduced myself to my seatmate and told them what i did theyd move away from me
and because quite rightly they were saying psychology is about finding whats wrong with you spot the loony
and now when i tell people what i do they move toward me
and what was good about psychology about the billion dollar investment nimh made about working in the disease model about what you mean by psychology is that years ago none of the disorders were treatable it was entirely smoke and mirrors
and now of the disorders are treatable two of them actually curable
and the other thing that happened is that a science developed a science of mental illness
that we found out that we could take fuzzy concepts like depression alcoholism and measure them with rigor
that we could create a classification of the mental illnesses
that we could understand the causality of the mental illnesses
we could look across time at the same people people for example who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia and ask what the contribution of mothering of genetics are and we could isolate third variables by doing experiments on the mental illnesses
and best of all we were able in the last years to invent drug treatments and psychological treatments
and then we were able to test them rigorously in random assignment placebo controlled designs throw out the things that didnt work keep the things that actively did
and the conclusion of that is that psychology and psychiatry over the last years can actually claim that we can make miserable people less miserable
and i think thats terrific im proud of it
but what was not good the consequences of that were three things
the first was moral that psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists pathologizers that our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble bricks fell on you
and we forgot that people made choices and decisions
we forgot responsibility that was the first cost
the second cost was that we forgot about you people
we forgot about improving normal lives
we forgot about a mission to make relatively untroubled people happier more fulfilled more productive and genius high talent became a dirty word
no one works on that
and the third problem about the disease model is in our rush to do something about people in trouble in our rush to do something about repairing damage it never occurred to us to develop interventions to make people happier positive interventions
so that was not good
and so thats what led people like nancy etcoff dan gilbert mike csikszentmihalyi and myself to work in something i call positive psychology which has three aims
the first is that psychology should be just as concerned with human strength as it is with weakness
it should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage
it should be interested in the best things in life
and it should be just as concerned with making the lives of normal people fulfilling and with genius with nurturing high talent
so in the last years and the hope for the future weve seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology a science of what makes life worth living
it turns out that we can measure different forms of happiness
and any of you for free can go to that website and take the entire panoply of tests of happiness
you can ask how do you stack up for positive emotion for meaning for flow against literally tens of thousands of other people
we created the opposite of the diagnostic manual of the insanities a classification of the strengths and virtues that looks at the sex ratio how theyre defined how to diagnose them what builds them and what gets in their way
we found that we could discover the causation of the positive states the relationship between left hemispheric activity and right hemispheric activity as a cause of happiness
ive spent my life working on extremely miserable people and ive asked the question how do extremely miserable people differ from the rest of you
and starting about six years ago we asked about extremely happy people
and how do they differ from the rest of us
and it turns out theres one way
theyre not more religious theyre not in better shape they dont have more money theyre not better looking they dont have more good events and fewer bad events
the one way in which they differ theyre extremely social
they dont sit in seminars on saturday morning
they dont spend time alone
each of them is in a romantic relationship and each has a rich repertoire of friends
but watch out here this is merely correlational data not causal and its about happiness in the first hollywood sense im going to talk about happiness of ebullience and giggling and good cheer
and im going to suggest to you thats not nearly enough in just a moment
we found we could begin to look at interventions over the centuries from the buddha to tony robbins
about interventions have been proposed that allegedly make people happy
and we find that weve been able to manualize many of them and we actually carry out random assignment efficacy and effectiveness studies
that is which ones actually make people lastingly happier
in a couple of minutes ill tell you about some of those results
but the upshot of this is that the mission i want psychology to have in addition to its mission of curing the mentally ill and in addition to its mission of making miserable people less miserable is can psychology actually make people happier
and to ask that question happy is not a word i use very much weve had to break it down into what i think is askable about happy
and i believe there are three different and i call them different because different interventions build them its possible to have one rather than the other three different happy lives
the first happy life is the pleasant life
this is a life in which you have as much positive emotion as you possibly can and the skills to amplify it
the second is a life of engagement a life in your work your parenting your love your leisure time stops for you
thats what aristotle was talking about
and third the meaningful life
so i want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them
the first life is the pleasant life and its simply as best we can find it its having as many of the pleasures as you can as much positive emotion as you can and learning the skills savoring mindfulness that amplify them that stretch them over time and space
but the pleasant life has three drawbacks and its why positive psychology is not happy ology and why it doesnt end here
the first drawback is that it turns out the pleasant life your experience of positive emotion is heritable about percent heritable and in fact not very modifiable
so the different tricks that matthieu and i and others know about increasing the amount of positive emotion in your life are to percent tricks getting more of it
second is that positive emotion habituates it habituates rapidly indeed
its all like french vanilla ice cream the first taste is a percent by the time youre down to the sixth taste its gone
and as i said its not particularly malleable
and this leads to the second life
and i have to tell you about my friend len to talk about why positive psychology is more than positive emotion more than building pleasure
in two of the three great arenas of life by the time len was len was enormously successful the first arena was work
by the time he was he was an options trader
by the time he was he was a multimillionaire and the head of an options trading company
second in play hes a national champion bridge player
but in the third great arena of life love len is an abysmal failure
and the reason he was was that len is a cold fish
len is an introvert
american women said to len when he dated them youre no fun you dont have positive emotion get lost
and len was wealthy enough to be able to afford a park avenue psychoanalyst who for five years tried to find the sexual trauma that had somehow locked positive emotion inside of him
but it turned out there wasnt any sexual trauma
it turned out that len grew up in long island and he played football and watched football and played bridge len is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities
the question is is len unhappy and i want to say not
contrary to what psychology told us about the bottom percent of the human race in positive affectivity i think len is one of the happiest people i know
hes not consigned to the hell of unhappiness and thats because len like most of you is enormously capable of flow
when he walks onto the floor of the american exchange at in the morning time stops for him and it stops till the closing bell
when the first card is played until days later the tournament is over time stops for len
and this is indeed what mike csikszentmihalyi has been talking about about flow and its distinct from pleasure in a very important way
pleasure has raw feels you know its happening its thought and feeling
but what mike told you yesterday during flow you cant feel anything
youre one with the music time stops
you have intense concentration
and this is indeed the characteristic of what we think of as the good life
and we think theres a recipe for it and its knowing what your highest strengths are
and again theres a valid test of what your five highest strengths are
and then re crafting your life to use them as much as you possibly can
re crafting your work your love your play your friendship your parenting
just one example one person i worked with was a bagger at genuardis
hated the job
shes working her way through college
her highest strength was social intelligence so she re crafted bagging to make the encounter with her the social highlight of every customers day
now obviously she failed
but what she did was to take her highest strengths and re craft work to use them as much as possible
what you get out of that is not smiley ness
you dont look like debbie reynolds
you dont giggle a lot what you get is more absorption
so thats the second path the first path positive emotion
the second path is eudaimonian flow
and the third path is meaning
this is the most venerable of the happinesses traditionally
and meaning in this view consists of very parallel to eudaimonia it consists of knowing what your highest strengths are and using them to belong to and in the service of something larger than you are
i mentioned that for all three kinds of lives the pleasant life the good life the meaningful life people are now hard at work on the question are there things that lastingly change those lives
and the answer seems to be yes and ill just give you some samples of it
its being done in a rigorous manner
its being done in the same way that we test drugs to see what really works
so we do random assignment placebo controlled long term studies of different interventions
and just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect when we teach people about the pleasant life how to have more pleasure in your life one of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills the savoring skills and youre assigned to design a beautiful day
next saturday set a day aside design yourself a beautiful day and use savoring and mindfulness to enhance those pleasures
and we can show in that way that the pleasant life is enhanced
gratitude visit i want you all to do this with me now if you would
close your eyes
id like you to remember someone who did something enormously important that changed your life in a good direction and who you never properly thanked
the person has to be alive ok
now ok you can open your eyes
i hope all of you have such a person
your assignment when youre learning the gratitude visit is to write a word testimonial to that person call them on the phone in phoenix ask if you can visit dont tell them why show up at their door you read the testimonial everyone weeps when this happens
and what happens is when we test people one week later a month later three months later theyre both happier and less depressed
another example is a strength date in which we get couples to identify their highest strengths on the strengths test and then to design an evening in which they both use their strengths and we find this is a strengthener of relationships
and fun versus philanthropy
but its so heartening to be in a group like this in which so many of you have turned your lives to philanthropy
well my undergraduates and the people i work with havent discovered this so we actually have people do something altruistic and do something fun and to contrast it
and what you find is when you do something fun it has a square wave walk set
when you do something philanthropic to help another person it lasts and it lasts
so those are examples of positive interventions
so the next to last thing i want to say is were interested in how much life satisfaction people have
and this is really what youre about and thats our target variable
and we ask the question as a function of the three different lives how much life satisfaction do you get
so we ask and weve done this in replications involving thousands of people to what extent does the pursuit of pleasure the pursuit of positive emotion the pleasant life the pursuit of engagement time stopping for you and the pursuit of meaning contribute to life satisfaction
and our results surprised us but they were backward of what we thought
it turns out the pursuit of pleasure has almost no contribution to life satisfaction
the pursuit of meaning is the strongest
the pursuit of engagement is also very strong
where pleasure matters is if you have both engagement and you have meaning then pleasures the whipped cream and the cherry
which is to say the full life the sum is greater than the parts if youve got all three
conversely if you have none of the three the empty life the sum is less than the parts
and what were asking now is does the very same relationship physical health morbidity how long you live and productivity follow the same relationship
that is in a corporation is productivity a function of positive emotion engagement and meaning
is health a function of positive engagement of pleasure and of meaning in life
and there is reason to think the answer to both of those may well be yes
so chris said that the last speaker had a chance to try to integrate what he heard and so this was amazing for me ive never been in a gathering like this
ive never seen speakers stretch beyond themselves so much which was one of the remarkable things
but i found that the problems of psychology seemed to be parallel to the problems of technology entertainment and design in the following way
we all know that technology entertainment and design have been and can be used for destructive purposes
we also know that technology entertainment and design can be used to relieve misery
and by the way the distinction between relieving misery and building happiness is extremely important
i thought when i first became a therapist years ago that if i was good enough to make someone not depressed not anxious not angry that id make them happy
and i never found that i found the best you could ever do was to get to zero
but they were empty
and it turns out the skills of happiness the skills of the pleasant life the skills of engagement the skills of meaning are different from the skills of relieving misery
and so the parallel thing holds with technology entertainment and design i believe
that is it is possible for these three drivers of our world to increase happiness to increase positive emotion and thats typically how theyve been used
but once you fractionate happiness the way i do not just positive emotion thats not nearly enough theres flow in life and theres meaning in life
as laura lee told us design and i believe entertainment and technology can be used to increase meaning engagement in life as well
so in conclusion the eleventh reason for optimism in addition to the space elevator is that i think with technology entertainment and design we can actually increase the amount of tonnage of human happiness on the planet
and if technology can in the next decade or two increase the pleasant life the good life and the meaningful life it will be good enough
if entertainment can be diverted to also increase positive emotion meaning eudaimonia it will be good enough
and if design can increase positive emotion eudaimonia and flow and meaning what were all doing together will become good enough thank you

title annmarie thomas hands on science with squishy circuits title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript in a zippy demo at ted u annmarie thomas shows how two different kinds of homemade play dough can be used to demonstrate electrical properties by lighting up leds spinning motors and turning little kids into circuit designers description
im a huge believer in hands on education
but you have to have the right tools
if im going to teach my daughter about electronics im not going to give her a soldering iron
and similarly she finds prototyping boards really frustrating for her little hands
so my wonderful student sam and i decided to look at the most tangible thing we could think of play doh
and so we spent a summer looking at different play doh recipes
and these recipes probably look really familiar to any of you who have made homemade play dough pretty standard ingredients you probably have in your kitchen
we have two favorite recipes one that has these ingredients and a second that had sugar instead of salt
and theyre great we can make great little sculptures with these
but the really cool thing about them is when we put them together
you see that really salty play doh
well it conducts electricity
and this is nothing new
it turns out that regular play doh that you buy at the store conducts electricity and high school physics teachers have used that for years
but our homemade play dough actually has half the resistance of commercial play doh
and that sugar dough
well its times more resistant to electric current than that salt dough
so what does that mean
well it means if you them together you suddenly have circuits circuits that the most creative tiny little hands can build on their own
and so i want to do a little demo for you
so if i take this salt dough again its like the play dough you probably made as kids and i plug it in its a two lead battery pack simple battery pack you can buy them at radio shack and pretty much anywhere else we can actually then light things up
but if any of you have studied electrical engineering we can also create a short circuit
if i push these together the light turns off
right the current wants to run through the play dough not through that led
if i separate them again i have some light
well now if i take that sugar dough the sugar dough doesnt want to conduct electricity
its like a wall to the electricity
if i place that between now all the dough is touching but if i stick that light back in i have light
in fact i could even add some movement to my sculptures
if i want a spinning tail lets grab a motor put some play dough on it stick it on and we have spinning
and once you have the basics we can make a slightly more complicated circuit
we call this our sushi circuit its very popular with kids
i plug in again the power to it
and now i can start talking about parallel and series circuits
i can start plugging in lots of lights
and we can start talking about things like electrical load
what happens if i put in lots of lights and then add a motor
itll dim
we can even add microprocessors and have this as an input and create squishy sound music that weve done
you could do parallel and series circuits for kids using this
so this is all in your home kitchen
weve actually tried to turn it into an electrical engineering lab
we have a website its all there these are the home recipes
weve got some videos you can make them yourselves
and its been really fun since we put them up to see where these have gone
weve had a mom in utah who used them with her kids to a science researcher in the u k and curriculum developers in hawaii
so i would encourage you all to grab some play doh grab some salt grab some sugar and start playing
we dont usually think of our kitchen as an electrical engineering lab or little kids as circuit designers but maybe we should
have fun thank you

title billy graham on technology and faith title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript speaking at ted in rev billy graham marvels at technologys power to improve lives and change the world but says the end of evil suffering and death will come only after the world accepts christ a legendary talk from teds archives description
as a clergyman you can imagine how out of place i feel
i feel like a fish out of water or maybe an owl out of the air
i was preaching in san jose some time ago and my friend mark kvamme who helped introduce me to this conference brought several ceos and leaders of some of the companies here in the silicon valley to have breakfast with me or i with them
and i was so stimulated
and had such it was an eye opening experience to hear them talk about the world that is yet to come through technology and science
i know that were near the end of this conference and some of you may be wondering why they have a speaker from the field of religion
richard can answer that because he made that decision
but some years ago i was on an elevator in philadelphia coming down
i was to address a conference at a hotel
and on that elevator a man said i hear billy graham is staying in this hotel
and another man looked in my direction and said yes there he is hes on this elevator with us
and this man looked me up and down for about seconds and he said my what an anticlimax
i hope that you wont feel that these few moments with me is not a is an anticlimax after all these tremendous talks that youve heard but i was on an airplane in the east some years ago and the man sitting across the aisle from me was the mayor of charlotte north carolina
his name was john belk some of you will probably know him
and there was a drunk man on there and he got up out of his seat two or three times and he was making everybody upset by what he was trying to do
and he was slapping the stewardess and pinching her as she went by and everybody was upset with him
and finally john belk said do you know whos sitting here
and the man said no who
he said its billy graham the preacher
he said you dont say
and he turned to me and he said put her there
he said your sermons have certainly helped me
and i suppose that thats true with thousands of people
i know that as you have been peering into the future and as weve heard some of it here tonight i would like to live in that age and see what is going to be
but i wont because im years old this is my eightieth year and i know that my time is brief
i have phlebitis at the moment in both legs and thats the reason that i had to have a little help in getting up here because i have parkinsons disease in addition to that and some other problems that i wont talk about
but this is not the first time that weve had a technological revolution
weve had others
and theres one that i want to talk about
in one generation the nation of the people of israel had a tremendous and dramatic change that made them a great power in the near east
a man by the name of david came to the throne and king david became one of the great leaders of his generation
he was a man of tremendous leadership
he had the favor of god with him
he was a brilliant poet philosopher writer soldier with strategies in battle and conflict that people study even today
but about two centuries before david the hittites had discovered the secret of smelting and processing of iron and slowly that skill spread
but they wouldnt allow the israelis to look into it or to have any
but david changed all of that and he introduced the iron age to israel
and the bible says that david laid up great stores of iron and which archaeologists have found that in present day palestine there are evidences of that generation
now instead of crude tools made of sticks and stones israel now had iron plows and sickles and hoes and military weapons
and in the course of one generation israel was completely changed
the introduction of iron in some ways had an impact a little bit like the microchip has had on our generation
and david found that there were many problems that technology could not solve
there were many problems still left
and theyre still with us and you havent solved them and i havent heard anybody here speak to that
how do we solve these three problems that id like to mention
the first one that david saw was human evil
where does it come from
how do we solve it
over again and again in the psalms which gladstone said was the greatest book in the world david describes the evils of the human race
and yet he says he restores my soul
have you ever thought about what a contradiction we are
on one hand we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe and dramatically push back the frontiers of technology as this conference vividly demonstrates
weve seen under the sea three miles down or galaxies hundreds of billions of years out in the future
but on the other hand something is wrong
our battleships our soldiers are on a frontier now almost ready to go to war with iraq
now what causes this
why do we have these wars in every generation and in every part of the world
and revolutions
we cant get along with other people even in our own families
we find ourselves in the paralyzing grip of self destructive habits we cant break
racism and injustice and violence sweep our world bringing a tragic harvest of heartache and death
even the most sophisticated among us seem powerless to break this cycle
i would like to see oracle take up that or some other technological geniuses work on this
how do we change man so that he doesnt lie and cheat and our newspapers are not filled with stories of fraud in business or labor or athletics or wherever
the bible says the problem is within us within our hearts and our souls
our problem is that we are separated from our creator which we call god and we need to have our souls restored something only god can do
jesus said for out of the heart come evil thoughts murders sexual immorality theft false testimonies slander
the british philosopher bertrand russell was not a religious man but he said its in our hearts that the evil lies and its from our hearts that it must be plucked out
albert einstein i was just talking to someone when i was speaking at princeton and i met mr einstein
he didnt have a doctors degree because he said nobody was qualified to give him one
but he made this statement
he said its easier to denature plutonium than to denature the evil spirit of man
and many of you im sure have thought about that and puzzled over it
youve seen people take beneficial technological advances such as the internet weve heard about tonight and twist them into something corrupting
youve seen brilliant people devise computer viruses that bring down whole systems
the oklahoma city bombing was simple technology horribly used
the problem is not technology
the problem is the person or persons using it
king david said that he knew the depths of his own soul
he couldnt free himself from personal problems and personal evils that included murder and adultery
yet king david sought gods forgiveness and said you can restore my soul
you see the bible teaches that were more than a body and a mind
we are a soul
and theres something inside of us that is beyond our understanding
thats the part of us that yearns for god or something more than we find in technology
your soul is that part of you that yearns for meaning in life and which seeks for something beyond this life
its the part of you that yearns really for god
i find young people all over the world are searching for something
they dont know what it is i speak at many universities and i have many questions and answer periods and whether its cambridge or harvard or oxford ive spoken at all of those universities
im going to harvard in about three or four no its about two months from now to give a lecture
and ill be asked the same questions that i was asked the last few times ive been there
and itll be on these questions where did i come from why am i here where am i going
whats life all about why am i here
even if you have no religious belief there are times when you wonder that theres something else
thomas edison also said when you see everything that happens in the world of science and in the working of the universe you cannot deny that theres a captain on the bridge
i remember once i sat beside mrs gorbachev at a white house dinner
i went to ambassador dobrynin whom i knew very well
and id been to russia several times under the communists and theyd given me marvelous freedom that i didnt expect
and i knew mr dobrynin very well and i said im going to sit beside mrs gorbachev tonight
what shall i talk to her about
and he surprised me with the answer
he said talk to her about religion and philosophy
thats what shes really interested in
i was a little bit surprised but that evening thats what we talked about and it was a stimulating conversation
and afterward she said you know im an atheist but i know that theres something up there higher than we are
the second problem that king david realized he could not solve was the problem of human suffering
writing the oldest book in the world was job and he said man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward
yes to be sure science has done much to push back certain types of human suffering
but im in a few months ill be years of age
i admit that im very grateful for all the medical advances that have kept me in relatively good health all these years
my doctors at the mayo clinic urged me not to take this trip out here to this to be here
i havent given a talk in nearly four months
and when you speak as much as i do three or four times a day you get rusty
thats the reason im using this podium and using these notes
every time you ever hear me on the television or somewhere im not reading i never read an address
i never read a speech or a talk or a lecture
i talk ad lib
but tonight ive got some notes here so that if i begin to forget which i do sometimes ive got something i can turn to
but even here among us most in the most advanced society in the world we have poverty
we have families that self destruct friends that betray us
unbearable psychological pressures bear down on us
ive never met a person in the world or a worry
why do we suffer its an age old question that we havent answered
yet david again and again said that he would turn to god
he said the lord is my shepherd
the final problem that david knew he could not solve was death
many commentators have said that death is the forbidden subject of our generation
most people live as if theyre never going to die
technology projects the myth of control over our mortality
we see people on our screens
marilyn monroe is just as beautiful on the screen as she was in person and our many young people think shes still alive
they dont know that shes dead
or clark gable or whoever it is
the old stars they come to life
and theyre theyre just as great on that screen as they were in person
but death is inevitable
i spoke some time ago to a joint session of congress last year
and we were meeting in that room the statue room
about of them were there
and i said theres one thing that we have in common in this room all of us together whether republican or democrat or whoever
i said were all going to die
and we have that in common with all these great men of the past that are staring down at us
and its often difficult for young people to understand that
its difficult for them to understand that theyre going to die
as the ancient writer of ecclesiastes wrote he said theres every activity under heaven
theres a time to be born and theres a time to die
ive stood at the deathbed of several famous people whom you would know
ive talked to them
ive seen them in those agonizing moments when they were scared to death
and yet a few years earlier death never crossed their mind
i talked to a woman this past week whose father was a famous doctor
she said he never thought of god never talked about god didnt believe in god he was an atheist
but she said as he came to die he sat up on the side of the bed one day and he asked the nurse if he could see the chaplain
and he said for the first time in his life hed thought about the inevitable and about god
was there a god
a few years ago a university student asked me what is the greatest surprise in your life
and i said the greatest surprise in my life is the brevity of life
it passes so fast
but it does not need to have to be that way
wernher von braun in the aftermath of world war ii concluded quote science and religion are not antagonists
on the contrary theyre sisters
he put it on a personal basis
i knew dr von braun very well
and he said speaking for myself i can only say that the grandeur of the cosmos serves only to confirm a belief in the certainty of a creator
he also said in our search to know god ive come to believe that the life of jesus christ should be the focus of our efforts and inspiration
the reality of this life and his resurrection is the hope of mankind
ive done a lot of speaking in germany and in france and in different parts of the world countries its been my privilege to speak in
and i was invited one day to visit chancellor adenauer who was looked upon as sort of the founder of modern germany since the war
and he once and he said to me he said young man he said do you believe in the resurrection of jesus christ
and i said sir i do
he said so do i
he said when i leave office im going to spend my time writing a book on why jesus christ rose again and why its so important to believe that
in one of his plays alexander solzhenitsyn depicts a man dying who says to those gathered around his bed the moment when its terrible to feel regret is when one is dying
how should one live in order not to feel regret when one is dying
blaise pascal asked exactly that question in seventeenth century france
pascal has been called the architect of modern civilization
he was a brilliant scientist at the frontiers of mathematics even as a teenager
he is viewed by many as the founder of the probability theory and a creator of the first model of a computer
and of course you are all familiar with the computer language named for him
pascal explored in depth our human dilemmas of evil suffering and death
he was astounded at the phenomenon weve been considering that people can achieve extraordinary heights in science the arts and human enterprise yet they also are full of anger hypocrisy and have and self hatreds
pascal saw us as a remarkable mixture of genius and self delusion
on november pascal had a profound religious experience
he wrote in his journal these words i submit myself absolutely to jesus christ my redeemer
a french historian said two centuries later seldom has so mighty an intellect submitted with such humility to the authority of jesus christ
pascal came to believe not only the love and the grace of god could bring us back into harmony but he believed that his own sins and failures could be forgiven and that when he died he would go to a place called heaven
he experienced it in a way that went beyond scientific observation and reason
it was he who penned the well known words the heart has its reasons which reason knows not of
equally well known is pascals wager
essentially he said this if you bet on god and open yourself to his love you lose nothing even if youre wrong
but if instead you bet that there is no god then you can lose it all in this life and the life to come
for pascal scientific knowledge paled beside the knowledge of god
the knowledge of god was far beyond anything that ever crossed his mind
he was ready to face him when he died at the age of
king david lived to be a long time in his era
yet he too had to face death and he wrote these words even though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for you are with me
this was davids answer to three dilemmas of evil suffering and death
it can be yours as well as you seek the living god and allow him to fill your life and give you hope for the future
when i was years of age i was born and reared on a farm in north carolina
i milked cows every morning and i had to milk the same cows every evening when i came home from school
and there were of them that i had that i was responsible for and i worked on the farm and tried to keep up with my studies
i didnt make good grades in high school
i didnt make them in college until something happened in my heart
one day i was faced face to face with christ
he said i am the way the truth and the life
can you imagine that i am the truth
im the embodiment of all truth
he was a liar
or he was insane
or he was what he claimed to be
which was he
i had to make that decision
i couldnt prove it
i couldnt take it to a laboratory and experiment with it
but by faith i said i believe him and he came into my heart and changed my life
and now im ready when i hear that call to go into the presence of god
thank you and god bless all of you
thank you for the privilege it was great
richard wurman you did it
thanks

title patricia ryan dont insist on english title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript patricia ryan is a longtime english teacher who asks a provocative question is the worlds focus on english preventing the spread of great ideas in other languages in other words what if einstein had to pass the toefl its a passionate defense of translating and sharing ideas description
i know what youre thinking
you think ive lost my way and somebodys going to come on the stage in a minute and guide me gently back to my seat
i get that all the time in dubai
here on holiday are you dear
come to visit the children
how long are you staying
well actually i hope for a while longer yet
i have been living and teaching in the gulf for over years
and in that time i have seen a lot of changes
now that statistic is quite shocking
and i want to talk to you today about language loss and the globalization of english
i want to tell you about my friend who was teaching english to adults in abu dhabi
and one fine day she decided to take them into the garden to teach them some nature vocabulary
but it was she who ended up learning all the arabic words for the local plants as well as their uses medicinal uses cosmetics cooking herbal
how did those students get all that knowledge
of course from their grandparents and even their great grandparents
its not necessary to tell you how important it is to be able to communicate across generations
but sadly today languages are dying at an unprecedented rate
a language dies every days
now at the same time english is the undisputed global language
could there be a connection
well i dont know
but i do know that ive seen a lot of changes
when i first came out to the gulf i came to kuwait in the days when it was still a hardship post
actually not that long ago
that is a little bit too early
but nevertheless i was recruited by the british council along with about other teachers
and we were the first non muslims to teach in the state schools there in kuwait
we were brought to teach english because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education
and of course the u k benefited from some of that lovely oil wealth
okay
now this is the major change that ive seen how teaching english has morphed from being a mutually beneficial practice to becoming a massive international business that it is today
no longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum and no longer the sole domain of mother england it has become a bandwagon for every english speaking nation on earth
and why not
after all the best education according to the latest world university rankings is to be found in the universities of the u k and the u s
so everybody wants to have an english education naturally
but if youre not a native speaker you have to pass a test
now can it be right to reject a student on linguistic ability alone
perhaps you have a computer scientist whos a genius
would he need the same language as a lawyer for example
well i dont think so
we english teachers reject them all the time
we put a stop sign and we stop them in their tracks
they cant pursue their dream any longer til they get english
now let me put it this way if i met a monolingual dutch speaker who had the cure for cancer would i stop him from entering my british university
i dont think so
but indeed that is exactly what we do
we english teachers are the gatekeepers
and you have to satisfy us first that your english is good enough
now it can be dangerous to give too much power to a narrow segment of society
maybe the barrier would be too universal
okay
but i hear you say what about the research
its all in english
so the books are in english the journals are done in english but that is a self fulfilling prophecy
it feeds the english requirement
and so it goes on
i ask you what happened to translation
if you think about the islamic golden age there was lots of translation then
they translated from latin and greek into arabic into persian and then it was translated on into the germanic languages of europe and the romance languages
and so light shone upon the dark ages of europe
now dont get me wrong i am not against teaching english all you english teachers out there
i love it that we have a global language
we need one today more than ever
but i am against using it as a barrier
do we really want to end up with languages and the main one being english or chinese
we need more than that where do we draw the line
this system equates intelligence with a knowledge of english which is quite arbitrary
and i want to remind you that the giants upon whose shoulders todays intelligentsia stand did not have to have english they didnt have to pass an english test
case in point einstein
he by the way was considered remedial at school because he was in fact dyslexic
but fortunately for the world he did not have to pass an english test
because they didnt start until with toefl the american test of english
now its exploded
there are lots and lots of tests of english
and millions and millions of students take these tests every year
now you might think you and me those fees arent bad theyre okay but they are prohibitive to so many millions of poor people
so immediately were rejecting them
it brings to mind a headline i saw recently education the great divide
now i get it i understand why people would want to focus on english
they want to give their children the best chance in life
and to do that they need a western education
because of course the best jobs go to people out of the western universities that i put on earlier
its a circular thing
okay
let me tell you a story about two scientists two english scientists
they were doing an experiment to do with genetics and the forelimbs and the hind limbs of animals
but they couldnt get the results they wanted
they really didnt know what to do until along came a german scientist who realized that they were using two words for forelimb and hind limb whereas genetics does not differentiate and neither does german
so bingo problem solved
if you cant think a thought you are stuck
but if another language can think that thought then by cooperating we can achieve and learn so much more
my daughter came to england from kuwait
she had studied science and mathematics in arabic
its an arabic medium school
she had to translate it into english at her grammar school
and she was the best in the class at those subjects
which tells us that when students come to us from abroad we may not be giving them enough credit for what they know and they know it in their own language
when a language dies we dont know what we lose with that language
this is i dont know if you saw it on cnn recently they gave the heroes award to a young kenyan shepherd boy who couldnt study at night in his village like all the village children because the kerosene lamp it had smoke and it damaged his eyes
and anyway there was never enough kerosene because what does a dollar a day buy for you
so he invented a cost free solar lamp
and now the children in his village get the same grades at school as the children who have electricity at home
when he received his award he said these lovely words the children can lead africa from what it is today a dark continent to a light continent
a simple idea but it could have such far reaching consequences
people who have no light whether its physical or metaphorical cannot pass our exams and we can never know what they know
let us not keep them and ourselves in the dark
let us celebrate diversity
mind your language
use it to spread great ideas
thank you very much

title alex steffen the shareable future of cities title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript how can cities help save the future alex steffen shows some cool neighborhood based green projects that expand our access to things we want and need while reducing the time we spend in cars description
climate change is already a heavy topic and its getting heavier because were understanding that we need to do more than we are
were understanding in fact that those of us who live in the developed world need to be really pushing towards eliminating our emissions
thats to put it mildly not whats on the table now
and it tends to feel a little overwhelming when we look at what is there in reality today and the magnitude of the problem that we face
and when we have overwhelming problems in front of us we tend to seek simple answers
and i think this is what weve done with climate change
we look at where the emissions are coming from theyre coming out of our tailpipes and smokestacks and so forth and we say okay well the problem is that theyre coming out of fossil fuels that were burning so therefore the answer must be to replace those fossil fuels with clean sources of energy
and while of course we do need clean energy i would put to you that its possible that by looking at climate change as a clean energy generation problem were in fact setting ourselves up not to solve it
and the reason why is that we live on a planet that is rapidly urbanizing
that shouldnt be news to any of us
however its hard sometimes to remember the extent of that urbanization
by mid century were going to have about eight billion perhaps more people living in cities or within a days travel of one
we will be an overwhelmingly urban species
in order to provide the kind of energy that it would take for eight billion people living in cities that are even somewhat like the cities that those of us in the global north live in today we would have to generate an absolutely astonishing amount of energy
it may be possible that we are not even able to build that much clean energy
so if were seriously talking about tackling climate change on an urbanizing planet we need to look somewhere else for the solution
the solution in fact may be closer to hand than we think because all of those cities were building are opportunities
every city determines to a very large extent the amount of energy used by its inhabitants
we tend to think of energy use as a behavioral thing i choose to turn this light switch on but really enormous amounts of our energy use are predestined by the kinds of communities and cities that we live in
i wont show you very many graphs today but if i can just focus on this one for a moment it really tells us a lot of what we need to know which is quite simply that if you look for example at transportation a major category of climate emissions there is a direct relationship between how dense a city is and the amount of climate emissions that its residents spew out into the air
and the correlation of course is that denser places tend to have lower emissions which isnt really all that difficult to figure out if you think about it
basically we substitute in our lives access to the things we want
we go out there and we hop in our cars and we drive from place to place
and were basically using mobility to get the access we need
but when we live in a denser community suddenly what we find of course is that the things we need are close by
and since the most sustainable trip is the one that you never had to make in the first place suddenly our lives become instantly more sustainable
and it is possible of course to increase the density of the communities around us
some places are doing this with new eco districts developing whole new sustainable neighborhoods which is nice work if you can get it but most of the time what were talking about is in fact reweaving the urban fabric that we already have
so were talking about things like infill development really sharp little changes to where we have buildings where were developing
urban retrofitting creating different sorts of spaces and uses out of places that are already there
increasingly were realizing that we dont even need to densify an entire city
what we need instead is an average density that rises to a level where we dont drive as much and so on
and that can be done by raising the density in very specific spots a whole lot
so you can think of it as tent poles that actually raise the density of the entire city
and we find that when we do that we can in fact have a few places that are really hyper dense within a wider fabric of places that are perhaps a little more comfortable and achieve the same results
now we may find that there are places that are really really dense and still hold onto their cars but the reality is that by and large what we see when we get a lot of people together with the right conditions is a threshold effect where people simply stop driving as much and increasingly more and more people if theyre surrounded by places that make them feel at home give up their cars altogether
and this is a huge huge energy savings because what comes out of our tailpipe is really just the beginning of the story with climate emissions from cars
we have the manufacture of the car the disposal of the car all of the parking and freeways and so on
when you can get rid of all of those because somebody doesnt use any of them really you find that you can actually cut transportation emissions as much as percent
and people are embracing this
all around the world were seeing more and more people embrace this walkshed life
people are saying that its moving from the idea of the dream home to the dream neighborhood
and when you layer that over with the kind of ubiquitous communications that were starting to see what you find is in fact even more access suffused into spaces
some of its transportation access
this is a mapnificent map that shows me in this case how far i can get from my home in minutes using public transportation
some of it is about walking its not all perfect yet
this is google walking maps
i asked how to do the greater ridgeway and it told me to go via guernsey
it did tell me that this route maybe missing sidewalks or pedestrian paths though
but the technologies are getting better and were starting to really kind of crowdsource this navigation
and as we just heard earlier of course were also learning how to put information on dumb objects
things that dont have any wiring in them at all were learning how to include in these systems of notation and navigation
part of what were finding with this is that what we thought was the major point of manufacturing and consumption which is to get a bunch of stuff is not in fact how we really live best in dense environments
what were finding is that what we want is access to the capacities of things
my favorite example is a drill who here owns a drill a home power drill
okay i do too
the average home power drill is used somewhere between six and minutes in its entire lifetime depending on who you ask
and so what we do is we buy these drills that have a potential capacity of thousands of hours of drill time use them once or twice to put a hole in the wall and let them sit
our cities i would put to you are stockpiles of these surplus capacities
and while we could try and figure out new ways to use those capacities such as cooking or making ice sculptures or even a mafia hit what we probably will find is that in fact turning those products into services that we have access to when we want them is a far smarter way to go
and in fact even space itself is turning into a service
were finding that people can share the same spaces do stuff with vacant space
buildings are becoming bundles of services
so we have new designs that are helping us take mechanical things that we used to spend energy on like heating cooling etc and turn them into things that we avoid spending energy on
so we light our buildings with daylight
we cool them with breezes we heat them with sunshine
in fact when we use all these things what weve found is that in some cases energy use in a building can drop as much as percent
which brings on another threshold effect i like to call furnace dumping which is quite simply if you have a building that doesnt need to be heated with a furnace you save a whole bunch of money up front
these things actually become cheaper to build than the alternatives
now when we look at being able to slash our product use slash our transportation use slash our building energy use all of that is great but it still leaves something behind
and if were going to really truly become sustainable cities we need to think a little differently
this is one way to do it
this is vancouvers propaganda about how green a city they are
and certainly lots of people have taken to heart this idea that a sustainable city is covered in greenery
so we have visions like this
we have visions like this we have visions like this
now all of these are fine projects but they really have missed an essential point which is its not about the leaves above its about the systems below
do they for instance capture rainwater so that we can reduce water use
water is energy intensive
do they perhaps include green infrastructure so that we can take runoff and water thats going out of our houses and clean it and filter it and grow urban street trees
do they connect us back to the ecosystems around us by for example connecting us to rivers and allowing for restoration
do they allow for pollination pollinator pathways that bees and butterflies and such can come back into our cities
do they even take the very waste matter that we have from food and fiber and so forth and turn it back into soil and sequester carbon take carbon out of the air in the process of using our cities
i would submit to you that all of these things are not only possible theyre being done right now and that its a darn good thing
because right now our economy by and large operates as paul hawken said by stealing the future selling it in the present and calling it gdp
and if we have another eight billion or seven billion or six billion even people living on a planet where their cities also steal the future were going to run out of future really fast
but if we think differently i think that in fact we can have cities that are not only zero emissions but have unlimited possibilities as well
thank you very much

title boyd varty what i learned from nelson mandela title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript in the cathedral of the wild we get to see the best parts of ourselves reflected back to us boyd varty a wildlife activist shares stories of animals humans and their interrelatedness or ubuntu defined as i am because of you and he dedicates the talk to south african leader nelson mandela the human embodiment of that same great hearted generous spirit description
im a man whos trying to live from his heart and so just before i get going i wanted to tell you as a south african that one of the men who has inspired me most passed away a few hours ago
nelson mandela has come to the end of his long walk to freedom
and so this talk is going to be for him
i grew up in wonder
i grew up amongst those animals
i grew up in the wild eastern part of south africa at a place called londolozi game reserve
its a place where my family has been in the safari business for four generations
now for as long as i can remember my job has been to take people out into nature and so i think its a lovely twist of fate today to have the opportunity to bring some of my experiences out in nature in to this gathering
africa is a place where people still sit under starlit skies and around campfires and tell stories and so what i have to share with you today is the simple medicine of a few campfire stories stories about heroes of heart
now my stories are not the stories that youll hear on the news and while its true that africa is a harsh place i also know it to be a place where people animals and ecosystems teach us about a more interconnected world
when i was nine years old president mandela came to stay with my family
he had just been released from his years of incarceration and was in a period of readjustment to his sudden global icon status
members of the african national congress thought that in the bush he would have time to rest and recuperate away from the public eye and its true that lions tend to be a very good deterrent to press and paparazzi
but it was a defining time for me as a young boy
i would take him breakfast in bed and then in an old track suit and slippers he would go for a walk around the garden
at night i would sit with my family around the snowy bunny eared tv and watch images of that same quiet man from the garden surrounded by hundreds and thousands of people as scenes from his release were broadcast nightly
he was bringing peace to a divided and violent south africa one man with an unbelievable sense of his humanity
mandela said often that the gift of prison was the ability to go within and to think to create in himself the things he most wanted for south africa peace reconciliation harmony
through this act of immense open heartedness he was to become the embodiment of what in south africa we call ubuntu
ubuntu i am because of you
or people are not people without other people
its not a new idea or value but its one that i certainly think at these times is worth building on
in fact it is said that in the collective consciousness of africa we get to experience the deepest parts of our own humanity through our interactions with others
ubuntu is at play right now
you are holding a space for me to express the deepest truth of who i am
without you im just a guy talking to an empty room and i spent a lot of time last week doing that and its not the same as this
if mandela was the national and international embodiment then the man who taught me the most about this value personally was this man solly mhlongo
solly was born under a tree kilometers from where i grew up in mozambique
he would never have a lot of money but he was to be one of the richest men i would ever meet
solly grew up tending to his fathers cattle
now i can tell you i dont know what it is about people who grow up looking after cattle but it makes for über resourcefulness
the first job that he ever got in the safari business was fixing the safari trucks
where he had learned to do that out in the bush i have no idea but he could do it
he then moved across into what we called the habitat team
these were the people on the reserve who were responsible for its well being
he fixed roads he mended wetlands he did some anti poaching
and then one day we were out together and he came across the tracks of where a female leopard had walked
and it was an old track but for fun he turned and he began to follow it and i tell you i could tell by the speed at which he moved on those pad marks that this man was a ph d level tracker
if you drove past solly somewhere out on the reserve you look up in your rearview mirror youd see hed stopped the car meters down the road just in case you need help with something
the only accusation i ever heard leveled at him was when one of our clients said solly you are pathologically helpful
when i started professionally guiding people out into this environment solly was my tracker
we worked together as a team
and the first guests we ever got were a philanthropy group from your east coast and they said to solly on the side they said before we even go out to see lions and leopards we want to see where you live
so we took them up to his house and this visit of the philanthropist to his house coincided with a time when sollys wife who was learning english was going through a phase where she would open the door by saying hello i love you
welcome i love you
and there was something so beautifully african about it to me this small house with a huge heart in it
now on the day that solly saved my life he was already my hero
it was a hot day and we found ourselves down by the river
because of the heat i took my shoes off and i rolled up my pants and i walked into the water
solly remained on the bank
the water was clear running over sand and we turned and we began to make our way upstream
and a few meters ahead of us there was a place where a tree had fallen out of the bank and its branches were touching the water and it was shadowy
and if had been a horror movie people in the audience would have started saying dont go in there dont go in there
and of course the crocodile was in the shadows
now the first thing that you notice when a crocodile hits you is the ferocity of the bite
wham it hits me by my right leg
it pulls me it turns i throw my hand up im able to grab a branch
its shaking me violently
its a very strange sensation having another creature try and eat you and there are few things that promote vegetarianism like that
solly on the bank sees that im in trouble
he turns he begins to make his way to me
the croc again continues to shake me
it goes to bite me a second time
i notice a slick of blood in the water around me that gets washed downstream
as it bites the second time i kick
my foot goes down its throat it spits me out
i pull myself up into the branches and as i come out of the water i look over my shoulder
my leg from the knee down is mangled beyond description
the bone is cracked
the meat is torn up
i make an instant decision that ill never look at that again
as i come out of the water solly arrives at a deep section a channel between us
he knows he sees the state of my leg he knows that between him and i there is a crocodile and i can tell you this man doesnt slow down for one second
he comes straight into the channel
he wades in to above his waist
he gets to me he grabs me
im still in a vulnerable position
he picks me and puts me on his shoulder
this is the other thing about solly hes freakishly strong
he turns he walks me up the bank
he lays me down he pulls his shirt off
he wraps it around my leg picks me up a second time walks me to a vehicle and hes able to get me to medical attention
and i survive
now now i dont know how many people you know that go into a deep channel of water that they know has a crocodile in it to come and help you but for solly it was as natural as breathing
and he is one amazing example of what i have experienced all over africa
in a more collective society we realize from the inside that our own well being is deeply tied to the well being of others
danger is shared pain is shared
joy is shared achievement is shared
houses are shared food is shared
ubuntu asks us to open our hearts and to share and what solly taught me that day is the essence of this value his animated empathetic action in every moment
now although the root word is about people i thought that maybe ubuntu was only about people
and then i met this young lady
her name was elvis
in fact solly gave her the name elvis because he said she walked like she was doing the elvis the pelvis dance
she was born with very badly deformed back legs and pelvis
she arrived at our reserve from a reserve east of us on her migratory route
when i first saw her i thought she would be dead in a matter of days
and yet for the next five years she returned in the winter months
and we would be so excited to be out in the bush and to come across this unusual track
it looked like an inverted bracket and we would drop whatever we were doing and we would follow and then we would come around the corner and there she would be with her herd
and that outpouring of emotion from people on our safari trucks as they saw her it was this sense of kinship
and it reminded me that even people who grow up in cities feel a natural connection with the natural world and with animals
and yet still i remained amazed that she was surviving
and then one day we came across them at this small water hole
it was sort of a hollow in the ground
and i watched as the matriarch drank and then she turned in that beautiful slow motion of elephants looks like the arm in motion and she began to make her way up the steep bank
the rest of the herd turned and began to follow
and i watched young elvis begin to psych herself up for the hill
she got visibly ears came forward she had a full go of it and halfway up her legs gave way and she fell backwards
she attempted it a second time and again halfway up she fell backwards
and on the third attempt an amazing thing happened
halfway up the bank a young teenage elephant came in behind her and he propped his trunk underneath her and he began to shovel her up the bank
and it occurred to me that the rest of the herd was in fact looking after this young elephant
the next day i watched again as the matriarch broke a branch and she would put it in her mouth and then she would break a second one and drop it on the ground
and a consensus developed between all of us who were guiding people in that area that that herd was in fact moving slower to accommodate that elephant
what elvis and the herd taught me caused me to expand my definition of ubuntu and i believe that in the cathedral of the wild we get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves reflected back at us
and it is not only through other people that we get to experience our humanity but through all the creatures that live on this planet
if africa has a gift to share its a gift of a more collective society
and while its true that ubuntu is an african idea what i see is the essence of that value being invented here
thank you
pat mitchell so boyd we know that you knew president mandela from early childhood and that you heard the news as we all did today and deeply distraught and know the tragic loss that it is to the world
but i just wondered if you wanted to share any additional thoughts because we know that you heard that news just before coming in to do this session
boyd varty well thanks pat
im so happy because it was time for him to pass on
he was suffering
and so of course theres the mixed emotions
but i just think of so many occurrences like the time he went on the oprah show and asked her what the show would be about
and she was like well itll be about you
i mean thats just incredible humility
he was the father of our nation and weve got a road to walk in south africa
and everything they used to call it madiba magic
you know he used to go to a rugby match and we would win
anywhere he went things went well
but i think that magic will be with us and the important thing is that we carry what he stood for
and so thats what im going to try and do and thats what people all over south africa are trying to do
pm and thats what youve done today bv oh thank you
pm thank you bv thank you thanks very much

and this is the second year in a row we have lost over percent of the colonies or we estimate weve lost percent of the colonies over the winter
now thats a lot a lot of bees and thats really important
and most of those losses are because of things we know
we know that there are these varroa mites that have introduced and caused a lot of losses and we also have this new phenomenon which i talked about last year colony collapse disorder
and here we see a picture on top of a hill in central valley last december
and below you can see all these out yards or temporary yards where the colonies are brought in until february and then theyre shipped out to the almonds
and one documentary writer who was here and looked at this two months after i was here described this not as beehives but as a graveyard with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them
now im going to sum up a years worth of work in two sentences to say that we have been trying to figure out what the cause of this is
and what we know is that its as if the bees have caught a flu
and this flu has wiped through the population of bees
in some cases and in fact in most cases in one year this flu was caused by a new virus to us or newly identified by us called israeli acute paralysis virus
it was called that because a guy in israel first found it and he now regrets profoundly calling it that disease because of course theres the implication
but we think this virus is pretty ubiquitous
its also pretty clear that the bees sometimes catch other viruses or other flus and so the question were still struggling with and the question that keeps us up at night is why have the bees suddenly become so susceptible to this flu and why are they so susceptible to these other diseases
and we dont have the answer to that yet and we spend a lot of time trying to figure that out
we think perhaps its a combination of factors
we know from the work of a very large and dynamic working team that you know were finding a lot of different pesticides in the hive and surprisingly sometimes the healthiest hives have the most pesticides and so we discover all these very strange things that we cant begin to understand
and so this opens up the whole idea of looking at colony health
now of course if you lose a lot of colonies beekeepers can replace them very quickly
and thats why weve been able to recover from a lot of loss
if we lost one in every three cows in the winter you know the national guard would be out
but what beekeepers can do is if they have one surviving colony they can split that colony in two
and then the one half that doesnt have a queen they can buy a queen
it comes in the mail it can come from australia or hawaii or florida and you can introduce that queen
and in fact america was the first country that ever did mail delivery queens and in fact its part of the postal code that you have to deliver queens by mail in order to make sure that we have enough bees in this country
if you dont just want a queen you can buy actually a three pound package of bees which comes in the mail and of course the postal office is always very concerned when they get you know your three pound packages of bees
and you can install this in your hive and replace that dead out
so it means that beekeepers are very good at replacing dead outs and so theyve been able to cover those losses
so even though weve lost percent of the colonies every year the same number of colonies have existed in the country at about million colonies
now those losses are tragic on many fronts and one of those fronts is for the beekeeper
and its really important to talk about beekeepers first because beekeepers are among the most fascinating people youll ever meet
if this was a group of beekeepers you would have everyone from the card carrying nra member whos you know live free or die to the you know the self expressed quirky san francisco backyard pig farmer
and you get all of these people in the same room and theyre all engaged and theyre getting along and theyre all there because of the passion for bees
now theres another part of that community which are the commercial beekeepers the ones who make their livelihood from beekeeping alone
and these tend to be some of the most independent tenacious intuitive you know inventive people you will ever meet
theyre just fascinating and theyre like that all over the world
i had the privilege of working in haiti just for two weeks earlier this year
and haiti if youve ever been there is just a tragedy
i mean there may be explanations for why haiti is the impoverished nation it is but there is no excuse to see that sort of squalor
but you meet this beekeeper and i met this beekeeper here and he is one of the most knowledgeable beekeepers ive ever met
no formal education but very knowledgeable
we needed beeswax for a project we were working on he was so capable he was able to render the nicest block of beeswax i have ever seen from cow dung tin cans and his veil which he used as a screening right in this meadow and so that ingenuity is inspiring
we also have dave hackenberg who is the poster child of ccd
hes the one who first identified this condition and raised the alarm bells
and he has a history of these trucks and hes moved these bees up and down the coast
and a lot of people talk about trucks and moving bees and that being bad but weve done that for thousands of years
the ancient egyptians used to move bees up and down the nile on rafts so this idea of a movable bee force is not new at all
and one of our real worries with colony collapse disorder is the fact that it costs so much money to replace those dead out colonies
and you can do that one year in a row you may be able to do it two years in a row
but if youre losing percent to percent of your colonies you cant survive three years in a row and were really worried about losing this segment of our industry
and thats important for many fronts and one of them is because of that culture thats in agriculture
and these migratory beekeepers are the last nomads of america
you know they pick up their hives they move their families once or twice in a year
and if you look at florida in dade city florida thats where all the pennsylvania beekeepers go
and then miles down the road is groveland and thats where all the wisconsin beekeepers go
and if youre ever in central valley in february you go to this café at oclock in the morning kathy and kates
and thats where all the beekeepers come after a night of moving bees into the almond groves
they all have their breakfast and complain about everyone right there and its a great experience and i really encourage you to drop in at that diner during that time because thats quite essential american experience
and we see these families these nomadic families you know father to son father to son and these guys are hurting
and theyre not people who like to ask for help although they are the most helpful people ever
if theres one guy who loses all his bees because of a truck overhaul everyone pitches in and gives hives to help him replace those lost colonies
and so its a very dynamic and i think historic and exciting community to be involved with
of course the real importance for bees is not the honey
and although i highly encourage you all use honey
i mean its the most ethical sweetener and you know its a dynamic and fun sweetener
but we estimate that about one in three bites of food we eat is directly or indirectly pollinated by honeybees
now i want to just illustrate that in the fact that if we look at the breakfast i had yesterday morning a little cranberry juice some fruits some granola i should have had whole wheat bread i realized but you know jam on my wonderbread and some coffee and had we taken out all those ingredients except for the almonds i wasnt going to pick out from the granola if we had taken out all those ingredients the bees had indirectly or directly pollinated we wouldnt have much on our plate
so if we did not have bees its not like we would starve but clearly our diet would be diminished
its said that for bees the flower is the fountain of life and for flowers bees are the messengers of love
and thats a really great expression because really bees are the sex workers for flowers they are you know they get paid for their services
they get paid by pollen and nectar to move that male sperm the pollen from flower to flower
and there are flowers that are self infertile that means they cant the pollen in their bloom cant fertilize themselves
so in an apple orchard for instance youll have rows of apples of one variety and then you have another apple tree thats a different type of pollen
and bees are very faithful
when theyre out pollinating or gathering pollen from one flower they stay to that crop exclusively in order to help generate
and of course theyre made to carry this pollen
they build up a static electric charge and the pollen jumps on them and helps spread that pollen from bloom to bloom
however honeybees are a minority
honeybees are not native to america they were introduced with the colonialists
and there are actually more species of bees than there are mammals and birds combined
in pennsylvania alone we have been surveying bees for years and very intensely in the last three years
we have identified over species of bees in pennsylvania
thirty two species have not been identified or found in the state since
now that could be because we havent been sampling right but it does i think suggest that somethings wrong with the pollinator force and these bees are fascinating
we have bumblebees on the top
and bumblebees are what we call eusocial theyre not truly social because only the queen is over winter
we also have the sweat bees and these are little gems flying around
theyre like tiny little flies and they fly around
and then you have another type of bee which we call kleptoparasites which is a very fancy way of saying bad minded murdering whats the word im looking for murdering audience bee
dennis vanengelsdorp bee okay thanks
what these bees do is they sit there these solitary bees they drill a hole in the ground or drill a hole in a branch and they collect pollen and make it into a ball and they lay an egg on it
well these bees hang out at that hole and they wait for that mother to fly away they go in eat the egg and lay their own egg there so they dont do any work
and so in fact if you know you have these kleptoparasitic bees you know that your environment is healthy because theyre top of the food chain bees
and in fact there is now a red list of pollinators that were worried have disappeared and on top of that list are a lot of these kleptoparasites but also these bumblebees
and in fact if you guys live on the west coast go to these websites here and theyre really looking for people to look for some of these bumblebees because we think some have gone extinct or some the population has declined
and so its not just honeybees that are in trouble but we dont understand these native pollinators or all those other parts of our community
and of course bees are not the only important factor here
there are other animals that pollinate like bats and bats are in trouble too
and im glad im a bee man and not a bat man because theres no money to research the bat problems
and bats are dying at an extraordinary rate
white nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats
if theres a cave in new york that had bats in it and there are left thats like san francisco becoming the population of half of this county in three years
and so thats incredible and theres no money to do that
but im glad to say that i think we know the cause of all these conditions and that cause is ndd nature deficit disorder
and that is that i think that what we have in our society is we forgot our connection with nature
and i think if we reconnect to nature well be able to have the resources and that interest to solve these problems
and i think that there is an easy cure for ndd
and that is make meadows and not lawns
and i think we have lost our connection and this is a wonderful way of reconnecting to our environment
ive had the privilege of living by a meadow for the last little while and it is terribly engaging
and if we look at the history of lawns its actually rather tragic
it used to be two three hundred years ago that a lawn was a symbol of prestige and so it was only the very rich that could keep these green actually deserts theyre totally sterile
americans spent in percent of all pesticide use was done on lawns
five percent of our greenhouse gases are produced by mowing our lawns
and so its incredible the amount of resources weve spent keeping our lawns which are these useless biosystems
and so we need to rethink this idea
in fact you know the white house used to have sheep in front in order to help fund the war effort in world war i which probably is not a bad idea it wouldnt be a bad idea
i want to say this not because im opposed completely to mowing lawns
i think that there is perhaps some advantage to keeping lawns at a limited scale and i think were encouraged to do that
but i also want to reinforce some of the ideas weve heard here because having a meadow or living by a meadow is transformational
that it is amazing that connection we can have with whats there
these milkweed plants have grown up in my meadow over the last four years add to watch the different plants or insects that come to these flowers to watch that and weve heard about you know this relationship you can have with wine this companion you can have as it matures and as it has these different fragrances
and this is a companion and this is a relationship that never dries up
you never run out of that companion as you drink this wine too
and i encourage you to look at that
now not all of us have meadows or lawns that we can convert and so you can always of course grow a meadow in a pot
bees apparently can be the gateway to you know other things
so im not saying that you should plant a meadow of pot but a pot in a meadow
but you can also have this great community of city or building top beekeepers these beekeepers that live this is in paris where these beekeepers live
and everyone should open a beehive because it is the most amazing incredible thing
and if we want to cure ourselves of ndd or nature deficit disorder i think this is a great way of doing it
get a beehive and grow a meadow and watch that life come back into your life
and so with that i think that what we can do if we do this we can make sure that our future our more perfect future includes beekeepers and it includes bees and it includes those meadows
and that journey that journey of transformation that occurs as you grow your meadow and as you keep your bees or you watch those native bees there is an extremely exciting one
and i hope that you experience it and i hope you tell me about it one day
so thank you very much for being here thank you very much

title steven johnson the web as a city title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript outside ins steven johnson says the web is like a city built by many people completely controlled by no one intricately interconnected and yet functioning as many independent parts while disaster strikes in one place elsewhere life goes on description
i want to take you back basically to my hometown and to a picture of my hometown of the week that emergence came out
and its a picture weve seen several times
basically emergence was published on
i live right there in the west village so the plume was luckily blowing west away from us
we had a two and a half day old baby in the house that was ours we hadnt taken it from somebody else
and one of the thoughts that i had dealing with these two separate emergences of a book and a baby and having this event happen so close that my first thought when i was still kind of in the apartment looking out at it all or walking out on the street and looking out on it just in front of our building was that id made a terrible miscalculation in the book that id just written
because so much of that book was a celebration of the power and creative potential of density of largely urban density of connecting people and putting them together in one place and putting them on sidewalks together and having them share ideas and share physical space together
and it seemed to me looking at that that tower burning and then falling those towers burning and falling that in fact one of the lessons here was that density kills
and that of all the technologies that were exploited to make that carnage come into being probably the single group of technologies that cost the most lives were those that enable people to live in two buildings stories above the ground
if they hadnt been crowded you compare the loss of life at the pentagon to the twin towers and you can see that very powerfully
and so i started to think well you know density density im not sure if you know this was the right call
and i kind of ruminated on that for a couple of days
and then about two days later the wind started to change a little bit and you could sense that the air was not healthy
and so even though there were no cars still in the west village where we lived my wife sent me out to buy a you know a large air filter at the bed bath and beyond which was located about blocks away north
and so i went out
and obviously im physically a very strong person as you can tell so i wasnt worried about carrying this thing blocks
and i walked out and this really miraculous thing happened to me as i was walking north to buy this air filter which was that the streets were completely alive with people
there was an incredible it was you know a beautiful day as it was for about a week after and the west village had never seemed more lively
i walked up along hudson street where jane jacobs had lived and written her great book that so influenced what i was writing in emergence past the white horse tavern that great old bar where dylan thomas drank himself to death and the bleecker street playground was filled with kids
and all the people who lived in the neighborhood who owned restaurants and bars in the neighborhood were all out there had them all open
people were out
there were no cars so it seemed even better in some ways
and it was a beautiful urban day and the incredible thing about it was that the city was working
the city was there
all the things that make a great city successful and all the things that make a great city stimulating they were all on display there on those streets
and i thought well this is the power of a city
i mean the power of the city we talked about cities as being centralized in space but what makes them so strong most of the time is theyre decentralized in function
they dont have a center executive branch that you can take out and cause the whole thing to fail
if they did it probably was right there at ground zero
i mean you know the emergency bunker was right there was destroyed by the attacks and obviously the damage done to the building and the lives
but nonetheless just blocks north two days later the city had never looked more alive
if youd gone into the minds of the people well you would have seen a lot of trauma and you would have seen a lot of heartache and you would have seen a lot of things that would take a long time to recover
but the system itself of this city was thriving
so i took heart in seeing that
so i wanted to talk a little bit about the reasons why that works so well and how some of those reasons kind of map on to where the web is going right now
the question that i found myself asking to people when i was talking about the book afterwards is when youve talked about emergent behavior when youve talked about collective intelligence the best way to get people to kind of wrap their heads around that is to ask who builds a neighborhood
who decides that soho should have this personality and that the latin quarter should have this personality
well there are some kind of executive decisions but mostly the answer is everybody and nobody
everybody contributes a little bit
no single person is really the ultimate actor behind the personality of a neighborhood
same thing to the question of who was keeping the streets alive post in my neighborhood
well it was the whole city
the whole system kind of working on it and everybody contributing a small little part
and this is increasingly what were starting to see on the web in a bunch of interesting ways most of which werent around actually except in very experimental things when i was writing emergence and when the book came out
so its been a very optimistic time i think and i want to just talk about a few of those things
i think that there is effectively a new kind of model of interactivity thats starting to emerge online right now
and the old one looked like this
this is not the future king of england although it looks like it
its some guy its a geocities homepage of some guy that i found online whos interested if you look at the bottom in soccer and jesus and garth brooks and clint beckham and my hometown those are his links
but nothing really says this model of interactivity which was so exciting and captures the real the web zeitgeist of than click here for a picture of my dog
that is you know theres no sentence that kind of conjures up that period better than that i think which is that you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of your dog and link to it and somebody reading the page has the power to click on that link or not click on that link
and you know i dont want to belittle that that in a sense to reference what jeff was talking about yesterday that was in a sense the kind of interface electricity that powered a lot of the explosion of interest in the web that you could put up a link and somebody could click on it and it could take you anywhere you wanted to go
but its still a very one to one kind of relationship
theres one person putting up the link and theres another person on the other end trying to decide whether to click on it or not
the new model is much more like this and weve already seen a couple of references to this
this is what happens when you search steven johnson on google
about two months ago i had the great breakthrough one of my great kind of shining achievements which is that my website finally became a top result for steven johnson
theres some theoretical physicist at mit named steven johnson who has dropped two spots im happy to say
and you know i mean ill look at a couple of things like this but google is obviously the greatest technology ever invented for navel gazing
its just that there are so many other people in your navel when you gaze
because effectively whats happening here whats creating this page obviously and we all know this but its worth just thinking about it is not some person deciding that i am the number one answer for steven johnson but rather somehow the entire web of people putting up pages and deciding to link to my page or not link to it and google just sitting there and running the numbers
so theres this collective decision making thats going on
this page is effectively collectively authored by the web and google is just helping us kind of to put the authorship in one kind of coherent place
now theyre more innovative well googles pretty innovative but there are some new twists on this
theres this incredibly interesting new site technorati thats filled with lots of little widgets that are expanding on these
and these are looking in the blog world and the world of weblogs
hes analyzed basically all the weblogs out there that hes tracking
and hes tracking how many other weblogs linked to those weblogs and so you have kind of an authority a weblog that has a lot of links to it is more authoritative than a weblog that has few links to it
and so at any given time on any given page on the web actually you can say what does the weblog community think about this page
and you can get a list
this is what they think about my site its ranked by blog authority
you can also rank it by the latest posts
so when i was talking in emergence i talked about the limitations of the one way linking architecture that basically you could link to somebody else but they wouldnt necessarily know that you were pointing to them
and that was one of the reasons why the web wasnt quite as emergent as it could be because you needed two way linking you needed that kind of feedback mechanism to be able to really do interesting things
well something like technorati is supplying that
now whats interesting here is that this is a quote from dave weinberger where he talks about everything being purposive in the web theres nothing artificial
he has this line where he says you know youre going to put up a link there if you see a link somebody decided to put it there
and he says the link to one site didnt just grow on the other page like a tree fungus
and in fact i think thats not entirely true anymore
i could put up a feed of all those links generated by technorati on the right hand side of my page and they would change as the overall ecology of the web changes
that little list there would change
i wouldnt really be directly in control of it
so its much closer in a way to a data fungus in a sense wrapped around that page than it is to a deliberate link that ive placed there
now what youre having here is basically a global brain that youre able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what its thinking
and there are all these interesting tools
google does the google zeitgeist which looks at search requests to test whats going on what people are interested in and they publish it with lots of fun graphs
and im saying a lot of nice things about google so ill be ill be saying one little critical thing
theres a problem with the google zeitgeist which is it often comes back with news that a lot of people are searching for britney spears pictures which is not necessarily news
the columbia blows up suddenly there are a lot of searches on columbia
well you know we should expect to see that
thats not necessarily something we didnt know already
so the key thing in terms of these new tools that are kind of plumbing the depths of the global brain that are sending kind of trace dyes through that whole bloodstream the question is are you finding out something new
and one of the things that i experimented with is this thing called google share which is basically you take an abstract term and you search google for that term and then you search the results that you get back for somebodys name
so basically the number of pages that mention this term that also mention this page the percentage of those pages is that persons google share of that term
so you can do kind of interesting contests
like for instance this is a google share of the ted conference
so richard saul wurman has about a percent google share of the ted conference
but the interesting thing is you can broaden the search a little bit
and it turns out actually that percent is the mola mola fish
i had no idea
no thats not true
i made that up because i just wanted to put up a slide of the mola mola fish
i also did and i dont want to start a little fight in the next panel but i did a google share analysis of evolution and natural selection
so right here now this is a big category you have smaller percentages so this is percent dan dennett wholl be speaking shortly
right below him percent steven pinker
so dennetts in the lead a little bit there
but whats interesting is you can then broaden the search and actually see interesting things and get a sense of what else is out there
so gary bauer is not too far behind has slightly different theories about evolution and natural selection
and right behind him is l ron hubbard so you can see were in the ascot which is always good
and by the way chris that wouldve been a really good panel i think right there
hubbard apparently started to reach but besides that i think it would be good next year
another quick thing this is a slightly different thing but this analysis some of you may have seen
it just came out this is bursty words looking at the historical record of state of the union addresses
so these are words that suddenly start to appear out of nowhere so theyre kind of you know memes that start taking off that didnt have a lot of historical precedent before
so the first one is these are the bursty words around slaves emancipation slavery rebellion kansas
thats britney spears i mean you know ok interesting
theyre talking about slavery in
relief depression recovery banks
and ok i didnt learn anything new there as well thats pretty obvious
right at the center of the reagan years thats were theres weve its
now theres one way to interpret this which is to say that emancipation and depression and recovery all have a lot of syllables
so you know you can actually download its hard to remember those
but seriously actually what you can see there in a way that would be very hard to detect otherwise is reagan reinventing the political language of the country and shifting to a much more intimate much more folksy much more telegenic contracting all those verbs
you know years before it was still ask not what you can do but with reagan its thats where theres nancy and i that kind of language
and so something we kind of knew but you didnt actually notice syntactically what he was doing
ill go very quickly
the question now and this is the really interesting question is what kind of higher level shape is emerging right now in the overall web ecosystem and particularly in the ecosystem of the blogs because they are really kind of at the cutting edge
and i think what happens there will also happen in the wider system
now there was a very interesting article by clay shirky that got a lot of attention about a month ago and this is basically the distribution of links on the web to all these various different blogs
it follows a power law so that there are a few extremely well linked to popular blogs and a long tail of blogs with very few links
so percent of the blogs get percent of the links
now this is a very interesting thing
its caused a lot of controversy because people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man one modem democracy where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard
and so the question is why is this happening
its not being imposed by fiat from above
its an emergent property of the blogosphere right now
now whats great about it is that people are working on within seconds of clay publishing this piece people started working on changing the underlying rules of the system so that a different shape would start appearing
and basically the shape appears largely because of a kind of a first mover advantage
if youre the first site there everybody links to you
if youre the second site there most people link to you
and so very quickly you can accumulate a bunch of links and it makes it more likely for newcomers to link to you in the future and then you get this kind of shape
and so what dave sifry at technorati started working on literally as shirky started after he published his piece was something that basically just gave a new kind of priority to newcomers
and he started looking at interesting newcomers that dont have a lot of links that suddenly get a bunch of links in the last hours
so in a sense bursty weblogs coming from new voices
so hes working on a tool right there that can actually change the overall system
and it creates a kind of planned emergence
youre not totally in control but youre changing the underlying rules in interesting ways because you have an end result which is maybe a more democratic spread of voices
so the most amazing thing about this and ill end on this note is most emergent systems most self organizing systems are not made up of component parts that are capable of looking at the overall pattern and changing their behavior based on whether they like the pattern or not
so the most wonderful thing i think about this whole debate about power laws and software that could change it is the fact that were having the conversation
i hope it continues here
thanks a lot

title eve ensler embrace your inner girl title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript in this passionate talk eve ensler declares that there is a girl cell in us all a cell that we have all been taught to suppress she tells heartfelt stories of girls around the world who have overcome shocking adversity and violence to reveal the astonishing strength of being a girl description
namaste good morning
im very happy to be here in india
and ive been thinking a lot about what i have learned over these last particularly years with v day and the vagina monologues traveling the world essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet to stop violence against women
what i want to talk about today is this particular cell or grouping of cells that is in each and every one of us
and i want to call it the girl cell
and its in men as well as in women
i want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells is central to the evolution of our species and the continuation of the human race
and i want you imagine that at some point in history a group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world understood that the suppression of this particular cell the oppression of these cells the reinterpretation of these cells the undermining of these cells getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells and the crushing eradicating destroying reducing these cells basically began the process of killing off the girl cell which was by the way patriarchy
i want you to imagine that the girl is a chip in the huge macrocosm of collective consciousness
and it is essential to balance to wisdom and to actually the future of all of us
and then i want you to imagine that this girl cell is compassion and its empathy and its passion itself and its vulnerability and its openness and its intensity and its association and its relationship and it is intuitive
and then lets think how compassion informs wisdom and that vulnerability is our greatest strength and that emotions have inherent logic which lead to radical appropriate saving action
and then lets remember that weve been taught the exact opposite by the powers that be that compassion clouds your thinking that vulnerability is weakness that emotions are not to be trusted and youre not supposed to take things personally which is one of my favorites
i think the whole world has essentially been brought up not to be a girl
how do we bring up boys what does it mean to be a boy
to be a boy really means not to be a girl
to be a man means not to be a girl
to be a woman means not to be a girl
to be strong means not to be a girl
to be a leader means not to be a girl
i actually think that being a girl is so powerful that weve had to train everyone not to be that
and id also like to say that the irony of course is that denying girl suppressing girl suppressing emotion refusing feeling has lead thus here
where we have now come to live in a world where the most extreme forms of violence the most horrific poverty genocide mass rapes the destruction of the earth is completely out of control
and because we have suppressed our girl cells and suppressed our girl ship we do not feel what is going on
so we are not being charged with the adequate response to what is happening
i want to talk a little bit about the democratic republic of congo
for me it was the turning point of my life
i have spent a lot of time there in the last three years
i feel up to that point i had seen a lot in the world a lot of violence
i essentially lived in the rape mines of the world for the last years
but the democratic republic of congo really was the turning point in my soul
i went and i spent time in a place called bukavu in a hospital called the panzi hospital with a doctor who was as close to a saint as any person ive ever met
his name is dr denis mukwege
in the congo for those of you who dont know there has been a war raging for the last years a war that has killed nearly six million people
it is estimated that somewhere between and women have been raped there
when i spent my first weeks at panzi hospital i sat with women who sat and lined up every day to tell me their stories
their stories were so horrific and so mind blowing and so on the other side of human existence that to be perfectly honest with you i was shattered
and i will tell you that what happened is through that shattering listening to the stories of eight year old girls who had their insides eviscerated who had guns and bayonets and things shoved inside them so they had holes literally inside them where their pee and poop came out of them
listening to the story of year old women who were tied to chains and circled and where groups of men would come and rape them periodically all in the name of economic exploitation to steal the minerals so the west can have it and profit from them
my mind was so shattered
but what happened for me is that that shattering actually emboldened me in a way i have never been emboldened
that shattering that opening of my girl cell that kind of massive breakthrough of my heart allowed me to become more courageous and braver and actually more clever than i had been in the past in my life
i want to say that i think the powers that be know that empire building is actually that feelings get in the way of empire building
feelings get in the way of the mass acquisition of the earth and excavating the earth and destroying things
i remember for example when my father who was very very violent used to beat me
and he would actually say while he was beating me dont you cry dont you dare cry
because my crying somehow exposed his brutality to him
and even in the moment he didnt want to be reminded of what he was doing
i know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell
and i want to say weve annihilated it in men as well as in women
and i think in some ways weve been much harsher to men in the annihilation of their girl cell
i see how boys have been brought up and i see this across the planet to be tough to be hardened to distance themselves from their tenderness to not cry
i actually realized once in kosovo when i watched a man break down that bullets are actually hardened tears that when we dont allow men to have their girl self and have their vulnerability and have their compassion and have their hearts that they become hardened and hurtful and violent
and i think we have taught men to be secure when they are insecure to pretend they know things when they dont know things or why would we be where we are
to pretend theyre not a mess when they are a mess
and i will tell you a very funny story
on my way here on the airplane i was walking up and down the aisle of the plane
and all these men literally at least men were in their little seats watching chick flicks
and they were all alone and i thought this is the secret life of men
ive traveled as i said to many many countries and ive seen if we do what we do to the girl inside us then obviously its horrific to think what we do to girls in the world
and we heard from sunitha yesterday and kavita about what we do to girls
but i just want to say that ive met girls with knife wounds and cigarette burns who are literally being treated like ashtrays
ive seen girls be treated like garbage cans
ive seen girls who were beaten by their mothers and brothers and fathers and uncles
ive seen girls starving themselves to death in america in institutions to look like some idealized version of themselves
ive seen that we cut girls and we control them and we keep them illiterate or we make them feel bad about being too smart
we silence them we make them feel guilty for being smart we get them to behave to tone it down not to be too intense
we sell them we kill them as embryos we enslave them we rape them
we are so accustomed to robbing girls of the subject of being the subjects of their lives that we have now actually objectified them and turned them into commodities
the selling of girls is rampant across the planet
and in many places they are worth less than goats and cows
but i also want to talk about the fact that if one in eight people on the planet are girls between the ages of to they are they key really in the developing world as well as in the whole world to the future of humanity
and if girls are in trouble because they face systematic disadvantages that keep them where society wants them to be including lack of access to healthcare education healthy foods labor force participation
the burden of all the household tasks usually falls on girls and younger siblings which ensures that they will never overcome these barriers
the state of girls the condition of girls will in my belief and thats the girl inside us and the girl in the world determine whether the species survives
and what i want to suggest is that having talked to girls because i just finished a new book called i am an emotional creature the secret life of girls around the world ive been talking to girls for five years and one of the things that ive seen is true everywhere is that the verb thats been enforced on girl is the verb to please
girls are trained to please
i want to change the verb
i want us all to change the verb
i want the verb to be educate or activate or engage or confront or defy or create
if we teach girls to change the verb we will actually enforce the girl inside us and the girl inside them
and i have to now share a few stories of girls ive seen across the planet who have engaged their girl who have taken on their girl in spite of all the circumstances around them
i know a year old girl in the netherlands for example who is demanding that she take a boat and go around the entire world by herself
there is a teenage girl who just recently went out and knew that she needed stars tattooed on the right side of her face
there is a girl julia butterfly hill who lived for a year in a tree because she wanted to protect the wild oaks
there is a girl who i met years ago in afghanistan who i have adopted as my daughter because her mother was killed her mother was a revolutionary
and this girl when she was years old wore a burqa in afghanistan and went into the stadiums and documented the atrocities that were going on towards women underneath her burqa with a video
and that video became the video that went out all over the world after to show what was going on in afghanistan
i want to talk about rachel corrie who was in her teens when she stood in front of an israeli tank to say end the occupation
and she knew she risked death and she was literally gunned down and rolled over by that tank
and i want to talk about a girl that i just met recently in bukavu who was impregnated by her rapist
and she was holding her baby
and i asked her if she loved her baby
and she looked into her babys eyes and she said of course i love my baby how could i not love my baby
its my baby and its full of love
the capacity for girls to overcome situations and to move on levels to me is mind blowing
there is a girl named dorcas and i just met her in kenya
dorcas is years old and she was trained in self defense
a few months ago she was picked up on the street by three older men
they kidnapped her they put her in a car
and through her self defense she grabbed their adams apples she punched them in the eyes and she got herself free and out of the car
in kenya in august i went to visit one of the v day safe houses for girls a house we opened seven years ago with an amazing woman named agnes pareyio
agnes was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl she was female genitally mutilated
and she made a decision as many women do across this planet that what was done to her would not be enforced and done to other women and girls
so for years agnes walked through the rift valley
she taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like and what a mutilated vagina looked like
and in that time she saved many girls and when we met her we asked her what we could do for her and she said well if you got me a jeep i could get around a lot faster
so we got her a jeep and then she saved girls
and then we asked her okay what else do you need
and she said well now i need a house
so seven years ago agnes built the first v day safe house in narok kenya in the masai land
and it was a house where girls could run away they could save their clitoris they wouldnt be cut they could go to school
and in the years that agnes has had the house she has changed the situation there
she has literally become deputy mayor
shes changed the rules
the whole community has bought in to what shes doing
when we were there she was doing a ritual where she reconciles girls who have run away with their families
and there was a young girl named jaclyn
jaclyn was years old and she was in her masai family and theres a drought in kenya
so cows are dying and cows are the most valued possession
and jaclyn overheard her father talking to an old man about how he was about to sell her for the cows
and she knew that meant she would be cut
she knew that meant she wouldnt go to school
she knew that meant she wouldnt have a future
she knew she would have to marry that old man and she was
so one afternoon shed heard about the safe house jaclyn left her fathers house and she walked for two days two days through masai land
she slept with the hyenas she hid at night
she imagined her father killing her on one hand and mama agnes greeting her with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house
and when she got to the house she was greeted
agnes took her in and agnes loved her and agnes supported her for the year
she went to school and she found her voice and she found her identity and she found her heart
then her time was ready when she had to go back to talk to her father about the reconciliation after a year
i had the privilege of being in the hut when she was reunited with her father and reconciled
in that hut we walked in and her father and his four wives were sitting there and her sisters who had just returned because they had all fled when she had fled and her primary mother who had been beaten in standing up for her with the elders
when her father saw her and saw who she had become in her full girl self he threw his arms around her and broke down crying
he said you are beautiful you have grown into a gorgeous woman
we will not cut you
and i give you my word here and now that we will not cut your sisters either
and what she said to him was you were willing to sell me for four cows and a calf and some blankets
but i promise you now that i will be educated i will always take care of you and i will come back and i will build you a house
and i will be in your corner for the rest of your life
for me that is the power of girls
and that is the power of transformation
i want to close today with a new piece from my book
and i want to do it tonight for the girl in everybody here
and i want to do it for sunitha
and i want to do it for the girls that sunitha talked about yesterday the girls who survive the girls who can become somebody else
but i really want to do it for each and every person here to value the girl in us to value the part that cries to value the part thats emotional to value the part thats vulnerable to understand thats where the future lies
this is called im an emotional creature
and it happened because i met a girl in watts l a
i was asking girls if they like being a girl and all the girls were like no i hate it i cant stand it
its all bad my brothers get everything
and this girl just sat up and went i love being a girl
im an emotional creature
this is for her i love being a girl
i can feel what youre feeling as youre feeling inside the feeling before
i am an emotional creature
things do not come to me as intellectual theories or hard pressed ideas
they pulse through my organs and legs and burn up my ears
oh i know when your girlfriends really pissed off even though she appears to give you what you want
i know when a storm is coming
i can feel the invisible stirrings in the air
i can tell you he wont call back its a vibe i share
i am an emotional creature
i love that i do not take things lightly
everything is intense to me the way i walk in the street the way my momma wakes me up the way its unbearable when i lose the way i hear bad news
i am an emotional creature
i am connected to everything and everyone i was born like that
dont you say all negative that its only only a teenage thing or its only because im a girl
these feelings make me better
they make me present they make me ready they make me strong
i am an emotional creature
there is a particular way of knowing
its like the older women somehow forgot
i rejoice that its still in my body
oh i know when the coconuts about to fall
i know we have pushed the earth too far
i know my father isnt coming back and that no ones prepared for the fire
i know that lipstick means more than show and boys are super insecure and so called terrorists are made not born
i know that one kiss could take away all my decision making ability
and you know what sometimes it should
this is not extreme its a girl thing what we would all be if the big door inside us flew open
dont tell me not to cry to calm it down not to be so extreme to be reasonable
i am an emotional creature
its how the earth got made how the wind continues to pollinate
you dont tell the atlantic ocean to behave
i am an emotional creature
why would you want to shut me down or turn me off
i am your remaining memory
i can take you back
nothings been diluted
nothings leaked out
i love hear me i love that i can feel the feelings inside you even if they stop my life even if they break my heart even if they take me off track they make me responsible
i am an emotional i am an emotional incondotional devotional creature
and i love hear me i love love love being a girl
can you say it with me
i love i love love love being a girl
thank you very much

title rives the a m mystery title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript poet rives does minutes of lyrical origami folding history into a series of coincidences surrounding that most surreal of hours oclock in the morning description
this is a recent comic strip from the los angeles times
the punch line
on the other hand i dont have to get up at four every single morning to milk my labrador
this is a recent cover of new york magazine
best hospitals where doctors say they would go for cancer treatment births strokes heart disease hip replacements a m emergencies
and this is a song medley i put together did you ever notice that four in the morning has become some sort of meme or shorthand
it means something like you are awake at the worst possible hour
a time for inconveniences mishaps yearnings
a time for plotting to whack the chief of police like in this classic scene from the godfather
coppolas script describes these guys as exhausted in shirt sleeves
it is four in the morning
a time for even grimmer stuff than that like autopsies and embalmings in isabel allendes the house of the spirits
after the breathtaking green haired rosa is murdered the doctors preserve her with unguents and morticians paste
they worked until four oclock in the morning
a time for even grimmer stuff than that like in last aprils new yorker magazine
this short fiction piece by martin amis starts out on september he opened his eyes at a m in portland maine and mohamed attas last day began
for a time that i find to be the most placid and uneventful hour of the day four in the morning sure gets an awful lot of bad press across a lot of different media from a lot of big names
and it made me suspicious
i figured surely some of the most creative artistic minds in the world really arent all defaulting back to this one easy trope like they invented it right
could it be there is something more going on here
something deliberate something secret and who got the four in the morning bad rap ball rolling anyway
i say this guy alberto giacometti shown here with some of his sculptures on the swiss franc note
he did it with this famous piece from the new york museum of modern art
its title the palace at four in the morning
not just the earliest cryptic reference to four in the morning i can find
i believe that this so called first surrealist sculpture may provide an incredible key to virtually every artistic depiction of four in the morning to follow it
i call this the giacometti code a ted exclusive
no feel free to follow along on your blackberries or your iphones if youve got them
it works a little something like this is a recent google search for four in the morning
results vary of course this is pretty typical
the top results yield you four hits for faron youngs song its four in the morning three hits for judi denchs film four in the morning one hit for wislawa szymborskas poem four in the morning
but what you may ask do a polish poet a british dame a country music hall of famer all have in common besides this totally excellent google ranking
well lets start with faron young who was born incidentally in
in he shot himself in the head on december ninth which incidentally is judi denchs birthday
but he didnt die on denchs birthday
he languished until the following afternoon when he finally succumbed to a supposedly self inflicted gunshot wound at the age of which incidentally is how old alberto giacometti was when he died
where was wislawa szymborska during all this
she has the worlds most absolutely watertight alibi
on that very day december while mr four in the morning faron young was giving up the ghost in nashville tennessee ms four in the morning or one of them anyway wislawa szymborska was in stockholm sweden accepting the nobel prize for literature
years to the day after the death of alfred nobel himself
coincidence no its creepy
coincidence to me has a much simpler metric
thats like me telling you hey you know the nobel prize was established in which coincidentally is the same year alberto giacometti was born
no not everything fits so tidily into the paradigm but that does not mean theres not something going on at the highest possible levels
in fact there are people in this room who may not want me to show you this clip were about to see
video homer simpson we have a tennis court a swimming pool a screening room you mean if i want pork chops even in the middle of the night your guy will fry them up
herbert powell sure thats what hes paid for
now do you need towels laundry maids
hs wait wait wait wait wait wait let me see if i got this straight
it is christmas day a m
theres a rumble in my stomach
marge simpson homer please
rives wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
let me see if i got this straight matt
when homer simpson needs to imagine the most remote possible moment of not just the clock but the whole freaking calendar he comes up with on the birthday of the baby jesus
and no i dont know how it works into the whole puzzling scheme of things but obviously i know a coded message when i see one
i said i know a coded message when i see one
and folks you can buy a copy of bill clintons my life from the bookstore here at ted
parse it cover to cover for whatever hidden references you want
or you can go to the random house website where there is this excerpt
and how far down into it you figure well have to scroll to get to the golden ticket
would you believe about a dozen paragraphs
this is page on your paperbacks if youre following along though it was getting better i still wasnt satisfied with the inaugural address
my speechwriters must have been tearing their hair out because as we worked between one and four in the morning on inauguration day i was still changing it
sure you were because youve prepared your entire life for this historic quadrennial event that just sort of sneaks up on you
and then three paragraphs later we get this little beauty we went back to blair house to look at the speech for the last time
it had gotten a lot better since a m
well how could it have
by his own writing this man was either asleep at a prayer meeting with al and tipper or learning how to launch a nuclear missile out of a suitcase
what happens to american presidents at on inauguration day
what happened to william jefferson clinton
we might not ever know
and i noticed hes not exactly around here today to face any tough questions
it could get awkward right
i mean after all this whole business happened on his watch
but if he were here he might remind us as he does in the wrap up to his fine autobiography that on this day bill clinton began a journey a journey that saw him go on to become the first democrat president elected to two consecutive terms in decades
in generations
the first since this man franklin delano roosevelt who began his own unprecedented journey way back at his own first election way back in a simpler time way back in the year alberto giacometti made the palace at four in the morning
the year lets remember that this voice now departed first came a cryin into this big old crazy world of ours

title george dyson the birth of the computer title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript historian george dyson tells stories from the birth of the modern computer from its century origins to the hilarious notebooks of some early computer engineers description
last year i told you the story in seven minutes of project orion which was this very implausible technology that technically could have worked but it had this one year political window where it could have happened
so it didnt happen it was a dream that did not happen
this year im going to tell you the story of the birth of digital computing
this was a perfect introduction
and its a story that did work it did happen and the machines are all around us
and it was a technology that was inevitable
if the people im going to tell you the story about if they hadnt done it somebody else would have
so it was sort of the right idea at the right time
this is barricellis universe this is the universe we live in now
its the universe in which these machines are now doing all these things including changing biology
im starting the story with the first atomic bomb at trinity which was the manhattan project it was a little bit like ted it brought a whole lot of very smart people together
and three of the smartest people were stan ulam richard feynman and john von neumann
and it was von neumann who said after the bomb he was working on something much more important than bombs hes thinking about computers
so he wasnt only thinking about them he built one this is the machine he built
he built this machine and we had a beautiful demonstration of how this thing really works with these little bits and its an idea that goes way back
the first person to really explain that was thomas hobbes who in explained how arithmetic and logic are the same thing and if you want to do artificial thinking and artificial logic you can do it all with arithmetic
he said you needed addition and subtraction
leibniz who came a little bit later this is showed that you didnt even need subtraction
you could do the whole thing with addition
here we have all the binary arithmetic and logic that drove the computer revolution
and leibniz was the first person to really talk about building such a machine
he talked about doing it with marbles having gates and what we now call shift registers where you shift the gates drop the marbles down the tracks
and thats what all these machines are doing except instead of doing it with marbles theyre doing it with electrons
and then we jump to von neumann when he sort of reinvents the whole same thing
and after the war the electronics existed to actually try and build such a machine
so june actually the bomb hasnt even been dropped yet and von neumann is putting together all the theory to actually build this thing which also goes back to turing who before that gave the idea that you could do all this with a very brainless little finite state machine just reading a tape in and reading a tape out
the other sort of genesis of what von neumann did was the difficulty of how you would predict the weather
lewis richardson saw how you could do this with a cellular array of people giving them each a little chunk and putting it together
here we have an electrical model illustrating a mind having a will but capable of only two ideas
and thats really the simplest computer
its basically why you need the qubit because it only has two ideas
and you put lots of those together you get the essentials of the modern computer the arithmetic unit the central control the memory the recording medium the input and the output
but theres one catch this is the fatal you know we saw it in starting these programs up
the instructions which govern this operation must be given in absolutely exhaustive detail
so the programming has to be perfect or it wont work
if you look at the origins of this the classic history sort of takes it all back to the eniac here
but actually the machine im going to tell you about the institute for advanced study machine which is way up there really should be down there so im trying to revise history and give some of these guys more credit than theyve had
such a computer would open up universes which are at the present outside the range of any instruments
so it opens up a whole new world and these people saw it
the guy who was supposed to build this machine was the guy in the middle vladimir zworykin from rca
rca in probably one of the lousiest business decisions of all time decided not to go into computers
but the first meetings november were at rcas offices
rca started this whole thing off and said you know televisions are the future not computers
the essentials were all there all the things that make these machines run
von neumann and a logician and a mathematician from the army put this together then they needed a place to build it
when rca said no thats when they decided to build it in princeton where freeman works at the institute
thats where i grew up as a kid
thats me thats my sister esther whos talked to you before so we both go back to the birth of this thing
thats freeman a long time ago and that was me
and this is von neumann and morgenstern who wrote the theory of games
all these forces came together there in princeton
oppenheimer who had built the bomb
the machine was actually used mainly for doing bomb calculations
and julian bigelow who took zworkykins place as the engineer to actually figure out using electronics how you would build this thing the whole gang of people who came to work on this and women in front who actually did most of the coding were the first programmers
these were the prototype geeks the nerds
they didnt fit in at the institute
this is a letter from the director concerned about especially unfair on the matter of sugar
you can read the text
this is hackers getting in trouble for the first time
these were not theoretical physicists
they were real soldering gun type guys and they actually built this thing
and we take it for granted now that each of these machines has billions of transistors doing billions of cycles per second without failing
they were using vacuum tubes very narrow sloppy techniques to get actually binary behavior out of these radio vacuum tubes
they actually used the common radio tube because they found they were more reliable than the more expensive tubes
and what they did at the institute was publish every step of the way
reports were issued so that this machine was cloned at other places around the world
and it really was it was the original microprocessor
all the computers now are copies of that machine
the memory was in cathode ray tubes a whole bunch of spots on the face of the tube very very sensitive to electromagnetic disturbances
so theres of these tubes like a v engine running the memory
the input and the output was by teletype tape at first
this is a wire drive using bicycle wheels
this is the archetype of the hard disk thats in your machine now
then they switched to a magnetic drum
this is modifying ibm equipment which is the origins of the whole data processing industry later at ibm
and this is the beginning of computer graphics
the graphg beam turn on this next slide thats the as far as i know the first digital bitmap display
so von neumann was already off in a theoretical cloud doing abstract sorts of studies of how you could build reliable machines out of unreliable components
those guys drinking all the tea with sugar in it were writing in their logbooks trying to get this thing to work with all these vacuum tubes that failed half the time
and thats what ive been doing this last six months is going through the logs
running time two minutes input output minutes
this includes a large amount of human error
so they are always trying to figure out whats machine error whats human error
whats code whats hardware
thats an engineer gazing at tube number trying to figure out why the memorys not in focus
he had to focus the memory seems ok
so he had to focus each tube just to get the memory up and running let alone having you know software problems
no use went home
impossible to follow the damn thing wheres a directory
so already theyre complaining about the manuals before closing down in disgust the general arithmetic operating logs
burning lots of midnight oil
maniac which became the acronym for the machine mathematical and numerical integrator and calculator lost its memory
maniac regained its memory when the power went off machine or human
aha so they figured out its a code problem
found trouble in code i hope
code error machine not guilty
damn it i can be just as stubborn as this thing
and the dawn came so they ran all night
twenty four hours a day this thing was running mainly running bomb calculations
everything up to this point is wasted time whats the use good night
master control off the hell with it way off
somethings wrong with the air conditioner smell of burning v belts in the air
a short do not turn the machine on
ibm machine putting a tar like substance on the cards the tar is from the roof
so they really were working under tough conditions
here a mouse has climbed into the blower behind the regulator rack set blower to vibrating result no more mouse
here lies mouse born died a m may
theres an inside joke someone has penciled in here lies marston mouse
if youre a mathematician you get that because marston was a mathematician who objected to the computer being there
picked a lightning bug off the drum running at two kilocycles
thats two thousand cycles per second yes im chicken so two kilocycles was slow speed
the high speed was kilocycles
i dont know if you remember a mac that was megahertz thats slow speed
i have now duplicated both results
how will i know which is right assuming one result is correct
this now is the third different output
i know when im licked
weve duplicated errors before
machine run fine code isnt
only happens when the machine is running
and sometimes things are okay
machine a thing of beauty and a joy forever perfect running
parting thought when theres bigger and better errors well have them
so nobody was supposed to know they were actually designing bombs
theyre designing hydrogen bombs but someone in the logbook late one night finally drew a bomb
so that was the result it was mike the first thermonuclear bomb in
that was designed on that machine in the woods behind the institute
so von neumann invited a whole gang of weirdos from all over the world to work on all these problems
barricelli he came to do what we now call really artificial life trying to see if in this artificial universe he was a viral geneticist way way way ahead of his time
hes still ahead of some of the stuff thats being done now
trying to start an artificial genetic system running in the computer
began his universe started march
so its almost exactly its years ago next tuesday i guess
and he saw everything in terms of he could read the binary code straight off the machine
he had a wonderful rapport
other people couldnt get the machine running it always worked for him
even errors were duplicated
dr barricelli claims machine is wrong code is right
so he designed this universe and ran it
when the bomb people went home he was allowed in there
he would run that thing all night long running these things if anybody remembers stephen wolfram who reinvented this stuff
and he published it it wasnt locked up and disappeared
it was published in the literature
if its that easy to create living organisms why not create a few yourself
so he decided to give it a try to start this artificial biology going in the machines
and he found all these sort of it was like a naturalist coming in and looking at this tiny byte universe and seeing all these things happening that we see in the outside world in biology
this is some of the generations of his universe
but theyre just going to stay numbers theyre not going to become organisms
they have to have something
you have a genotype and you have to have a phenotype
they have to go out and do something and he started doing that started giving these little numerical organisms things they could play with playing chess with other machines and so on
and they did start to evolve
and he went around the country after that
every time there was a new fast machine he started using it and saw exactly whats happening now
that the programs instead of being turned off when you quit the program youd keep running and basically all the sorts of things like windows is doing running as a multi cellular organism on many machines he envisioned all that happening
and he saw that evolution itself was an intelligent process
it wasnt any sort of creator intelligence but the thing itself was a giant parallel computation that would have some intelligence
and he went out of his way to say that he was not saying this was lifelike or a new kind of life
it just was another version of the same thing happening
and theres really no difference between what he was doing in the computer and what nature did billions of years ago
and could you do it again now
so when i went into these archives looking at this stuff lo and behold the archivist came up one day saying i think we found another box that had been thrown out
and it was his universe on punch cards
so there it is years later sitting there sort of suspended animation
thats the instructions for running this is actually the source code for one of those universes with a note from the engineers saying theyre having some problems
there must be something about this code that you havent explained yet
and i think thats really the truth we still dont understand how these very simple instructions can lead to increasing complexity
whats the dividing line between when that is lifelike and when it really is alive
these cards now thanks to me showing up are being saved
and the question is should we run them or not
you know could we get them running
do you want to let it loose on the internet
these machines would think they these organisms if they came back to life now whether theyve died and gone to heaven theres a universe
my laptop is thousand million times the size of the universe that they lived in when barricelli quit the project
he was thinking far ahead to how this would really grow into a new kind of life
and thats whats happening
when juan enriquez told us about these trillion bits being transferred back and forth of all this genomics data going to the proteomics lab thats what barricelli imagined that this digital code in these machines is actually starting to code it already is coding from nucleic acids
weve been doing that since you know since we started pcr and synthesizing small strings of dna
and real soon were actually going to be synthesizing the proteins and like steve showed us that just opens an entirely new world
its a world that von neumann himself envisioned
this was published after he died his sort of unfinished notes on self reproducing machines what it takes to get the machines sort of jump started to where they begin to reproduce
it took really three people barricelli had the concept of the code as a living thing von neumann saw how you could build the machines that now last count four million of these von neumann machines is built every hours and julian bigelow who died days ago this is john markoffs obituary for him he was the important missing link the engineer who came in and knew how to put those vacuum tubes together and make it work
and all our computers have inside them the copies of the architecture that he had to just design one day sort of on pencil and paper
and we owe a tremendous credit to that
and he explained in a very generous way the spirit that brought all these different people to the institute for advanced study in the to do this project and make it freely available with no patents no restrictions no intellectual property disputes to the rest of the world
thats the last entry in the logbook when the machine was shut down july
and its julian bigelow who was running it until midnight when the machine was officially turned off
and thats the end
thank you very much

title don norman ways good design makes you happy title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript in this talk from design critic don norman turns his incisive eye toward beauty fun pleasure and emotion as he looks at design that makes people happy he names the three emotional cues that a well designed product must hit to succeed description
the new me is beauty
yeah people used to say normans ok but if you followed what he said everything would be usable but it would be ugly
well i didnt have that in mind so
this is neat
thank you for setting up my display
i mean its just wonderful
and i havent the slightest idea of what it does or what its good for but i want it
and thats my new life
my new life is trying to understand what beauty is about and pretty and emotions
the new me is all about making things kind of neat and fun
and so this is a philippe starck juicer produced by alessi
its just neat its fun its so much fun i have it in my house but i have it in the entryway i dont use it to make juice
in fact i bought the gold plated special edition and it comes with a little slip of paper that says dont use this juicer to make juice
the acid will ruin the gold plating
so actually i took a carton of orange juice and i poured it in the glass to take this picture
beneath it is a wonderful knife
its a global cutting knife made in japan
first of all look at the shape its just wonderful to look at
second of all its really beautifully balanced it holds well it feels well
and third of all its so sharp it just cuts
its a delight to use
and so its got everything right
its beautiful and its functional
and i can tell you stories about it which makes it reflective and so youll see i have a theory of emotion
and those are the three components
hiroshi ishii and his group at the mit media lab took a ping pong table and placed a projector above it and on the ping pong table they projected an image of water with fish swimming in it
and as you play ping pong whenever the ball hits part of the table the ripples spread out and the fish run away
but of course then the ball hits the other side the ripples hit the poor fish they cant find any peace and quiet
is that a good way to play ping pong
no but is it fun
yeah yeah
or look at google
if you type in oh say emotion and design you get pages of results
so google just took their logo and they spread it out
instead of saying you got results
this is one through next they just give you as many os as there are pages
its really simple and subtle
i bet a lot of you have seen it and never noticed it
thats the subconscious mind that sort of notices it it probably is kind of pleasant and you didnt know why
and its just clever
and of course whats especially good is if you type design and emotion the first response out of those pages is my website
now the weird thing is google lies because if i type design and emotion it says you dont need the and we do it anyway
so ok
so i type design emotion and my website wasnt first again
it was third
oh well different story
there was this wonderful review in the new york times about the mini cooper automobile
it said you know this is a car that has lots of faults
buy it anyway
its so much fun to drive
and if you look at the inside of the car i mean i loved it i wanted to see it i rented it this is me taking a picture while my son is driving and the inside of the car the whole design is fun
its round its neat
the controls work wonderfully
so thats my new life its all about fun
i really have the feeling that pleasant things work better and that never made any sense to me until i finally figured out look
im going to put a plank on the ground
so imagine i have a plank about two feet wide and feet long and im going to walk on it and you see i can walk on it without looking i can go back and forth and i can jump up and down
no problem
now im going to put the plank feet in the air and im not going to go near it thank you
intense fear paralyzes you
it actually affects the way the brain works
so paul saffo before his talk said that he didnt really have it down until just a few days or hours before the talk and that anxiety was really helpful in causing him to focus
thats what fear and anxiety does it causes you to be whats called depth first processing to focus not be distracted
and i couldnt force myself across that
now some people can circus workers steel workers
but it really changes the way you think
and then a psychologist alice isen did this wonderful experiment
she brought students in to solve problems
so shed bring people into the room and thered be a string hanging down here and a string hanging down here
it was an empty room except for a table with a bunch of crap on it some papers and scissors and stuff
and shed bring them in and shed say this is an iq test and it determines how well you do in life
would you tie those two strings together
so theyd take one string and theyd pull it over here and they couldnt reach the other string
still cant reach it
and basically none of them could solve it
you bring in a second group of people and you say oh before we start i got this box of candy and i dont eat candy
would you like the box of candy
and turns out they liked it and it made them happy not very happy but a little bit of happy
and guess what they solved the problem
and it turns out that when youre anxious you squirt neural transmitters in the brain which focuses you makes you depth first
and when youre happy what we call positive valence you squirt dopamine into the prefrontal lobes which makes you a breadth first problem solver youre more susceptible to interruption you do out of the box thinking
thats what brainstorming is about right
with brainstorming we make you happy we play games and we say no criticism and you get all these weird neat ideas
but in fact if thats how you always were youd never get any work done because youd be working along and say oh i got a new way of doing it
so to get work done youve got to set a deadline right
youve got be anxious
the brain works differently if youre happy things work better because youre more creative
you get a little problem you say ah ill figure it out
no big deal
theres something i call the visceral level of processing and there will be visceral level design
biology we have co adapted through biology to like bright colors
thats especially good that mammals and primates like fruits and bright plants because you eat the fruit and you thereby spread the seed
theres an amazing amount of stuff thats built into the brain
we dislike bitter tastes we dislike loud sounds we dislike hot temperatures cold temperatures
we dislike scolding voices we dislike frowning faces we like symmetrical faces etc etc
so thats the visceral level
in design you can express visceral in lots of ways like the choice of type fonts and the red for hot exciting
or the jaguar its actually a crummy car falls apart all the time but the owners love it
and its beautiful its in the museum of modern art
a water bottle you buy it because of the bottle not because of the water
and when people are finished they dont throw it away
they keep it for you know its like the old wine bottles you keep it for decoration or maybe fill it with water again which proves its not the water
its all about the visceral experience
the middle level of processing is the behavioral level and thats actually where most of our stuff gets done
visceral is subconscious youre unaware of it
behavioral is subconscious youre unaware of it
almost everything we do is subconscious
im walking around the stage im not attending to the control of my legs
im doing a lot most of my talk is subconscious it has been rehearsed and thought about a lot
most of what we do is subconscious
automatic behavior skilled behavior is subconscious controlled by the behavioral side
and behavioral design is all about feeling in control which includes usability understanding but also the feel and heft
thats why the global knives are so neat
theyre so nicely balanced so sharp that you really feel youre in control of the cutting
or just driving a high performance sports car over a demanding curb again feeling that you are in complete control of the environment
or the sensual feeling
this is a kohler shower a waterfall shower and actually all those knobs beneath are also showerheads
it will squirt you all around and you can stay in that shower for hours and not waste water by the way because it recirculates the same dirty water
or this this is a really neat teapot i found at high tea at the four seasons hotel in chicago
its a ronnefeldt tilting teapot
thats kind of what the teapot looks like but the way you use it is you lay it on its back and you put tea in and then you fill it with water
the water then seeps over the tea
and the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right the tea is to the right of this line
theres a little ledge inside so the tea is sitting there and the water is filling it up like that
and when the tea is ready or almost ready you tilt it
and that means the tea is partially covered while it completes the brewing
and when its finished you put it vertically and now the tea is you remember above this line and the water only comes to here and so it keeps the tea out
on top of that it communicates which is what emotion does
emotion is all about acting emotion is really about acting
its being safe in the world
cognition is about understanding the world emotion is about interpreting it saying good bad safe dangerous and getting us ready to act which is why the muscles tense or relax
and thats why we can tell the emotion of somebody else because their muscles are acting subconsciously except that weve evolved to make the facial muscles really rich with emotion
well this has emotions if you like because it signals the waiter that hey im finished see upright
and the waiter can come by and say would you like more water
its kind of neat what a wonderful design
and the third level is reflective which is if you like the superego its a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do no control over the doesnt see the senses doesnt control the muscles
it looks over whats going on
its that little voice in your head thats watching and saying thats good thats bad
or why are you doing that i dont understand
its that little voice in your head thats the seat of consciousness
heres a great reflective product
owners of the hummer have said you know ive owned many cars in my life all sorts of exotic cars but never have i had a car that attracted so much attention
its about attention its about their image not about the car
if you want a more positive model this is the gm car
and the reason you might buy it now is because you care about the environment
and youll buy it to protect the environment even though the first few cars are going to be really expensive and not perfected
but thats reflective design as well
or an expensive watch so you can impress people oh gee i didnt know you had that watch
as opposed to this one which is a pure behavioral watch which probably keeps better time than the watch i just showed you
but its ugly
this is a clear don norman watch
and whats neat is sometimes you pit one emotion against the other the visceral fear of falling against the reflective state saying its ok its ok its safe its safe
if that amusement park were rusty and falling apart youd never go on the ride
so its pitting one against the other
the other neat thing
so jake cress is this furniture maker and he makes this unbelievable set of furniture
and this is his chair with claw and the poor little chair has lost its ball and its trying to get it back before anybody notices
and whats so neat about it is how you accept that story
and thats whats nice about emotion
so thats the new me
im only saying positive things from now on

title renny gleeson our antisocial phone tricks title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript in this funny minute talk social strategist renny gleeson breaks down our always on social world where the experience were having right now is less interesting than what well tweet about it later description
what i wanted to talk to you about today is two things one the rise of a culture of availability and two a request
so were seeing a rise of this availability being driven by mobile device proliferation globally across all social strata
were seeing along with that proliferation of mobile devices an expectation of availability
and with that comes the third point which is obligation and an obligation to that availability
and the problem is were still working through from a societal standpoint how we allow people to be available
theres a significant delta in fact between what were willing to accept
apologies to hans rosling he said anything thats not using real stats is a lie but the big delta there is how we deal with this from a public standpoint
so weve developed certain tactics and strategies to cover up
this first ones called the lean
and if youve ever been in a meeting where you play sort of meeting chicken youre sitting there looking at the person waiting for them to look away and then quickly checking the device
although you can see the gentleman up on the right is busting him
the stretch
ok the gentleman on the left is saying screw you im going to check my device
but the guy here on the right hes doing the stretch
its that reeeee e e each out the physical contortion to get that device just below the tabletop
or my favorite the love you mean it
nothing says i love you like let me find somebody else i give a damn about
or this one coming to us from india
you can find this on youtube the gentleman whos recumbent on a motorcycle while text messaging
or what we call the sweet gravy stop me before i kill again
that is actually the device
what this is doing is we find a a direct collision we find a direct collision between availability and whats possible through availability and a fundamental human need which weve been hearing about a lot actually the need to create shared narratives
were very good at creating personal narratives but its the shared narratives that make us a culture
and when youre standing with someone and youre on your mobile device effectively what youre saying to them is you are not as important as literally almost anything that could come to me through this device
look around you
there might be somebody on one right now participating in multi dimensional engagement
our reality right now is less interesting than the story were going to tell about it later
this one i love
this poor kid clearly a prop dont get me wrong a willing prop but the kiss thats being documented kind of looks like it sucks
this is the sound of one hand clapping
so as we lose the context of our identity it becomes incredibly important that what you share becomes the context of shared narrative becomes the context in which we live
the stories that we tell what we push out becomes who we are
people arent simply projecting identity theyre creating it
we are creating the technology that is going to create the new shared experience which will create the new world
and so my request is please lets make technologies that make people more human and not less
thank you

title keith chen could your language affect your ability to save money title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript what can economists learn from linguists behavioral economist keith chen introduces a fascinating pattern from his research that languages without a concept for the future it rain tomorrow instead of it will rain tomorrow correlate strongly with high savings rates description
the global economic financial crisis has reignited public interest in something thats actually one of the oldest questions in economics dating back to at least before adam smith
and that is why is it that countries with seemingly similar economies and institutions can display radically different savings behavior
now many brilliant economists have spent their entire lives working on this question and as a field weve made a tremendous amount of headway and we understand a lot about this
what im here to talk with you about today is an intriguing new hypothesis and some surprisingly powerful new findings that ive been working on about the link between the structure of the language you speak and how you find yourself with the propensity to save
let me tell you a little bit about savings rates a little bit about language and then ill draw that connection
lets start by thinking about the member countries of the oecd or the organization of economic cooperation and development
oecd countries by and large you should think about these as the richest most industrialized countries in the world
and by joining the oecd they were affirming a common commitment to democracy open markets and free trade
despite all of these similarities we see huge differences in savings behavior
so all the way over on the left of this graph what you see is many oecd countries saving over a quarter of their gdp every year and some oecd countries saving over a third of their gdp per year
holding down the right flank of the oecd all the way on the other side is greece
and what you can see is that over the last years greece has barely managed to save more than percent of their gdp
it should be noted of course that the united states and the u k are the next in line
now that we see these huge differences in savings rates how is it possible that language might have something to do with these differences
let me tell you a little bit about how languages fundamentally differ
linguists and cognitive scientists have been exploring this question for many years now
and then ill draw the connection between these two behaviors
many of you have probably already noticed that im chinese
i grew up in the midwest of the united states
and something i realized quite early on was that the chinese language forced me to speak about and in fact more fundamentally than that ever so slightly forced me to think about family in very different ways
now how might that be let me give you an example
suppose i were talking with you and i was introducing you to my uncle
you understood exactly what i just said in english
if we were speaking mandarin chinese with each other though i wouldnt have that luxury
i wouldnt have been able to convey so little information
what my language would have forced me to do instead of just telling you this is my uncle is to tell you a tremendous amount of additional information
my language would force me to tell you whether or not this was an uncle on my mothers side or my fathers side whether this was an uncle by marriage or by birth and if this man was my fathers brother whether he was older than or younger than my father
all of this information is obligatory chinese doesnt let me ignore it
and in fact if i want to speak correctly chinese forces me to constantly think about it
now that fascinated me endlessly as a child but what fascinates me even more today as an economist is that some of these same differences carry through to how languages speak about time
so for example if im speaking in english i have to speak grammatically differently if im talking about past rain it rained yesterday current rain it is raining now or future rain it will rain tomorrow
notice that english requires a lot more information with respect to the timing of events
why because i have to consider that and i have to modify what im saying to say it will rain or its going to rain
its simply not permissible in english to say it rain tomorrow
in contrast to that thats almost exactly what you would say in chinese
a chinese speaker can basically say something that sounds very strange to an english speakers ears
they can say yesterday it rain now it rain tomorrow it rain
in some deep sense chinese doesnt divide up the time spectrum in the same way that english forces us to constantly do in order to speak correctly
is this difference in languages only between very very distantly related languages like english and chinese
actually no
so many of you know in this room that english is a germanic language
what you may not have realized is that english is actually an outlier
it is the only germanic language that requires this
for example most other germanic language speakers feel completely comfortable talking about rain tomorrow by saying morgen regnet es quite literally to an english ear it rain tomorrow
this led me as a behavioral economist to an intriguing hypothesis
could how you speak about time could how your language forces you to think about time affect your propensity to behave across time
you speak english a futured language
and what that means is that every time you discuss the future or any kind of a future event grammatically youre forced to cleave that from the present and treat it as if its something viscerally different
now suppose that that visceral difference makes you subtly dissociate the future from the present every time you speak
if thats true and it makes the future feel like something more distant and more different from the present thats going to make it harder to save
if on the other hand you speak a futureless language the present and the future you speak about them identically
if that subtly nudges you to feel about them identically thats going to make it easier to save
now this is a fanciful theory
im a professor i get paid to have fanciful theories
but how would you actually go about testing such a theory
well what i did with that was to access the linguistics literature
and interestingly enough there are pockets of futureless language speakers situated all over the world
this is a pocket of futureless language speakers in northern europe
interestingly enough when you start to crank the data these pockets of futureless language speakers all around the world turn out to be by and large some of the worlds best savers
just to give you a hint of that lets look back at that oecd graph that we were talking about
what you see is that these bars are systematically taller and systematically shifted to the left compared to these bars which are the members of the oecd that speak futured languages
what is the average difference here
five percentage points of your gdp saved per year
over years that has huge long run effects on the wealth of your nation
now while these findings are suggestive countries can be different in so many different ways that its very very difficult sometimes to account for all of these possible differences
what im going to show you though is something that ive been engaging in for a year which is trying to gather all of the largest datasets that we have access to as economists and im going to try and strip away all of those possible differences hoping to get this relationship to break
and just in summary no matter how far i push this i cant get it to break
let me show you how far you can do that
one way to imagine that is i gather large datasets from around the world
so for example there is the survey of health and retirement in europe
from this dataset you actually learn that retired european families are extremely patient with survey takers
so imagine that youre a retired household in belgium and someone comes to your front door
excuse me would you mind if i peruse your stock portfolio
do you happen to know how much your house is worth do you mind telling me
would you happen to have a hallway thats more than meters long
if you do would you mind if i timed how long it took you to walk down that hallway
would you mind squeezing as hard as you can in your dominant hand this device so i can measure your grip strength
how about blowing into this tube so i can measure your lung capacity
the survey takes over a day
combine that with a demographic and health survey collected by usaid in developing countries in africa for example which that survey actually can go so far as to directly measure the hiv status of families living in for example rural nigeria
combine that with a world value survey which measures the political opinions and fortunately for me the savings behaviors of millions of families in hundreds of countries around the world
take all of that data combine it and this map is what you get
what you find is nine countries around the world that have significant native populations which speak both futureless and futured languages
and what im going to do is form statistical matched pairs between families that are nearly identical on every dimension that i can measure and then im going to explore whether or not the link between language and savings holds even after controlling for all of these levels
what are the characteristics we can control for
well im going to match families on country of birth and residence the demographics what sex their age their income level within their own country their educational achievement a lot about their family structure
it turns out there are six different ways to be married in europe
and most granularly i break them down by religion where there are categories of religions in the world so an extreme level of granularity
there are billion different ways that a family can find itself
now effectively everything im going to tell you from now on is only comparing these basically nearly identical families
its getting as close as possible to the thought experiment of finding two families both of whom live in brussels who are identical on every single one of these dimensions but one of whom speaks flemish and one of whom speaks french or two families that live in a rural district in nigeria one of whom speaks hausa and one of whom speaks igbo
now even after all of this granular level of control do futureless language speakers seem to save more
yes futureless language speakers even after this level of control are percent more likely to report having saved in any given year
does this have cumulative effects
yes by the time they retire futureless language speakers holding constant their income are going to retire with percent more in savings
can we push this data even further
yes because i just told you we actually collect a lot of health data as economists
now how can we think about health behaviors to think about savings
well think about smoking for example
smoking is in some deep sense negative savings
if savings is current pain in exchange for future pleasure smoking is just the opposite
its current pleasure in exchange for future pain
what we should expect then is the opposite effect
and thats exactly what we find
futureless language speakers are to percent less likely to be smoking at any given point in time compared to identical families and theyre going to be to percent less likely to be obese by the time they retire and theyre going to report being percent more likely to have used a condom in their last sexual encounter
i could go on and on with the list of differences that you can find
its almost impossible not to find a savings behavior for which this strong effect isnt present
my linguistics and economics colleagues at yale and i are just starting to do this work and really explore and understand the ways that these subtle nudges cause us to think more or less about the future every single time we speak
ultimately the goal once we understand how these subtle effects can change our decision making we want to be able to provide people tools so that they can consciously make themselves better savers and more conscious investors in their own future
thank you very much

title elizabeth murchison fighting a contagious cancer title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript what is killing the tasmanian devil a virulent cancer is infecting them by the thousands and unlike most cancers its contagious researcher elizabeth murchison tells us how shes fighting to save the taz and what shes learning about all cancers from this unusual strain contains disturbing images of facial cancer description
everyones familiar with cancer but we dont normally think of cancer as being a contagious disease
the tasmanian devil has shown us that not only can cancer be a contagious disease but it can also threaten an entire species with extinction
so first of all what is a tasmanian devil
many of you might be familiar with taz the cartoon character the one that spins around and around and around
but not many people know that there actually is a real animal called the tasmanian devil and its the worlds largest carnivorous marsupial
a marsupial is a mammal with a pouch like a kangaroo
the tasmanian devil got its name from the terrifying nocturnal scream that it makes
the tasmanian devil is predominantly a scavenger and it uses its powerful jaws and its sharp teeth to chomp on the bones of rotting dead animals
tasmanian devil is found only on the island of tasmania which is that small island just to the south of the mainland of australia
and despite their ferocious appearance tasmanian devils are actually quite adorable little animals
in fact growing up in tasmania it always was incredibly exciting when we got a chance to see a tasmanian devil in the wild
but the tasmanian devil population has been undergoing a really extremely fast decline
and in fact theres concern that the species could go extinct in the wild within to years
and the reason for that is the emergence of a new disease a contagious cancer
the story begins in when a wildlife photographer took this photograph here of a tasmanian devil with a large tumor on its face
at the time this was thought to be a one off
animals just like humans sometimes get strange tumors
however we now believe that this is the first sighting of a new disease which is now an epidemic spreading through tasmania
the disease was first sighted in the northeast of tasmania in and has spread across tasmania like a huge wave
now theres only a small part of the population which remains unaffected
this disease appears first as tumors usually on the face or inside the mouth of affected tasmanian devils
these tumors inevitably grow into larger tumors such as these ones here
and the next image im going to show is quite gruesome
but inevitably these tumors progress towards being enormous ulcerating tumors like this one here
this one in particular sticks in my mind because this is the first case of this disease that i saw myself
and i remember the horror of seeing this little female devil with this huge ulcerating foul smelling tumor inside her mouth that had actually cracked off her entire lower jaw
she hadnt eaten for days
her guts were swimming with parasitic worms
her body was riddled with secondary tumors
and yet she was feeding three little baby tasmanian devils in her pouch
of course they died along with the mother
they were too young to survive without their mother
in fact in the area where she comes from more than percent of the tasmanian devil population has already died of this disease
scientists around the world were intrigued by this cancer this infectious cancer that was spreading through the tasmanian devil population
and our minds immediately turned to cervical cancer in women which is spread by a virus and to the aids epidemic which is associated with a number of different types of cancer
all the evidence suggested that this devil cancer was spread by a virus
however we now know and ill tell you right now that we know that this cancer is not spread by a virus
in fact the infectious agent of disease in this cancer is something altogether more sinister and something that we hadnt really thought of before
but in order for me to explain what that is i need to spend just a couple of minutes talking more about cancer itself
cancer is a disease that affects millions of people around the world every year
one in three people in this room will develop cancer at some stage in their lives
i myself had a tumor removed from my large intestine when i was only
cancer occurs when a single cell in your body acquires a set of random mutations in important genes that cause that cell to start to produce more and more and more copies of itself
paradoxically once established natural selection actually favors the continued growth of cancer
natural selection is survival of the fittest
and when you have a population of fast dividing cancer cells if one of them acquires new mutations which allow them to grow more quickly acquire nutrients more successfully invade the body theyll be selected for by evolution
thats why cancer is such a difficult disease to treat
it evolves
throw a drug at it and resistant cells will grow back
an amazing fact is that given the right environment and the right nutrients a cancer cell has the potential to go on growing forever
however cancer is constrained by living inside our bodies and its continued growth its spreading through our bodies and eating away at our tissues leads to the death of the cancer patient and also to the death of the cancer itself
so cancer could be thought of as a strange short lived self destructive life form an evolutionary dead end
but that is where the tasmanian devil cancer has acquired an absolutely amazing evolutionary adaptation
and the answer came from studying the tasmanian devil cancers dna
this was work from many people but im going to explain it through a confirmatory experiment that i did a few years ago
the next slide is going to be gruesome
this is jonas
hes a tasmanian devil that we found with a large tumor on his face
and being a geneticist im always interested to look at dna and mutations
so i took this opportunity to collect some samples from jonas tumor and also some samples from other parts of his body
i took these back to the lab
i extracted dna from them
and when i looked at the sequence of the dna and compared the sequence of jonas tumor to that of the rest of his body i discovered that they had a completely different genetic profile
in fact jonas and his tumor were as different from each other as you and the person sitting next to you
what this told us was that jonas tumor did not arise from cells of his own body
in fact more genetic profiling told us that this tumor in jonas actually probably first arose from the cells of a female tasmanian devil and jonas was clearly a male
so how come a tumor that arose from the cells of another individual is growing on jonas face
well the next breakthrough came from studying hundreds of tasmanian devil cancers from all around tasmania
we found that all of these cancers shared the same dna
think about that for a minute
that means that all of these cancers actually are the same cancer that arose once from one individual devil that have broken free of that first devils body and spread through the entire tasmanian devil population
but how can a cancer spread in a population
well the final piece of the puzzle came when we remember how devils behave when they meet each other in the wild
they tend to bite each other often quite ferociously and usually on the face
we think that cancer cells actually come off the tumor get into the saliva
when the devil bites another devil it actually physically implants living cancer cells into the next devil so the tumor continues to grow
so this tasmanian devil cancer is perhaps the ultimate cancer
its not constrained by living within the body that gave rise to it
it spreads through the population has mutations that allow it to evade the immune system and its the only cancer that we know of thats threatening an entire species with extinction
but if this can happen in tasmanian devils why hasnt it happened in other animals or even humans
well the answer is it has
this is kimbo
hes a dog that belongs to a family in mombasa in kenya
last year his owner noticed some blood trickling from his genital region
she took him to the vet and the vet discovered something quite disgusting
and if youre squeamish please look away now
he discovered this a huge bleeding tumor at the base of kimbos penis
the vet diagnosed this as transmissible venereal tumor a sexually transmitted cancer that affects dogs
and just as the tasmanian devil cancer is contagious through the spread of living cancer cells so is this dog cancer
but this dog cancer is quite remarkable because it spread all around the world
and in fact these same cells that are affecting kimbo here are also found affecting dogs in new york city in mountain villages in the himalayas and in outback australia
we also believe this cancer might be very old
in fact genetic profiling tells that it may be tens of thousands of years old which means that this cancer may have first arisen from the cells of a wolf that lived alongside the neanderthals
this cancer is remarkable
its the oldest mammalian derived life form that we know of
its a living relic of the distant past
so weve seen that this can happen in animals
could cancers be contagious between people
well this is a question which fascinated chester southam a cancer doctor in the
ad he decided to put this to the test by actually deliberately inoculating people with cancer from somebody else
and this is a photograph of dr southam in injecting cancer into a volunteer who in this case was an inmate in ohio state penitentiary
most of the people that dr southam injected did not go on to develop cancer from the injected cells
but a small number of them did and they were mostly people who were otherwise ill whose immune systems were probably compromised
what this tells us ethical issues aside is that
its probably extremely rare for cancers to be transferred between people
however under some circumstances it can happen
and i think that this is something that oncologists and epidemiologists should be aware of in the future
so just finally cancer is an inevitable outcome of the ability of our cells to divide and to adapt to their environments
but that does not mean that we should give up hope in the fight against cancer
in fact i believe given more knowledge of the complex evolutionary processes that drive cancers growth we can defeat cancer
my personal aim is to defeat the tasmanian devil cancer
lets prevent the tasmanian devil from being the first animal to go extinct from cancer
thank you

title derek paravicini and adam ockelford in the key of genius title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript born three and a half months prematurely derek paravicini is blind and has severe autism but with perfect pitch innate talent and a lot of practice he became an acclaimed concert pianist by the age of here his longtime piano teacher adam ockelford explains his student s unique relationship to music while paravicini shows how he has ripped up the chopsticks rule book description
adam ockelford i promise there wont be too much of me talking and a lot of derek playing but i thought it would just be nice to recap on how derek got to where he is today
its amazing now because hes so much bigger than me but when derek was born he could have fitted on the palm of your hand
he was born three and a half months premature and really it was a fantastic fight for him to survive
he had to have a lot of oxygen and that affected your eyes derek and also the way you understand language and the way you understand the world
but that was the end of the bad news because when derek came home from the hospital his family decided to employ the redoubtable nanny who was going to look after you derek really for the rest of your childhood
and nannys great insight really was to think heres a child who cant see
music must be the thing for derek
and sure enough she sang or as derek called it warbled to him for his first few years of life
and i think it was that excitement with hearing her voice hour after hour every day that made him think maybe you know in his brain something was stirring some sort of musical gift
heres a little picture of derek going up now when you were with your nanny
now nannys great other insight was to think perhaps we should get derek something to play and sure enough she dragged this little keyboard out of the loft never thinking really that anything much would come of it
but derek your tiny hand must have gone out to that thing and actually bashed it bashed it so hard they thought it was going to break
but out of all the bashing after a few months emerged the most fantastic music and i think there was just a miracle moment really derek when you realized that all the sounds you hear in the world out there is something that you can copy on the keyboard
that was the great eureka moment
now not being able to see meant of course that you taught yourself
derek paravicini i taught myself to play
ao you did teach yourself to play and as a consequence playing the piano for you derek was a lot of knuckles and karate chops and even a bit of nose going on in there
and now heres what nanny did also do was to press the record button on one of those little early tape recorders that they had and this is a wonderful tape now of derek playing when you were four years old
dp molly malone
ao it wasnt actually cockles and mussels
this one is english country garden
dp english country garden
ao there you are
i think thats just fantastic
you know theres this little child who cant see cant really understand much about the world has no one in the family who plays an instrument and yet he taught himself to play that
and as you can see from the picture there was quite a lot of body action going on while you were playing derek
now along derek and i met when he was four and a half years old and at first derek i thought you were mad to be honest because when you played the piano you seemed to want to play every single note on the keyboard and also you had this little habit of hitting me out of the way
so as soon as i tried to get near the piano i was firmly shoved off
and having said to your dad nic that i would try to teach you i was then slightly confused as to how i might go about that if i wasnt allowed near the piano
but after a while i thought well the only way is to just pick you up shove derek over to the other side of the room and in the seconds that i got before derek came back i could just play something very quickly for him to learn
and in the end derek i think you agreed that we could actually have some fun playing the piano together
as you can see theres me in my early pre marriage days with a brown beard and little derek concentrating there
i just realized this is going to be recorded isnt it right okay
now then by the age of derek really had taken the world by storm
this is a photo of you derek playing at the barbican with the royal philharmonic pops
basically it was just an exciting journey really
and in those days derek you didnt speak very much and so there was always a moment of tension as to whether youd actually understood what it was we were going to play and whether youd play the right piece in the right key and all that kind of thing
but the orchestra were wowed as well and the press of the world were fascinated by your ability to play these fantastic pieces
now the question is how do you do it derek
and hopefully we can show the audience now how it is you do what you do
i think that one of the first things that happened when you were very little derek was that by the time you were two your musical ear had already outstripped that of most adults
and so whenever you heard any note at all if i just play a random note you knew instantly what it was and youd got the ability as well to find that note on the piano
now thats called perfect pitch and some people have perfect pitch for a few white notes in the middle of the piano
you can see how you get a sense of playing with derek
but derek your ear is so much more than that
if i just put the microphone down for a bit im going to play a cluster of notes
those of you who can see will know how many notes but derek of course cant
not only can you say how many notes its being able to play them all at the same time here we are
well forget the terminology derek fantastic
and its that ability that ability to hear simultaneous sounds not only just single sounds but when a whole orchestra is playing derek you can hear every note and instantly through all those hours and hours of practice reproduce those on the keyboard that makes you i think is the basis of all your ability
now then
its no use having that kind of raw ability without the technique and luckily derek you decided that once we did start learning youd let me help you learn all the scale fingerings
so for example using your thumb under with c major
etc
and in the end you got so quick that things like flight of the bumblebee were no problem were they
dp no
ao right so here by the age of derek was playing things like this
dp this
ao derek lets have a bow
well done
now the truly amazing thing was with all those scales derek you could not only play flight of the bumblebee in the usual key but any note i play derek can play it on
so if i just choose a note at random like that one
can you play flight of the bumblebee on that note
dp flight of the bumblebee on that note
ao or another one how about in g minor
dp g minor
ao fantastic well done derek
so you see in your brain derek is this amazing musical computer that can instantly recalibrate recalculate all the pieces in the world that are out there
most pianists would have a heart attack if you said sorry do you mind playing flight of the bumblebee in b minor instead of a minor as we went on
in fact the first time derek you played that with an orchestra youd learned the version that youd learned and then the orchestra in fact did have a different version so while we were waiting in the two hours before the rehearsal and the concert derek listened to the different version and learned it quickly and then was able to play it with the orchestra
fantastic chap
the other wonderful thing about you is memory
dp memory ao your memory is truly amazing and every concert we do we ask the audience to participate of course by suggesting a piece derek might like to play
and people say well thats terribly brave because what happens if derek doesnt know it
and i say no its not brave at all because if you ask for something that derek doesnt know youre invited to come and sing it first and then hell pick it up
so just be thoughtful before you suggest something too outlandish
but seriously would anyone like to choose a piece
dp choose a piece choose choose would you like to choose ao because its quite dark youll just have to shout out
would you like to hear me play
ao paganini dp the theme of paganini
ao well done
dereks going to l a soon and its a milestone because it means that derek and i will have spent over hours on long haul flights together which is quite interesting isnt it derek
dp very interesting adam yes long haul flights yes
ao you may think hours is a long time to keep talking but derek does it effortlessly now then
but in america theyve coined this term the human ipod for derek which i think is just missing the point really because derek youre so much more than an ipod
youre a fantastic creative musician and i think that was nowhere clearer to see really than when we went to slovenia and someone in a longer concert we tend to get people joining in and this person very very nervously came onto the stage
dp he played chopsticks ao and played chopsticks
dp chopsticks
ao a bit like this dp like this yes
ao i should really get dereks manager to come and play it
hes sitting there
dp somebody played chopsticks like this ao just teasing right here we go
dp let derek play it
ao what did you do with it derek
dp i got to improvise with it adam
ao this is derek the musician
keep up with derek
the ted people will kill me but perhaps theres time for one encore
dp for one encore ao one encore yes
so this is one of dereks heroes
its the great art tatum dp art tatum
ao who also was a pianist who couldnt see and also i think like derek thought that all the world was a piano so whenever art tatum plays something it sounds like theres three pianos in the room
and here is dereks take on art tatums take on tiger rag

title bjorn lomborg global priorities bigger than climate change title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript given billion to spend which would you solve first aids or global warming danish political scientist bjorn lomborg comes up with surprising answers description
what id like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world
im not going to talk about the skeptical environmentalist probably thats also a good choice
but i am going talk about what are the big problems in the world
and i must say before i go on i should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because im actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that
so get out your pen and paper
bottom line is there is a lot of problems out there in the world
im just going to list some of them
there are million people starving
theres a billion people without clean drinking water
two billion people without sanitation
there are several million people dying of hiv and aids
the lists go on and on
theres two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change so on
there are many many problems out there
in an ideal world we would solve them all but we dont
we dont actually solve all problems
and if we do not the question i think we need to ask ourselves and thats why its on the economy session is to say if we dont do all things we really have to start asking ourselves which ones should we solve first
and thats the question id like to ask you
if we had say billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world where should we spend it
we identified of the biggest challenges in the world and i will just briefly read them climate change communicable diseases conflicts education financial instability governance and corruption malnutrition and hunger population migration sanitation and water and subsidies and trade barriers
we believe that these in many ways encompass the biggest problems in the world
the obvious question would be to ask what do you think are the biggest things
where should we start on solving these problems
but thats a wrong problem to ask
that was actually the problem that was asked in davos in january
but of course theres a problem in asking people to focus on problems
because we cant solve problems
surely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die
but we dont have a technology to solve that right
so the point is not to prioritize problems but the point is to prioritize solutions to problems
and that would be of course that gets a little more complicated
to climate change that would be like kyoto
to communicable diseases it might be health clinics or mosquito nets
to conflicts it would be u n s peacekeeping forces and so on
the point that i would like to ask you to try to do is just in seconds and i know this is in a sense an impossible task write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities
and also and thats of course where economics gets evil to put down what are the things we should not do first
what should be at the bottom of the list
please just take seconds perhaps talk to your neighbor and just figure out what should be the top priorities and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have to the worlds biggest issues
the amazing part of this process and of course i mean i would love to i only have minutes ive already given you quite a substantial amount of my time right
id love to go into and get you to think about this process and thats actually what we did
and i also strongly encourage you and im sure well also have these discussions afterwards to think about how do we actually prioritize
of course you have to ask yourself why on earth was such a list never done before
and one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable
nobody wants to do this
of course every organization would love to be on the top of such a list
but every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list
and since there are many more not number one spots on the list than there is number ones it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list
weve had the u n for almost years yet weve never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world and said which of them should we do first
so it doesnt mean that we are not prioritizing any decision is a prioritization so of course we are still prioritizing if only implicitly and thats unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the prioritization and went in and talked about it
so what im proposing is really to say that we have for a very long time had a situation when weve had a menu of choices
there are many many things we can do out there but weve not had the prices nor the sizes
we have not had an idea
imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card but you have no idea what the price is
you know you have a pizza youve no idea what the price is
it could be at one dollar it could be dollars
it could be a family size pizza it could be a very individual size pizza right
wed like to know these things
and that is what the copenhagen consensus is really trying to do to try to put prices on these issues
and so basically this has been the copenhagen consensus process
we got of the worlds best economists three in each area
so we have three of worlds top economists write about climate change
what can we do what will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that
likewise in communicable diseases
three of the worlds top experts saying what can we do
what would be the price
what should we do about it and what will be the outcome
and so on
then we had some of the worlds top economists eight of the worlds top economists including three nobel laureates meet in copenhagen in may
we called them the dream team
the cambridge university prefects decided to call them the real madrid of economics
that works very well in europe but it doesnt really work over here
and what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list
and then you ask why economists
and of course im very happy you asked that question because thats a very good question
the point is of course if you want to know about malaria you ask a malaria expert
if you want to know about climate you ask a climatologist
but if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first you cant ask either of them because thats not what they do
that is what economists do
they prioritize
they make that in some ways disgusting task of saying which one should we do first and which one should we do afterwards
so this is the list and this is the one id like to share with you
of course you can also see it on the website and well also talk about it more im sure as the day goes on
they basically came up with a list where they said there were bad projects basically projects where if you invest a dollar you get less than a dollar back
then theres fair projects good projects and very good projects
and of course its the very good projects we should start doing
im going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects
these were the bad projects
as you might see the bottom of the list was climate change
this offends a lot of people and thats probably one of the things where people will say i shouldnt come back either
and id like to talk about that because thats really curious
why is it it came up
and ill actually also try to get back to this because its probably one of the things that well disagree with on the list that you wrote down
the reason why they came up with saying that kyoto or doing something more than kyoto is a bad deal is simply because its very inefficient
its not saying that global warming is not happening
its not saying that its not a big problem
but its saying that what we can do about it is very little at a very high cost
what they basically show us the average of all macroeconomic models is that kyoto if everyone agreed would cost about billion dollars a year
thats a substantial amount of money
thats two to three times the global development aid that we give the third world every year
yet it would do very little good
all models show it will postpone warming for about six years in
so the guy in bangladesh who gets a flood in can wait until
which is a little good but not very much good
so the idea here really is to say well weve spent a lot of money doing a little good
and just to give you a sense of reference the u n actually estimate that for half that amount for about billion dollars a year we could solve all major basic problems in the world
we could give clean drinking water sanitation basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet
so we have to ask ourselves do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good
or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good
and that is really why it becomes a bad project
its not to say that if we had all the money in the world we wouldnt want to do it
but its to say when we dont its just simply not our first priority
the fair projects notice im not going to comment on all these but communicable diseases scale of basic health services just made it simply because yes scale of basic health services is a great thing
it would do a lot of good but its also very very costly
again what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation
if you look at the good projects a lot of sanitation and water projects came in
again sanitation and water is incredibly important but it also costs a lot of infrastructure
so id like to show you the top four priorities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world
the fourth best problem is malaria dealing with malaria
the incidence of malaria is about a couple of people get infected every year
it might even cost up towards a percentage point of gdp every year for affected nations
if we invested about billion dollars over the next four years we could bring that incidence down to half
we could avoid about people dying but perhaps more importantly we could avoid about a people getting infected every year
we would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with of course in the long run also to deal with global warming
this third best one was free trade
basically the model showed that if we could get free trade and especially cut subsidies in the u s and europe we could basically enliven the global economy to an astounding number of about billion dollars a year half of which would accrue to the third world
again the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty very radically fast in about two to five years
that would be the third best thing we could do
the second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition
not just malnutrition in general but theres a very cheap way of dealing with malnutrition namely the lack of micronutrients
basically about half of the worlds population is lacking in iron zinc iodine and vitamin a
if we invest about billion dollars we could make a severe inroad into that problem
that would be the second best investment that we could do
and the very best project would be to focus on hiv aids
basically if we invest billion dollars over the next eight years we could avoid new million cases of hiv aids
again what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with hiv aids
one is treatment the other one is prevention
and again in an ideal world we would do both
but in a world where we dont do either or dont do it very well we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first
and treatment is much much more expensive than prevention
so basically what this focuses on is saying we can do a lot more by investing in prevention
basically for the amount of money that we spend we can do x amount of good in treatment and times as much good in prevention
so again what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment at first rate
what this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities
id like to have you look at your priority list and say did you get it right
or did you get close to what we came up with here
well of course one of the things is climate change again
i find a lot of people find it very very unlikely that we should do that
we should also do climate change if for no other reason simply because its such a big problem
but of course we dont do all problems
there are many problems out there in the world
and what i want to make sure of is if we actually focus on problems that we focus on the right ones
the ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good
and i think actually thomas schelling one of the participants in the dream team he put it very very well
one of things that people forget is that in years when were talking about most of the climate change impacts will be people will be much much richer
even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the u n
estimate that the average person in the developing world in will be about as rich as we are today
much more likely they will be two to four times richer than we are
and of course well be even richer than that
but the point is to say when we talk about saving people or helping people in bangladesh in were not talking about a poor bangladeshi
were actually talking about a fairly rich dutch guy
and so the real point of course is to say do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little years from now a fairly rich dutch guy
or do we want to help real poor people right now in bangladesh who really need the help and whom we can help very very cheaply
or as schelling put it imagine if you were a rich as you will be a rich chinese a rich bolivian a rich congolese in thinking back on and saying how odd that they cared so much about helping me a little bit through climate change and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather and my great grandfather whom they could have helped so much more and who needed the help so much more
so i think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight
even if it doesnt accord to the typical way we see this problem
of course thats mainly because climate change has good pictures
we have you know the day after tomorrow it looks great right
its a good film in the sense that i certainly want to see it right but dont expect emmerich to cast brad pitt in his next movie digging latrines in tanzania or something
it just doesnt make for as much of a movie
so in many ways i think of the copenhagen consensus and the whole discussion of priorities as a defense for boring problems
to make sure that we realize its not about making us feel good
its not about making things that have the most media attention but its about making places where we can actually do the most good
the other objections i think that are important to say is that im somehow or we are somehow positing a false choice
of course we should do all things in an ideal world i would certainly agree
i think we should do all things but we dont
in the developed world decided we were going to spend twice as much as we did right now than in on the developing world
since then our aid has halved
so it doesnt look like were actually on the path of suddenly solving all big problems
likewise people are also saying but what about the iraq war
you know we spend billion dollars why dont we spend that on doing good in the world
im all for that
if any one of you guys can talk bush into doing that thats fine
but the point of course is still to say if you get another billion dollars we still want to spend that in the best possible way dont we
so the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right priorities
i should just mention briefly is this really the right list that we got out
you know when you ask the worlds best economists you inevitably end up asking old white american men
and theyre not necessarily you know great ways of looking at the entire world
so we actually invited young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem
the only two requirements were that they were studying at the university and they spoke english
the majority of them were first from developing countries
they had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion and they certainly did to come up with their own lists
and the surprising thing was that the list was very similar with malnutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom
weve done this many other times
theres been many other seminars and university students and different things
they all come out with very much the same list
and that gives me great hope really in saying that i do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities and saying what is the important thing in the world
of course in an ideal world again wed love to do everything
but if we dont do it then we can start thinking about where should we start
i see the copenhagen consensus as a process
we did it in and we hope to assemble many more people getting much better information for
map out the right path for the world but also to start thinking about political triage
to start thinking about saying lets do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost not the things that we dont know how to do but lets do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good at very low cost right now
at the end of the day you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these but we have to be honest and frank about saying if theres some things we do there are other things we dont do
if we worry too much about some things we end by not worrying about other things
so i hope this will help us make better priorities and think about how we better work for the world
thank you

title bill gates mosquitos malaria and education title
description ted talk subtitles and transcript bill gates hopes to solve some of the worlds biggest problems using a new kind of philanthropy in a passionate and yes funny minutes he asks us to consider two big questions and how we might answer them description
i wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation sharing some of the problems
and warren buffet had recommended i do that being honest about what was going well what wasnt and making it kind of an annual thing
a goal i had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems because i think there are some very important problems that dont get worked on naturally
that is the market does not drive the scientists the communicators the thinkers the governments to do the right things
and only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to
so this morning im going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand
but before i dive into those i want to admit that i am an optimist
any tough problem i think it can be solved
and part of the reason i feel that way is looking at the past
over the past century average lifespan has more than doubled
another statistic perhaps my favorite is to look at childhood deaths
as recently as million children were born and million of those died before the age of five
five years ago million children were born so more and less than million of them died before the age of five
so thats a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate
its a phenomenal thing
each one of those lives matters a lot
and the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs vaccines that were used more widely
for example measles was four million of the deaths back as recently as and now is under
so we really can make changes
the next breakthrough is to cut that million in half again
and i think thats doable in well under years
why well theres only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths diarrhea pneumonia and malaria
so that brings us to the first problem that ill raise this morning which is how do we stop a deadly disease thats spread by mosquitos
well whats the history of this disease
its been a severe disease for thousands of years
in fact if we look at the genetic code its the only disease we can see that people who lived in africa actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths
deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the
so it was absolutely gigantic
and the disease was all over the world
a terrible disease it was in the united states it was in europe
people didnt know what caused it until the early when a british military man figured out that it was mosquitos
so it was everywhere
and two tools helped bring the death rate down
one was killing the mosquitos with ddt
the other was treating the patients with quinine or quinine derivatives
and so thats why the death rate did come down
now ironically what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones which is where the rich countries are
so we can see its everywhere
its still most places
the u s and most of europe have gotten rid of it
youve gotten most of the northern areas
and more recently you can see its just around the equator
and so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poorer countries it doesnt get much investment
for example theres more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria
now baldness its a terrible thing
and rich men are afflicted
and so thats why that priority has been set
but malaria even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact
over million people at any one time are suffering from it
it means that you cant get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so much
now malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos
i brought some here just so you could experience this
well let those roam around the auditorium a little bit
theres no reason only poor people should have the experience
so weve come up with a few new things weve got bed nets
and bed nets are a great tool
what it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night so the mosquitos that bite late at night cant get at them
and when you use indoor spraying with ddt and those nets you can cut deaths by over percent
and thats happened now in a number of countries
its great to see
but we have to be careful because malaria the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves
so every tool that weve ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective
and so you end up with two choices
if you go into a country with the right tools and the right way you do it vigorously you can actually get a local eradication
and thats where we saw the malaria map shrinking
or if you go in kind of half heartedly for a period of time youll reduce the disease burden but eventually those tools will become ineffective and the death rate will soar back up again
and the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didnt pay attention
now were on the upswing
bed net funding is up
theres new drug discovery going on
our foundation has backed a vaccine thats going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months
and that should save over two thirds of the lives if its effective
so were going to have these new tools
but that alone doesnt give us the road map
because the road map to get rid of this disease involves many things
it involves communicators to keep the funding high to keep the visibility high to tell the success stories
it involves social scientists so we know how to get not just percent of the people to use the bed nets but percent
we need mathematicians to come in and simulate this to do monte carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together
of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise
we need rich world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things
and so as these elements come together im quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria
now let me turn to a second question a fairly different question but id say equally important
and this is how do you make a teacher great
it seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on and wed understand very well
and the answer is really that we dont
lets start with why this is important
well all of us here ill bet had some great teachers
we all had a wonderful education
thats part of the reason were here today part of the reason were successful
i can say that even though im a college drop out
i had great teachers
in fact in the united states the teaching system has worked fairly well
there are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places
so the top percent of students have gotten a good education
and those top percent have been the best in the world if you measure them against the other top percent
and theyve gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the u s at the forefront
now the strength for those top percent is starting to fade on a relative basis but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting
not only has that been weak its getting weaker
and if you look at the economy it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education
and we have to change this
we have to change it so that people have equal opportunity
we have to change it so that the country is strong and stays at the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education like science and mathematics
when i first learned the statistics i was pretty stunned at how bad things are
over percent of kids never finish high school
and that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate as the number who started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year
because they werent tracking where the kids were before that
but most of the dropouts had taken place before that
they had to raise the stated dropout rate as soon as that tracking was done to over percent
for minority kids its over percent
and even if you graduate from high school if youre low income you have less than a percent chance of ever completing a college degree
if youre low income in the united states you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four year degree
and that doesnt seem entirely fair
so how do you make education better
now our foundation for the last nine years has invested in this
theres many people working on it
weve worked on small schools weve funded scholarships weve done things in libraries
a lot of these things had a good effect
but the more we looked at it the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing
and we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers between say the top quartile the very best and the bottom quartile
how much variation is there within a school or between schools
and the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable
a top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class based on test scores by over percent in a single year
what does that mean
that means that if the entire u s for two years had top quartile teachers the entire difference between us and asia would go away
within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away
so its simple all you need are those top quartile teachers
and so youd say wow we should reward those people
we should retain those people
we should find out what theyre doing and transfer that skill to other people
but i can tell you that absolutely is not happening today
what are the characteristics of this top quartile
what do they look like
you might think these must be very senior teachers
and the answer is no
once somebody has taught for three years their teaching quality does not change thereafter
the variation is very very small
you might think these are people with masters degrees
theyve gone back and theyve gotten their masters of education
this chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality
that bottom thing which says theres no effect at all is a masters degree
now the way the pay system works is theres two things that are rewarded
one is seniority
because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension
the second is giving extra money to people who get their masters degree
but it in no way is associated with being a better teacher
teach for america slight effect
for math teachers majoring in math theres a measurable effect
but overwhelmingly its your past performance
and weve done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in and to replicate it to raise the average capability or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system
you might say do the good teachers stay and the bad teachers leave
the answer is on average the slightly better teachers leave the system
and its a system with very high turnover
now there are a few places very few where great teachers are being made
a good example of one is a set of charter schools called kipp
kipp means knowledge is power
its an unbelievable thing
they have schools mostly middle schools some high schools and what goes on is great teaching
they take the poorest kids and over percent of their high school graduates go to four year colleges
and the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public schools
theyre team teaching theyre constantly improving their teachers
theyre taking data the test scores and saying to a teacher hey you caused this amount of increase
theyre deeply engaged in making teaching better
when you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms at first its very bizarre
i sat down and i thought what is going on
the teacher was running around and the energy level was high
i thought im in the sports rally or something
whats going on
and the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids werent paying attention which kids were bored and calling kids rapidly putting things up on the board
it was a very dynamic environment because particularly in those middle school years fifth through eighth grade keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention nobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who doesnt want to be there
everybody needs to be involved
and so kipp is doing it
how does that compare to a normal school
well in a normal school teachers arent told how good they are
the data isnt gathered
in the teachers contract it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom sometimes to once per year
and they need advanced notice to do that
so imagine running a factory where youve got these workers some of them just making crap and the management is told hey you can only come down here once a year but you need to let us know because we might actually fool you and try and do a good job in that one brief moment
even a teacher who wants to improve doesnt have the tools to do it
they dont have the test scores and theres a whole thing of trying to block the data
for example new york passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure decision for the teachers
and so thats sort of working in the opposite direction
but im optimistic about this i think there are some clear things we can do
first of all theres a lot more testing going on and thats given us the picture of where we are
and that allows us to understand whos doing it well and call them out and find out what those techniques are
of course digital video is cheap now
putting a few cameras in the classroom and saying that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis is very practical in all public schools
and so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say ok heres a little clip of something i thought i did well
heres a little clip of something i think i did poorly
advise me when this kid acted up how should i have dealt with that
and they could all sit and work together on those problems
you can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff
you can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course learn from that
if you have a kid whos behind you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept
and in fact these free courses could not only be available just on the internet but you could make it so that dvds were always available and so anybody who has access to a dvd player can have the very best teachers
and so by thinking of this as a personnel system we can do it much better
now theres a book actually about kipp the place that this is going on that jay matthews a news reporter wrote called work hard be nice
and i thought it was so fantastic
it gave you a sense of what a good teacher does
im going to send everyone here a free copy of this book
now we put a lot of money into education and i really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a future as it should have
in fact we have in the stimulus bill its interesting the house version actually had money in it for these data systems and it was taken out in the senate because there are people who are threatened by these things
but i im optimistic
i think people are beginning to recognize how important this is and it really can make a difference for millions of lives if we get it right
i only had time to frame those two problems
